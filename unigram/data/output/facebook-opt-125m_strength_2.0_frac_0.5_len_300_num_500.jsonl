{"prefix": "Q: Why do \"at-will\" employment states have probation periods at work?\nA:", "gold_completion": "In most cases, employees do not get access to many of the company's benefits, such as accruing vacation/sick leave, retirement plan contributions, or other perks. So it's less about having an \"out\" for the company to let go an unsatisfactory employee, but saving money on them by not giving them full compensation till they \"prove\" themselves.", "gen_completion": [" Whenever an employer is required or obliged to agree to deal with a special employment provision that may need special time or notice, either employer will often qualify it to its short-term requirements. A current employer is required by law to deal with special employment provision only when it is more difficult or more necessary than previously required. Employment laws vary around the world, with some states offering many time and notice periods while others permit or impose many.\nIt is important to remember that exceptions are made in many states where different types of employment agreements are required. As these rules change, these laws may change too, or employers may choose in which states they will find loopholes. For example, in Oregon, a program with more time was required to cover ill-equipped teachers. Also, in Washington state, special employment agreements with jurisdictions where other employment requirements are required may apply if the state is expanding in-state employment or simply closing in-state employment. Unlike Oregon, where special employment agreements are required in some jurisdictions, Washington, which is normally more challenging, is often more difficult.\nIt is also important to remember that \"at-will\" employment is limited to temporary, single-time employment under conditions of service, although, where it is required in other circumstances, only temporary employment arrangements. If a state gives it, it is within its reach. The exceptions in Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and Montana, are notable.\nThese states, in particular, provide exemptions for any employment conditions covered under these statutes"]}
{"prefix": "Q: What\u2019s the difference between something being unlawful and something being illegal?\nA:", "gold_completion": "To some degree, those are synonyms.\nLoosely but not in any strict legal sense, \u201cillegal\u201d more often refers to an action that constitutes a crime \u2014 a violation of the law that can subject the actor to criminal prosecution by the government, leading to a conviction, a criminal record, and potentially a custodial sentence.\nLoosely but not in any strict legal sense, \u201cunlawful\u201d more often refers to an action that constitutes any contravention of any law, even if that contravention of the law cannot lead to criminal penalties. Some common examples of something unlawful but not criminal might include committing a civil wrong against a person (say, breaking your lease), or being late in paying a fine, or remaining in the country without legal status.\nWhen the government itself fails to comply with a statute or regulation, that too is more likely to be termed \u201cunlawful\u201d than \u201cillegal.\u201d", "gen_completion": [" For people, it is, in general, something that is illegal, that is illegal, and it\u2019s quite different from something being lawful or lawful in any sense. For people, it is, in general, something where it\u2019s sometimes lawful. For people, it is, in general, something where it is, in general, something where it\u2019s even worse. For people, it is, in general, something where it is illegal. (or something entirely, like) instead of what it was illegally legal, I think this will, in general, change what people in this case say is what is illegal.\nI think the important thing is, if they are making calls, or if it\u2019s talking like, a phone call or whatever it\u2019s called, it\u2019s just not something that is illegal. That\u2019s the only way in which it\u2019s illegal. Because it\u2019s legal in the sense that it is. For people, it is, in general, something where it\u2019s in this sense. The other way is, if I get arrested in this way, I get arrested in this way, and I can\u2019t watch television in this way, I\u2019ll just not watch television in this way. It\u2019s just illegal in this way. I think it\u2019s what people here find really frustrating, in general. (laughs) But it\u2019s been"]}
