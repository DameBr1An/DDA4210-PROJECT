                "There certainly did exist an Islamic underworld which offered access to forbidden fruits, though few if any of our sources for it date to this early in the Muslim period. If we move a couple of hundred years later, however, we can begin to find references to a company of rogues and criminals known as the Banu Sasan in a scattering of Islamic texts from *maqamat* ~~(popular)~~ literature. \n\nOne of the best known was Abu Dulaf al-Khazraji, a self-proclaimed king of vagabonds more often noted as the author of a text apparently describing a 10th century Samanid embassy to China, who secured a tenuous position among the entourage of a vizier of Isfahan, Ibn Abbad, by telling sordid, titillating, tales of the underworld.\n\n“I am of the company of beggar lords,” Abu Dulaf boasts in one account,\n\n > The cofraternity of the outstanding ones,\n\n > One of the Banu Sasan…\n\n > And the sweetest way of life we have experienced \n\n > Is one spent in sexual indulgence and wine drinking.\n\n > For we are the lads, the only lads who really matter, on land and sea.\n\nOf course, that reads better in the original Persian...\n\nOur sources are united in suggesting that a large proportion of the Banu Sasan were Kurds, a people seen by other Middle Eastern peoples as brigands and predators. They also show that the criminal slang they employed drew on a wide variety of languages. Much of it has its origins in what Johann Fück has termed “Middle Arabic,” but the remainder seems to be derived from everything from Byzantine Greek to Persian, Hebrew and Syriac.\n\nUltimately, however, what strikes one most about the Banu Sasan is their remarkable inclusiveness. At one extreme lie the men of violence; ar-Raghib al-Isfahani lists five separate categories of thug, from the housebreaker to out-and-out killers such as the *sahib ba’j*, the “disemboweler and ripper-open of bellies,” and the *sahib radkh*, the “crusher and pounder” who accompanies lone travellers on their journeys and then, when his victim has prostrated himself in prayer, “creeps up and hits him simultaneously over the head with two smooth stones.” But at the other lie the poets, among them the mysterious Al-Ukbari—of whom we are told little more than that he was “the poet of rogues, their elegant exponent and the wittiest of them all.”\n\nSadly, from the point of view of this query, the majority of the literature dealing with the Banu Sasen (most importantly the *Kashf al-asrar*, an obscure work by the Syrian writer Jaubari that dates to around 1235, and translates as *Unveiling of Secrets*) is fairly practical, and is devoted to setting out the various (often quite remarkable) crimes they committed, so that the reader could avoid being rooked by them – not to the details of their debauches. If this sort of thing is of any interest, I wrote about it in considerable detail (with more sources), [here](_URL_0_).",
                "Ok, two things first: To answer this I fear I have to cheat a little and extent the time period that you’re asking about by a few decades into the time of the Umayyad Caliphate. I think we simply don’t really have enough information about the earliest times of the Caliphate under the rule of the Rashidun to paint a lively picture. This also moves the geographical area away from Medina and the Hejaz to the north into the steppes of Greater Syria from where the Umayyad clan ruled their continent spanning empire.\n\nSecond, I think I may have a bit of a surprise for you when it comes to the attitudes people in the early Caliphate had towards the drinking of whine and debauchery as a hole. When modern people, muslim and non muslim alike, think about the early times of the Caliphate they normally imagine a society that is tightly regulated by the norms of the Sharia. However although those norms certainly are based on guidelines that were already laid down in the times of the Prophet and the Rashidun Caliphs they weren’t really codified into law yet so to speak. Back then the formative years of islamic law that saw the establishment of the great law schools of the Hanfis, Malikis, Shafi’i`s and Hanbalis lay still in the future. That means when it came to the question whether it was allowed to drink alcohol or not all that early Muslims had to guide them were the verses of the Quran and the remembered attitudes of Mohammed. And those could be quite contradictory. Some verses are quite clear in their condemnation of alcohol:\n\n >  O ye who believe! Strong drink and games of chance and idols and divining arrows are only an infamy of Satan's handiwork. Leave it aside in order that ye may succeed. (5,90)\n\nBut then another verse has this to say:\n\n >  O ye who believe! Draw not near unto prayer when ye are drunken, till ye know that which ye utter, nor when ye are polluted, save when journeying upon the road, till ye have bathed. (4,43)\n\nHere it seems that drunkenness isn’t totally forbidden or it wouldn’t be necessary to clarify that you can’t be drunken when you want to pray. Another verse even seems to praise the drinking of wine:\n\n >  And of the fruits of the date-palm, and grapes, whence ye derive strong drink and (also) good nourishment. Lo! therein is indeed a portent for people who have sense. (6,67)\n\nNow as I said, in later times those contradictory comments would be translated into a more (although still not totally) coherent set of laws by the great islamic law schools. But we would be wise not to project those later attitudes on earlier times. So while the drinking of alcohol was certainly frowned upon by more rigorous characters it wasn’t necessarily forbidden in Umayyad times.\n\nWith that out of the way we can turn to the Umayyads themselves. They were the family that monopolized the office of the Caliphate for themselves from the end of the Rashidun until they were overthrown by a rival dynasty, the Abbasids, in 750 AD. Under their rule the center of the Caliphate shifted from the Hejaz to Syria in the north where they already had been able to build a strong power base. Here they developed a sophisticated court culture that mixed elements from pre islamic Arabia with those from the Late Antique Roman and Persian Empires which they had recently conquered. The most striking witnesses to this new elite culture were the so called ‘desert palaces’ which the members of the Umayyad aristocracy build in the steppes of Greater Syria. Their still impressive ruins can today be visited in the modern states of Syria, Libanon, Jordan and the Palestinian territories.\n\nOne example from Jordan would be small palace of Qusayr Amra in modern Jordan. It is relatively [modest in size](_URL_0_) but contains a really marvelous set of frescoes. The main building seems to combine the function of throne room and bath house. In it we find scenes that are familiar from Late Roman and Persian court culture like [hunting scenes](_URL_1_) or a ruler on his throne. And as is fitting for a bath house we also see quite a few [nude figures](_URL_3_), most of them [women](_URL_4_). Similar depictions are known from other desert castles like [this](_URL_2_) stucco statue from Khirbat al Mafjar in Palestine. It’s probably safe to assume that they’re more or less representative of the real debauchery that could be found in those aristocratic palaces. \n\nLiterary sources that tell about the Umayyads often seem to confirm this picture. In his book *Walid and his friends. An Umayyad Tragedy* (1988) Robert Hamilton relates a story from the *Khitab al Aghani* (book of songs) from the 10th century about the poet Abu Harun Utarrad who is invited to the palace of Caliph Al Walid II. He is summoned to the bath house where the ruler awaits him sitting at the edge of a bathtub filled with wine. The Caliph listens to the poet’s songs and afterward he strips off his precious garment, climbs into the tub and doesn’t come out of it until the level of wine is lowered significantly. After leaving the tub he immediately passes out so that the poet is able to steal away with the Caliph’s garment. The same scene repeats at the next evening but at the third day the poet is instead summoned to the throne room. Al Walid tells him that he can leave the palace and go his merry way but only under the condition that he will never tell anybody what he has witnessed here. Luckily for the poet only a few years later the Umayyad dynasty would be overthrown by the Abbasids so that he could freely talk about his experience.\n\nNow stories like this should certainly be taken with more than a grain of salt. After all it was probably quite fashionable to discredit the Umayyads for their sinful lifestyle after the dynasty had lost power and their adversaries had taken control over the Caliphate. But the sumptuous decoration of the Desert Castles strongly implies that they were at least partially based in truth. And not all members of the Umayyad family seem to have been as fond of wine as Al Walid may have been, who earned a reputation as an almost legendary drunkard. His uncle and predecessor Hisham reportedly abstained from drinking wine at all and even scolded his nephew for his debauchery. But then again Hisham himself was also quite famously fond of women and music. \n\nSo we can certainly say that for a member of the Arab elite there were quite a few avenues for vice and wanton pleasure to be had in early islamic times. But they weren’t at all restricted to a glitzy underworld but an integral feature of the court culture of the time. And although I’m not at all an expert on the later islamic Middle Ages I know of a few depictions of later muslim rulers drinking wine that seem to strongly suggest that the Umayyads weren’t the last ones to live this kind of life."

                "Per Wikipedia: \n >  A short circuit...is an electrical circuit that allows a current to travel along an unintended path, often where essentially no (or a very low) electrical impedance is encountered.\n\nAs other users have pointed out, the body does not use the same mechanisms to create a current that electronics use. While it is true that current comes about from the movement of charges particles (classically, the movement of electrons; though, the reality is the opposite case), neurons, neuron fibers, and muscle fibers do not \"push\" these charged particles from one end to the another. The charged particles accomplishing this task in the body are, of course, ions; mainly Potassium, Sodium, Chloride, and Calcium ions. \n\nThe mechanism of current production can get a bit messy in neurons and cells, but the TL;DR of the process is that a current is generated in these cells when there is a net movement of ions *perpendicular, across the cell membrane* that pushes the cell to a certain threshold voltage (either towards the positive or the negative...if you want more detail on this, please ask). This change in what is termed \"membrane potential\" happens locally in a single given spot and, if strong enough, can induce a change in membrane potential in a consecutive spot. The change in potential propagates down the cell (an event that is termed as the propagation of the Action Potential) and eventually reaches the end of it (in the case of the neuron, the change in potential propagates down the axon, and reaches the synapse, where a signal is sent to another neuron/muscle). Herein lies the difference between the \"electric\" cells of the body and the electronic components of a computer. In the body, current flow is generated by moving ions *perpendicularly* across cell membranes; whereas in wires, current is generated by pushing  electrons in a *parallel* fashion from one end to the other.\n\nWith that in mind, to answer your question: can we ever \"short circuit\" an \"electrical\" body circuit? No, you can't; at least not using the classical definition of a short circuit. There are many things that can go wrong with the electrical processes in the body, but they aren't like short circuits in which a path of no resistance blows the circuit. The processes that govern neuron and muscle action are very intriguing, I suggest you look into them and find a good diagram like [this](_URL_0_).\n\nIf you want more information, please ask. I find this all very fascinating. There are also a few cases where there is current flow directly from one cell to another; in such cases, one could say the cells' electrical properties are similar to that of a wire, but only for a very, very short distance and time.\n\nEdit: I completely forgot your other question! I apologize.\n\nWhere is the power source? Simplified answer: everywhere. The energy the cells use to create these action potentials is generally stored in the change in voltage that occurs across the cell membrane. The voltage change induces a shape change in membrane proteins that open or close to let the ions in or out of the cell. When they open or close, this further changes the voltage which can open even more channels to let even more ions in/out. It's a wicked cool positive feedback loop.",
                "Where does the electric current in the body start?",
                "Actually, there is at least one medical condition that does meet the definition of a short circuit: Wolf-Parkinson-White.  It's the result of the derangement of the normal electrophysiology of the heart.\n\nNormally in the electrical depolarization of the heart, an electrical impulse is generated in the sinoatrial node, travels across the atria, and pauses for a brief time (usually less than 0.12 seconds) at the atrioventricular (AV) node before reaching the ventricles (the big muscles at the bottom of the heart that do most of the pumping).  The AV node acts as a gateway for electrical impulses coming from above, limiting the number of electrical depolarizations reaching the ventricles, preserving cardiac output.  \n\nIn Wolf-Parkinson-White, an accessory pathway exists (the bundle of Kent) that allows impulses to bypass the AV node and conduct directly to the ventricles.  If these individuals experience an atrial tachycardia like SVT or atrial fibrillation, it can be life threatening as the ventricles begin beating so fast that they no longer pump an adequate amount of blood to supply the body's need."

                "EDIT: I feel I should make clear that while my area of expertise is the Vietnam War, I do not command expert-level knowledge on Buddhism. Therefore, while I can explain the events leading up to Thich Quang Duc's self immolation, I am unable to explain the roots of that practice in detail. \n\nCatholicism in Vietnam indeed stems from French influence. French missionaries began traveling to Vietnam in the 1600s. The Vietnamese monarchy generally saw Catholicism as a potential threat, and so religious persecution was high for many years. This persecution was one of the main justification France used to begin annexing Vietnam. The ruling Catholic minority in 1963 was Ngo Dinh Diem's government. French colonial rule in Vietnam ended in 1954 when the Viet Minh, an anti colonial group spearheaded by the Indochinese Communist Party, defeated France in the First Indochina War. The US had supported France against the Communist forces throughout much of this conflict. After France's defeat, the US established its own presence in South Vietnam, which was a creation of the peace agreements that ended the war. Under this treaty Vietnam was partitioned in two - the Communists got the North and all other non-Communist groups got the South. Diem was a staunch Catholic as well as Vietnamese patriot who had never collaborated with the French. As such, the Americans considered him untainted - almost everyone else they could have put in power had collaborated in some way, and they didn't want the South Vietnamese government to be associated with colonialism. His Catholicism came into play because some policy makers thought Catholics more trustworthy and anti communist than Buddhists. Buddhism tends to stress neutrality and pacifism, while the Catholic Church had been strongly anti communist for decades. \n\nAfter being elevated to the office of Prime Minister of the State of Vietnam (South Vietnam's official name in 1954) Diem promptly organized a rigged election in which he transformed the State of Vietnam into the Republic of Vietnam, with him as President. In the process he kicked out the last official emperor of Vietnam, Bao Dai. Once in power Diem stacked government positions with his family members and refugee Catholics from the North. He also cracked down on all rival groups, in some cases having popular political or religious figures executed or exiled. All of this created an environment in which many Buddhist monks felt discriminated against. It came to a head in mid 1963, when several monks in the central Vietnamese city of Hue asked permission to fly the Buddhist flag on Buddha's birthday. Under RVN law, only official government flags could be flown outside. This law did not stop Catholic churches from flying the Vatican flag, so the monks did not foresee any problems. But Diem's government denied this request. In response, the monks organized a protest, at which a bomb exploded and killed several people. Diem blamed the incident on the Communists, but the Buddhists blamed his government, and immediately began organizing wider protests against his autocratic policies. Vietnamese Buddhist monks had long practiced self immolation as a means of honoring Buddha, and when Thich Quang Duc did so, he was surrounded by Western reporters, which caused the crisis to become international news.

                "No, Robert E. Lee never said this. This is a mis-quote from an \"interview\" that a reverend named John Leyburn claimed to have had with Robert E. Lee in 1869, several years after the war was over, and a year before Lee's death. \n\nJohn Leyburn had been born in Lexington, Virginia, and was a Presbyterian pastor. At the outbreak of the Civil War, [Leyburn left his church](_URL_9_) and joined the South. He became Secretary of the Board of Publication for the newly-founded Southern Presbyterian Church, since the Presbyterian Church of the United States of America had become officially pro-abolitionist. (The two churches continue to be separate today.) After the war, Leyburn resettled in Baltimore, where he claimed to interview Lee. \n\nAn article by Leyburn was printed in 1885 in *Century Illustrated* magazine, so the quote itself is second-hand knowledge many years after the fact. Leyburn claimed to have asked if Lee had fought the war over the issue of slavery, and he said that Lee denied it. [Leyburn claimed](_URL_0_) that Robert E. Lee told him:\n\n >  \"So far,\" said General Lee, \"from engaging in a war to perpetuate slavery, I am rejoiced that slavery is abolished. I believe it will be greatly for the interests of the South. So fully am I satisified of this, as regards Virginia especially, that I would cheerfully have lost all I have lost by the war, and suffered all I have suffered, to have this objective obtained.\" This he said with much earnestness.\n > \n >  After expressing himself on this point, as well as others in which he felt that Northern writers were greatly misrepresenting the South, he looked at me and, with emphasis, said:\n > \n >  \"Doctor, I think some of you gentlemen that use the pen should see that justice is done us.\"\n\nSo it would seem that this was in part an effort by Lee to resurrect his reputation after the fact. Or, it never happened, and it's something that Leyburn made up himself in order to resurrect Lee's reputation and promote Southern apologist sentiment.\n\nThere is a *bit* of truth to this view of Lee, however. In 1856, several years before the war, Robert E. Lee [wrote a letter to his wife](_URL_3_\") that explained some of his feelings on the subject of slavery, and this letter is used by most biographers as the cornerstone of Lee's personal views on slavery ([1](_URL_2_ & pg=PA173), [2](_URL_1_), [3](_URL_5_)):\n\n >  \"There are few, I believe, in this enlightened age, who will not acknowledge that slavery as an institution is a moral and political evil. It is idle to expatiate on its disadvantages. I think it is a greater evil to the white than to the colored race. While my feelings are strongly enlisted in behalf of the latter, my sympathies are more deeply engaged for the former. The blacks are immeasurably better off here than in Africa, morally, physically, and socially. The painful discipline they are undergoing is necessary for their further instruction as a race, and will prepare them, I hope, for better things. How long their servitude may be necessary is known and ordered by a merciful Providence. \n > \n > Their emancipation will sooner result from the mild and melting influences of Christianity than from the storm and tempest of fiery controversy. This influence, though slow, is sure. The doctrines and miracles of our Saviour have required nearly two thousand years to convert but a small portion of the human race, and even among Christian nations what gross errors still exist! While we see the course of the final abolition of human slavery is still onward, and give it the aid of our prayers, let us leave the progress as well as the results in the hands of Him who, chooses to work by slow influences, and with whom a thousand years are but as a single day.\"\n\nIn other words, though Robert E. Lee felt slavery was a \"moral and political evil\", he also felt it best to leave it in the hands of God to decide, and that slavery would end, eventually, on its own accord, even if that meant a thousand years hence. His letter goes on to say that the abolitionists should know that the way to end slavery is not to \"excite angry feelings in the master\" and that this would only make things worse. Lee's was not an unusual \"moderate\" point of view on slavery in the South in the 1850s.\n\nYet, even though Robert E. Lee may have felt slavery was morally and politically evil, he was not against perpetuating the institution himself. In 1856, his father-in-law, George W. P. Custis, died, and on his death bed, it was reported that he told a group of his slaves that he wanted them emancipated upon his death. But no white person was in the room, and Custis's will stated that they should be freed five years after he died.\n\nThis story reached the Washington D.C. correpsondent of the *Boston Traveller* newspaper, who printed an article about it on December 24, 1857, with the further claim that there were plans to sell some of the slaves down South before the emancipation date came. \n\n[Robert E. Lee responded](_URL_6_) by writing to the *New York Times* on January 8, 1858, denying that Custis had ever said such a thing, that the slaves would be free in five years' time according to the will, and that he had no plans to sell them \"on South\":\n\n >  \"What Mr. Custis is said to have stated to the Washington correspondent of the *Boston Traveller*, or to his assembled slaves, on his death bed is not known to any member of his family. But it is well known that during the brief days of his last illness, he was constantly attended by his daughter, grand-daughter, and niece, and faithfully visited by his physician and pastor. So rapid was the progress of his disease, after its symptoms became alarming, that there was no assembly of his servants, and he took leave of but one, who was present when he bade farewell to his family.\"\n\nWas the *Boston Traveller* passing along false information or was Robert E. Lee telling the truth? It couldn't be proven in a court of law because \"the testimony of negroes will not be taken in Court.\" So it wasn't until 1866 that the testimony of any of Custis's slaves was ever taken, and a former slave named Wesley Norris [refuted Lee's version of events](_URL_8_).\n\nThis had led Norris and several other slaves to try to escape in 1859, but they were caught:\n\n >  \"We were tied firmly to posts by a Mr. Gwin, our overseer, who was ordered by Gen. Lee to strip us to the waist and give us fifty lashes each, excepting my sister, who received but twenty.\"\n\nSo although Robert E. Lee professed a hatred for slavery before the war, and denied he engaged in the war over the issue of slavery after the war, he nonetheless was willing to participate and help preserve the institution both before and during the war. Though he freed some of his slaves before the war, he did not free the last of them [until the war was over](_URL_12_).\n\nLee's views on slavery have continued to be debated by biographers and historians. A century ago, the assessment by pro-Union authors was not kind. In a book about abolitionist John Brown, historian Franklin Benjamin Sanborn [wrote](_URL_11_) of Lee's \"lost cause\" fight for slavery and printed the alleged Leyburn quote. He followed it with his own assessment of it:\n\n >  \"I print this in justice to a brave soldier; but his warfare was as much in defence of slavery as Hector's in defence of Helen, though the great Trojan did not approve of Paris as against Menelaus.\"\n\nMore recently, in discussing Lee's alleged Leyburn quote, historian Charles P. Roland [put it](_URL_15_):\n\n >  If he actually made this statement, he doubtless exaggerated what he would have been willing to do in order to eliminate slavery, but there is compelling evidence that he was sincere in saying he was happy about its elimination (though not over the manner in which this occurred), and that he had not fought in order to preserve it.\n\nEric Foner, Civil War historian and professor at Columbia, [put it succinctly](_URL_10_) by saying, \"[Lee] was not a pro-slavery ideologue. But I think equally important is that, unlike some white southerners, he never spoke out against slavery.\"\n\n\n**Further Reading**:\n\n[Robert E.

                "You certainly could. How well you understood that time-travelling middle republican, however, would depend on your geographic origin and education. \n\nWe tend to think of \"Classical\" Latin - the Latin epitomized by the speeches of Cicero and the poetry of the Augustans - as standard Latin. In reality, nobody ever spoke Classical Latin. Classical Latin was an artificial, literary dialect, founded on the speech of educated Romans in the capital, but never identical to it. All spoken Latin was \"Vulgar\" Latin, informed by its literary cousin to a greater or lesser extent, depending on one's education. \n\nWe know little about spoken Latin in any given place or time. A few texts (such as Petronius' Satyricon) provide tantalizing glimpses. Inscriptions (and especially the graffiti from Pompeii and Herculaneum) tell us more, particularly about pronunciation (traceable from misspellings). From these traces, and from changes in \"Classical\" Latin, we can track broad transformations over the centuries. It is clear, however, that there was always very considerable variety of idiom between regions and classes. \n\nWe know the Latin of c. 200 BC from some helpful inscriptions and a few authors. The earliest well-preserved Latin author is the comedian Plautus, who does seem to reference contemporary colloquial conventions (and admired alliteration). Unfortunately, Plautus' linguistic exuberance (and the fact that he wrote in poetry) makes it difficult to use him as a source for everyday speech. The earliest extant prose author is Cato the Elder, whose work on agriculture has survived. To provide a sample of his Latin:\n\n*Brassica est quae omnibus holeribus antistat. Eam esto vel coctam vel crudam. Crudam si edes, in acetum intinguito. Mirifice concoquit, alvum bonam facit, lotiumque ad omnes res salubre est.* (156)\n\n(It is the cabbage which surpasses all other vegetables. It may be eaten either cooked or raw; if you eat it raw, dip it into vinegar. It promotes digestion marvelously and is an excellent laxative, and the urine is wholesome for everything.)\n\nThis is, of course, literary Latin, but in a very straightforward style probably similar to contemporary conversation. For want of anything better, we might take this as our baseline for spoken Latin in the time of the Punic Wars.\n\nCicero or Caesar would have expressed Cato's sentiment somewhat differently, but nothing in Cato's language was fundamentally different from that of the \"Classical\" Latin masterpieces of the following century. Those masterpieces - the works of Cicero, Virgil, and friends - were still the basis of Latin education in Justinian's time. Latin literature of the sixth century, accordingly, tends not to look too different from that of earlier periods. To take an entertaining example from Pope Gregory the Great's Life of St. Benedict:\n\n...*coepit ipse tremens et palpitans magnis vocibus clamare, dicens Currite, currite, quia draco iste me devorare vult.* (*Dialogues* 2.25)\n\n(...he \\[a recreant monk\\], shaking and trembling, began to loudly cry out, saying: \"run, run \\[to help me\\], for a dragon wishes to devour me!\")\n\nNot quite Ciceronian Latin, but there's nothing here that would have been unintelligible to Cato.  \n\nSpoken Latin had probably deviated much further from \"Classical\" norms by the time of Justinian. It is hard to say, however, how far. The Latin of Rome had always different from the Latin of other parts of Italy, and even more from the Latin of Spain or Gaul. With the disappearance of the western imperial superstructure, and the slower but equally epochal collapse of secular education, these differences became more pronounced. Some changes seem to have taken place everywhere (most famously, prepositions were gradually replacing noun cases). But the nature of one's Latin would always have been a product of origin and education - as would one's intelligibility to a Roman from the age of Cato.\n\nHopefully, someone who knows more about colloquial Latin will be able to add more detail."

                "I'm sure someone can give a much better, detailed answer. And Google can definitely give you a thorough one with pictures. But the gist of the triangle relies on three player forming the vertices of a triangle. Any one of those three players can initiate a play. Typically the triangle is set up between someone at the top of the key, someone on the wing, and someone in the low post. Since the triangle is a half court play, you don't necessarily need a traditional point guard with ball handling skills, hence why Someone atrocious like Derek Fisher was the Lakers starting point guard. The main thing you need is someone who can hit the open J if they are on the outside and someone on the inside who can keep their defender honest. The triangle is unlike a lot of other set plays in that it is fluid and the players forming the triangle need to be able to read and adjust the triangle formation accordingly. Also a reason why scrubs like Luke Walton gets so many minutes from PJ (high IQ). \n\nI've watched the Shaq-Kobe era more extensively than the Bulls era. That team under PJ was so successful in part to the triangle, which masks weaknesses in some of the guys, but also had two of the best 1-on-1 guys the league had ever seen in Kobe and Shaq. You would see them run the triangle during certain sets but PJ would allow Kobe and Shaq to free reign at other times. \n\nTo sum it up, the triangle is successful when guys can knock down perimeter shots and keep their defenders from dropping to the paint to help at the rim. The guy at the rim is good enough to keep their defender honest and guys on the perimeter have to drop low to help out, freeing the perimeter guys to hit wide open shots. \n\nAnd from what I remember, Phil wasn't the mastermind of the triangle. It was Tex Winters I believe. "

                "Primarily by making it happen to a very very small amount of material. 5.5 Trillion degrees sounds like a lot, but in terms of mass x thermal energy, the sample size at that temperate is so small that if you distributed all the energy there into a bucket of water, it wouldn't boil.\n\nThe LHC is aiming to create a very specific set of conditions on a very small sample.  They use a lot of energy to smash stuff together and witness high energy interactions, but it happens using a very small amount of mass.\n\n",
                "I'm not an expert on the LHC, so I'll let someone else explain that, but an important basis for this is the definition of temperature, which is the average kinetic energy in the random movement if particles. It might make more sense to call it the \"average particle shakiness.\"\n\nYour body right now is at about 310 degrees Kelvin (the absolute temperature scale used so that Zero Kelvin is absolute zero, or no shakiness). But you have a massive amount of molecules inside you. For our purposes, let's say it's about a trillion trillions. This means that if we could somehow suck all the thermal energy from your body and put into just 1 trillion molecules, they would each have a temperature in the range of trillions of Kelvin (or Celsius, which is basically the same).\n\nThis doesnt explain HOW energy is given, but hopefully it helps illustrate what temperature means. A single particle at a high temperature is nothing compared to the amount of energy in any visible substance.",
                "A small ice cube melts in minutes and doesnt cool you in the summer. A gigantic ice block can keep a small room cooked for a few hours. That's what happens in the LHC just with heat and not with cold. ",
                "All Celcius in this comment, but it works for any temperature scale. \n\nImagine you have a bucket of water at 80 degrees and another bucket of the same size at 40 degrees. You mix them in a bath tub and then you have water at 60 degrees. Half and half gives you the temperature in the middle.\n\nIf you have a bucket at 23 degrees (room temperature) and a single drop at 99 degrees, mixing them is going to give you a bath tub of water at 23.0001 degrees. Not even close to the middle temperature, but that's because there is not much hot water.\n\nThe same idea applies but there is WAY less than a drop of matter at 5 trillion degrees, it's a few particles (atomic particles) in a machine that weighs thousands of tonnes. ",
                "Every comment in here is explaining why it is safe, but not one person has explained how in the world a temperature measured in trillions of degrees is actually measured.",
                "Nobody seems to have explained how they measure the temperature. Well the short answer is they don't measure it, they calculate it. At that high of temperature there is nothing that can be done to actually measure it as it would melt anything that touched it (ignoring a couple other things that would make this impossible as this is eli5) and the blackbody radiation emmited from it would be such high frequency that we could not measure it based on that, and for samples of this size it would rarely emit even single photons. The way that they figure out the temperature is actually quite simple. They measure the amount of energy they put into or measure the amount of energy that can be extracted and use the amount of energy and the number of particles to figure out the temperature. For example if you put water in the microwave for a minute you would be able to figure out the temperature based on how much water you put in and the power of your microwave.",
                "A bit more eli5 than most other responses I saw. \n\nJust like you can have a light that is very big but dim and a very small light that is incredibly bright you can have a huge amount of heat that is just a bit warm or a tiny amount of heat that is extremely hot. You just can't see the difference like you can with a lamp.\n\nYou can see the effect in ice. A small cube and a big block have the same temperature but the block takes far longer to melt. \n\nIn the LHC the amount of heat is extremely small and over an uncountably short amout of time which makes it very safe to handle",
                "The difference between heat and temperature.\n\nThink about an over heated to 500 degrees for a long enough time that temperature has evened out.  Everything in the oven if 500 degrees.  The sides and bottoms, the racks, the pans, the cast iron skillet, the over cooked turkey, the burned potatoes. . and the air are all 500 degrees.\n\nIf you open the oven and put your hand in it it - it won't burn (right away).  The air is 500 degrees, but there isn't a lot of heat in it - the mass is extremely low.\n\nNow touch the cast iron skillet - your hand will instantly burn.  The cast iron skillet is the exact temperature as the air, but it has tremendously more heat because of its mass. "

                "Architeuthis and Mesonychoteuthis, the giant and colossal squid, are enigmatic and awe inspiring animals. Very little is known about the lifestyle of these spectacular animals, despite the examination of numerous corpses of Architeuthis, much of what we know about the animals' behaviour and lifestyle boils down to educated speculation. What is not so well known is that these modern squid were not the first giant squid in the Earths oceans, we have tantalising remains of animals that were at least as large as these modern species that shared the oceans with the ammonites, mosasaurs, giant turtles and plesiosaurs about 80 million years ago during the Late Cretaceous period. Imagine the difficulties of reconstructing these ancient animals when all we have to go on are fragmentary fossilised remains of the pens, or gladius, of these animals! \n\nTo date two species of Niobrarateuthis have been identified, N. bonneri and N. walkeri. N. bonneri was described by H.W. Miller in 1957 on the basis of three specimens found in the late thirties in the Niobrara Chalk at the Smoky Hills, and N. walkeri in 1977 by R.G. Green on the basis of one very badly crushed specimen. Miller regarded Niobrarateuthis distinct from Tusoteuthis longa in that Tusoteuthis had a lance-shaped gladius and lacked a prominent keel. However, it may be misleading to identify these large squid as separate animals; a 1987 paper by Nicholls and Isaak (1987) has suggested that all five teuthid species from the Western Interior Sea can in fact be regarded as one species, Tusoteuthis longa. The differences in morphology noted above could be explained as artifacts of preservation, deformations caused by crushing during the process of fossilization and misinterpretation of dorsal and ventral surfaces. The sole specimen of the gladius of Niobrarateuthis walkeri was considered by Nicholls and Isaak to be so badly broken and crushed that any attempt at reconstruction would be largely hypothetical. This theory has now achieved general acceptance; all recorded examples of Niobrarateuthis, Kansasteuthis and Enchoteuthis are now in fact regarded as one and the same genus, Tusoteuthis longa. The name Tusoteuthis has been adopted as the common name as it was the earliest name used (Logan 1898) and took precedence over the others.\n\nGiant prehistoric squid are also known from other parts of the world. At Richmond, in Queensland, Australia a 100 million year old 1.3 metre gladius was discovered by 14 year old Sonia Ievers, and has been christened Boreopeltis soniae in her honour. This is currently on display at the Richmond Marine Fossil Museum. Students in Queensland located a contemporary second gladius in 1998 that measured over a meter in length and possibly shows evidence of predation by Kronosaurus, a large pliosaur. Smaller related species of Boreopeltis are known from the Mid Cretaceous (Aptian age) Isle of Heligoland black shale deposits, Heligoland is a small island 50 km off the north German coast and has a 1m thick shale deposit that has preserved a number of fossil teuthid forms in exceptional detail, other genera found there include Mastigophora, Plesioteuthis, Maioteuthis and Trachyteuthis. \n\nBasilosaurusis one of the most common of the primitive whales, called \"archaeocetes\" by paleontologists, that have found in exposures of Middle to Upper Eocene, 35 to 40 million year old, marine sediments within central Louisiana. The species of Basilosaurus found in Louisiana, Basilosaurus cetoides (Owen), had a streamlined body that averaged 45 to 70 feet in length. Its body looked more like the body of a mythical sea serpent rather then the body of a modern whale. Basilosaurus had a wedged-shaped head up to 5 feet long with jaws containing two types of teeth. The teeth in the front, anterior, of the jaw had cone-shaped teeth which caught and held its prey while triangular-shaped teeth in the rear, posterior, of the jaw sliced them up. The type and amount of wear on the teeth of the Basilosaurus indicates that it likely ate fish and squid (Johnston 1991 Carpenter and White 1986).\n\nThe bones of Basilosaurus cetoides (Owen) and other primitive whales have been found throughout a belt across Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama where exposures of Middle and Upper Eocene marine strata, called the Moodys Branch Formation (or Marl) and the Yazoo Clay occur. The vertebrates were so common within some areas of this belt that local residents used them as andirons for fireplaces and blocks to support cabins. The bones and skeletons of Basilosaurus also have been found in Australia, Egypt, within other marine sediments of Upper Eocene age (Domning 1969, Johnston 1991, Thurmond 1981).\n\nHowever, that doesn't mean that basilosaurus ate the squid. They lived far apart from each other time wise."

I have heard that the healing process (not just the scar tissue, actual wound, etc) but the internal process of pulling the uterus back in and toning it as well as bringing the diastasis recti back together can take much longer than a vaginal birth simply because a) your abdomen was sliced open and your body has more to focus on healing, and b) the progesterone \"drop\" that happens right after the baby is pushed out and right before the placenta is pushed out causes you to have after birth pains (contractions) to tighten the uterus and pull it back into position. I have not had a C section, so I can't say if that's true or not, but a neat thing to research. ",
                "As other commenter said, the body knows once the placenta has been delivered. Also the mother is often given an oxytocin analogue injection (she would release her own with skin-to-skin contact with the baby), which triggers the uterus to contract and close down. This is important to limit blood loss after the placenta has separated from the uterus, and the uterus can only really clamp down when it is TOTALLY empty - which is why the delivered placenta has to be carefully checked over to ensure it is all there and none remains in the uterus.

                "Point of clarity before going ahead: I'm using the term \"heretic\" here to describe any person of any denomination that faced judicial proceedings for not conforming to the confession of a particular area. A Catholic in England or a Protestant in Spain both fall in this category, as would an Anabaptist anywhere in Europe besides the Ottoman Empire. \n\nAside from the clergy, it's not as if Catholics, Lutherans or Reformed Protestants dressed entirely differently or had other external signs showing their confessional affiliation. Occasionally there would be some sort of dress regulation within a community, but these were generally enforced at the local level. So for example, a Calvinist consistory or town council in the Protestant Netherlands or Languedoc might have certain regulations about dress or behavior, but these would apply to any covert Catholics that happened to be within the community as well.\n\nFinding crypto-heretics then took some work. The Inquisitions are generally the most well-known searchers of infidelity, but they generally didn't go door-to-door seeking signs of heresy. An Inquisition court (or consistory or town council in Protestant lands) more often than not had people reporting suspicious activity. If someone stopped attending mass, or started baptizing other adults, or began preaching in the pubic square (like Ignatius of Loyola did to garner the attention of the Inquisition), that was generally a good sign that you had a heretic in your midst. Snitching was certainly something that people did, and accounts in Inquisition court records often relied on reputation as much as an observed action in dealing with potential heretics. On the other hand though, by the late sixteenth and early seventeenth century, local parishioners were more interested in sussing out witches than covert Protestants or Catholics. \n\nIf surveillance failed, the main way to figure out someone's denomination was to ask them. Yes, they could lie, and many people did lie. Lutheran, Reformed, Anabaptist and Catholic moral theologians all wrote vehemently against the \"demonic temptation of apostasy,\" but there were qualifications made, especially in the latter half of the sixteenth century, to support individual cases of what was called [Nicodemism](_URL_0_). Lying aside, simply asking was a far more effective way of investigating heresy than one might think. More often than not, heretical thinking was just the result of misguided notions. Inquisitions generally sought to find out where the suspect had fallen into error and correct them, with punishment only coming later. For those that understood full well that they were committing heresy, many of them were okay with facing the penalty. The Reformation saw the resurgence of martyrdom as a transconfessional discourse. People were proud, sometimes even delighted at the idea that they would be killed for the promotion of their faith. Showing steadfast loyalty to the gospel truth (however one defined it) in the face of certain death and torture was an admirable trait, and one that would be rewarded in the afterlife. \n\nGenerally (and I have used that word a lot in this because nothing is the same everywhere) the people that were persecuted for heresy were publishing, preaching or openly speaking against the dominant confession of their area (and often against the local or royal authority therein). There are cases of clandestine heretics, such as Jesuits in England, being \"discovered\" and rooted out, but generally heresy was a public outburst rather than private wrongthink. \n\nN.B: This is not a universal opinion. Some historians would point to the many pogroms or outbreaks of mob violence against suspected heretic groups as evidence against what I have just said. I am merely talking about heresy as a crime being punished in a normally operating government system. \"Suspicious\" persons (whether due to race, nationality or confession) within a community are consistently treated violently throughout history. \n\nSources:\n\nI think a book that gets at the heart of your question is Perez Zagorin's *Ways of Lying,* even if it is not directly about surveilling dogma. One that is a bit more on point for that would be John Tedeschi's *The Inquisition in Early Modern Europe,* but it is a bit of a more difficult read. Brad Gregory's *Salvation at Stake* is indispensable in talking about martyrdom in the Reformation. And of course, no reading list about heresy in early modern Europe would be complete without mentioning Carlo Ginzburg's *The Cheese and the Worms.*"

                "I hate to ask this, but can you track down Given-Wilson's citation?  I ask because sovereigns weren't first minted until the 1480s-90s, I think.\n\nBUT, if Given-Wilson just means pounds (since a sovereign *was* nominally worth a pound), then I can give some insight.  Wool farmer John Lyndewood (father of William Lyndewood, who rose to bishop) left this bequest in his will:\n\n >  Item. I bequeath to the 30 churches in whose parishes I was wont to buy wool that they may pray for my soul and for the souls of those to whom I am beholden, £10, leaving it to the discretion of my executors to choose the villages.\n >  Item. I leave for distribution among poor folk of the country-side, especially in villages where I was wont to buy wool... £10.\n\nTen pounds is a generous amount.  \n\nBased on the UK National Archive's [Currency Converter](_URL_0_), £10 in 1410 is worth ~£6,300 today.  That's an utterly useless number, because spending was entirely different in that sort of economy.  But, more useful, is the table they provide below:\n\n >  In 1410, you could buy one of the following with £10: \n >  Horses: 7 \n >  Cows: 17 \n >  Wool: 55 stones\n >  Wheat: 32 quarters\n >  Wages: 500 days (skilled tradesman)\n\nFirst of all, it's worthwhile to know that 55 stone of wool equals 770 pounds (weight) of wool.  That's ... a lot.  \n\nSecond, five-hundred days of a skilled tradesman's wages isn't exactly clear: do they mean working days?  Are they spreading these wages out over all 365.25 days of the year?  I'm not sure.  What I do know is that they're telling us that it's more than the average artisan makes.  \n\nHopefully this will do until a more comprehensive answer emerges."

                "Hiya!! So house names generally are associated with last names, (Habsburg, hollenherzen, etc.). However I think in the case of A Song of Ice and Fire, this is likely a case of Doylism winning out. In the Middle Ages, the idea of a \"last name\" was not particularly standardized even among the nobility.\n\nMany of the house names we associate with the period are fairly anachronistic, they were attributed by historians after the fact. For example, the French kings are generally referred to as Capetians, but they wouldn't really utilize Capet as a surname, they would be associated with the place or title that a person had, so Louis of France or king of the Franks or king of France. And if we are applying later standards for last names, there would be no changes at all! Let's say that Hugh Capet actually used Capet as a surname. That would mean that every French monarch till the revolution would have the last name Capet. Not only that, but this dynasty was fairly prolific, so the kings of Portugal, the dukes of burgundy, the kind of Sicily, would all have the same last name of Capet using modern standards. \n\nSo generally, house names tend to get applied after the fact, the failure of Philip IV's line marks the start of the Valois dynasty, who were agnatic first cousins of the king, but were also count of Valois. This is also helpful because it breaks up periods, specifically the start of the hundred years' war. This happens in English history too, many of the early noble families who started adopting a practice of last names, tended to associate it with a location, such as their original Norman landholding. Even the houses of Lancaster and York as well as the name Plantagenet are somewhat anachronistic. Richard Duke of York is associated with the house of York, but used Plantagenet kind of as a last name to emphasize his male line succession for Geoffrey of anjou, ancestor of the kings of England, who was nicknamed Plantagenet due to a flower he wore in his hat (he was contending with another Plantagenet, Henry VI). We call him Richard of York and his sons yorkists to clarify factions during The Wars of the Roses (medieval nobles had an annoying habit of reusing maybe five first names all the time). Previous kings did not use a last name, they were associated with their title, \"king of England.\"\n\nSo the main issue here is more that medieval nobility did not use last names in the same sense that we do, they were associated with a place/title (Habsburg from Habsburg castle in Switzerland) or with their father (Louis son of Charles). If they lasted in to the later or modern period, name conventions changed or historians retrospectively added dynastic names for clarity (Plantagenet, carolingian, Capet, etc.). So I think this more is attributed with trying to make things easier for modern readers, who would not appreciate having to keep track of things like just King Robert, whose brother is Lord Stannis of Dragonstone. Last names did come about later in the period, but not in the same strict sense that we have today. The queen of England's style is likely a marker of tradition, harkening back to the medieval practices of association with place. Hope this helps!!"

                "The permanence of a Gothic language in Crimea is a rather problematic question : until recently, the only extensive source about it was Oghier de Busbecq's accounts in his *Turkish Letters* for a Germanic-speaking people living in southern Crimea. At no point he affirms they were Goth, only to say he couldn't tell if they were Goths or Saxons. He nevertheless made a point to list a series of words from one of two, or both peoples, from the region : a native Germanic-speaker having lost much of his native language, and a Greek having learnt enough of it.\n\nIt happens that this part of Crimea, the former principality of Teodoro/Mangup, was also called Gothia by Byzantines : it is not just a late medieval reminiscence of Late Ancient Goths (although, Goths mentions are more probably artefacts in several case) as the Tale of Igor's Campaign does mention \"Gothic maids\" in the XIIth; and the \"Gothic lords\" mentioned in the letter of Zachariah, Prince of Matrega, to the Protectors of the Bank of St. George.Mention of Goths in ecclesiastical titles until the XVIIIth century, however, doesn't imply an ethnic or linguistic survival no more than Gothia (roughly lower Languedoc and Catalonia) and Goths being accounted for in the VIIIth to XIth centuries in southern France _URL_0_ doesn't implies, however, that these Goths kept a distinct ethnic and linguistic identity, no more than early-medieval Gothia (roughly fitting Lower Languedoc, then Catalonia) and its nobles calling themselves Goths until the XIth century.\n\nSo, looking at Busbecq's list, can these words be tied to what we know of Gothic language, trough Ulfila's Bible and other, limited and scattered, sources from the Vth century?It's hard to tell : while there's some phonological elements that makes Crimean Germanic speech relatively close to Ulfila's Gothic language, a lot of phonological and lexical elements seems closer to evolution that happened separately in Low German dialects. While this language might have been called Gothic, it might not have been a direct evolution from Late Ancient Gothic.\n\nWe do have medieval accounts, however, with William De Rebruck and John Galafontibus. It doesn't tells much however.\n\n > There are great bluffs or capes in this sea from Khersona up to the mouths of Don, and forty or so castles between Khersona and Soldaia whom each have its own language; there is also many Goths, that still use German as their languagez\n\n & #x200B;\n\n > Along and around the Black Sea live two small nations: Tats and some Goths. In their religion, they follow the Greeks and use Greek  letters. \\[...\\] Goths can claim to be descended from the Scots and speak like the English.. They live along the shore near Kaffa, and also in Tartary and Cumania.\n\nBut there was certainly a Gothic-speaking population remaining in Crimea, at least until the Xth/XIth century : [in 2015, evidence of Ulfila's Gothic language in this sense was discovered on Mangup's basilica as five graffiti.](_URL_1_) So the question is less if Late Ancient Gothic existed in Crimea, but how long did it survived and why this Germanic speech in late medieval Crimea, while having Ulfila's Gothic elements, tends to look a lot as Low German?\n\nThe traditional opposition is about a distinct Gothic language from Ulfila's Gothic having more or less survived as a scattered idiom even in Crimea, and a medieval western Germanic emerging as German speakers (or Anglo-Saxons if you're following the accounts on Nova Anglia on the Black Sea) settling and being influenced by a remaining Gothic speaking _URL_2_ far, there's not enough evidence to have a clear and definitive answer, although the regular comparison to western German speeches shouldn't be dismissed.\n\nRegardless of its nature, it survived until the XVIIIth from the reading of Johann Christoph Adelung. He basically say that in place where Goths were believed to have lived, some Tatars (originally Christians) speaks a language close to Low German that he was able to understand sometimes.  \nConsidering it means Gothic language, as a direct descendent of Late Ancient Gothic, survived until the XVIIIth is quite optimistic,to say the least, and not an established fact.  \n\n\nWhat do we have then?\n\n\\- Late Ancient Gothic-speakers were still present in Crimea until the Xth century\n\n\\- People identifying themselves and being identified as Goths lived in Crimea at least until the XVIth century, but their language isn't obviously tied to Late Ancient Gothic, explainable either due to a separate evolution, either due to a Low German influence or dominance with Gothic as a substrate.\n\n\\- This Germanic language probably living on until the XVIIIth century."

This led to a raid against Rome itself in 846 by a band of opportunistic Arab mercenaries, who were not numerous or organized enough to breach the city's Aurelian Wall - which was not a huge loss since they were able to load themselves down with booty from churches outside the walls. A second attempted raid in 849 was repulsed at Ostia. \n\nSicily was conquered by Norman forces (with the assistance of local partisans) in the late 11th century.

What the film never showed is that after attacking a muslim caravan during the 1180s, which caused a few skirmishes between the Kingdom of Jerusalem and Saladin, he went on to raid the Red sea coast, his goal being to burn down Mecca and Medina. Problem is, he was pretty much gone rogue in regards to the Kingdom of Jerusalem. His raids were not supported by then King, Baldwin IV. As a result, besides a few coastal villages he didn't raid much and his band of mercenaries were quickly captured and executed while he fled back to his castle. "

                "I would say its because the distances in space are higher, so it moves much less, relatively. Try and take a picture of a mountain while you run on a road. Assuming you can move smoothly (like a spaceprobe) the pics should be clear",
                "A large part of the difference is that this kind of tech is VASTLY beyond the realm of consumer electronics.\n\nThat phone, in total, cost you about $1000.  And that's retail, the actual hardware is significantly cheaper.\n\nA top-notch DSLR costs maybe $3000?  And again, retail pricing.\n\nNew Horizons cost $700,000,000, it's the size of a small car, and it's nuclear powered.  For several hundred thousand times more money, you get camera and stabilization tech that can't even begin to be compared to the stuff they cram into a mass-produced gadget for a manufacturing cost of about $100.",
                "On top of what others already said, I'd add that objects in space move in a very regular motion (line or ellipse) which makes it easier to track the object during capture. On the other hand, you hand trembles in a way unpredictable to your camera, which is why no digital stabilization compensation is possible. ",
                "You're conflating two different technologies. While consumer cameras and cameras on spacecraft fundamentally work the same way, they're designed for entirely different things. You're comparing apples to oranges. It's not that one is better than the other. They're simply not interchangeable.\n\nThat's also even the issue here. What's happening is that the spacecraft is just far away from the object they photograph. Think about when you're on a plane and you look at the window. The ground below appears to be barely moving, despite the fact that you're moving at 600mph. You can whip out your camera and take a perfect picture of the ground below you because it's far away. ",
                " > when my DSLR/phone camera can't even take photos with a decent amount of clarity with small hand vibrations?\n\n >  Why are the image stabilisation technologies in commercial products so dated?\n\nThe brilliant thing NASA did was to make a spacecraft without any hands.  \n\nThe speeds are astronomical, but effective speed varies with distance.  It takes a fast shutter speed to freeze a housefly in flight, but a jet in the sky is easy to photograph.\n\nThe camera on New Horizons is named Ralph, and wit works more like a scanner than a camera.  It uses CCDs, which have been supplanted by CMOS chips in high end cameras.  But it has seven of them, each one is 5024 pixels wide by just 32 tall.  5024 pixels is roughly equivalent to a 16 megapixel camera, but by scanning and stitching, very high resolution is possible.\n\nThe sun is fairly dim out there, but the cold temperature helps achieve low noise at relatively high ISO.  [Amateur astrophotographers sometimes build coolers for their camera sensors.](_URL_0_)  This was especially prevalent around the time when New Horizons was built.  CCD chips build up heat while they capture data, CMOS chips develop less heat.",
                "It's not the research that's the problem. You have a lot of different things at work:\n\n* Size. You can get higher resolution and faster imaging by increasing the size of your sensor field and the amount of sensors on it. You actual light sensor even on a DSLR is probably a lot smaller than the one on New Horizons, and the one in a smart phone is tiny. The same goes for lenses, mirrors and similar, you can get phenomenal detail just by making everything *bigger* because you can gather more light at once.\n\n* Production. This one is twofold, scale and price.\n * Price: You do not only pay to research and develop a product, you need to actually build it. For a space probe, nobody will blink if the camera will cost a million dollars just to build it. But you will not want to pay $1,000,700 instead of $700 because of a camera. Economies of scale cannot make something infinitely cheap, they can primarily spread fixed costs (like research, building the factory, things you pay only once, regardless of how many things you build afterwards) on a lot of products, bringing them close to zero per item built and enabling you to deal with higher fixed costs like research into more efficient factory technology or similar, but besides that you cannot do much with scale to bring down labor, power and material costs.\n * Scale: You cannot produce cutting edge technology at scale. For a space telescope or probe, every little piece can be made with highly specialized equipment by highly specialized people. If it takes half a year to build a part, that's ok. But for consumer products, there better be a few thousand each day or even each hour, because it is a mass market. That means you cannot produce at the one-off quality you do for space probes.\n\n* Environment.\n * On earth, even if you hold your camera perfectly still, you have air in the way. Air with different temperatures, that have different density, and therefore break light a tiny bit (this is what makes heatwaves appear). Small dust particles floating in the air can scatter tiny bits of light. All this means is, in out atmosphere, you never have the perfect situation that every bit of what you photograph has exactly one ray of light impacting exactly one sensor on your camera. Some of that light goes elsewhere, but some other light might be scattered to this sensor from elsewhere too. It's never perfect. But space, space is empty. No air to bend light. Almost no dust to scatter any.\n * Tolerances for space hardware can be insanely tight. You can spend more on just making sure your high tech equipment is delivered to you and launched into space without being damaged than you can spend on a dozen phones or DSLRs. And once actually in space, you have quite constant parameters. Yes, you can have big temperature differences between areas in direct sunlight and in shadow, but there's no shifting humidity. No bumps, no sudden movements anymore. You can create instruments with astonishing precision for space that would not work in consumer technology because your environment is rougher and constantly changing.\n * Disturbances are almost non-existent in space. As others have pointed out, in space objects have very stable movement you can anticipate more or less flawlessly, especially the relative movement, compared to one another. On earth, even if you do not hold it in your hand, there will almost always be some vibration coming even though the ground. It's way to tiny for you to notice while photographing things on this planet, but it would get in he way if you photograph across the distances involved in astronomy.\n\n & nbsp;\n\nAll this together means you cannot afford that quality of equipment as a normal tool, you would not want to lug it around with you, it would be too sensitive for normal work and if you could afford it and could wield it and it wouldn't break, our atmosphere would ruin your shot anyway."

                "Revenge was certainly a part of it. Soviet political officers would put together a 'revenge score' where they'd interview the soldiers in their unit and compile a master list of all they had lost during the war.  After this was done a poster would be put up that said something like \"We are now getting our revenge for 775 of our relatives who were killed, for 909 relatives who were taken away into slavery, for 478 burnt-down houses and for 303 destroyed farms\".  Or, to quote the Soviet writer Ilya Ehrenburg \"Do not count days; do not count miles.  Count only the number of Germans you have killed.  Kill the German - this is your mother's prayer. Kill the German - this is the cry of your Russian earth.  Do not waver. Do not let up. Kill.\".  I'm not aware of anywhere (outside of Nazi propaganda) where Soviet authorities were explicitly calling for the rape of German women, but it's easy to see how the fury they were whipping up to motivate their soldiers to fight could overflow into criminal behavior. \n\nAt the same time it would be impossible to put all of this down to revenge.  There were cases where women in occupied territory were raped by advancing Soviet troops, and even Russian women who had been taken as slave labor and then later raped by their fellow countrymen. None of this makes sense in the context of revenge. \n\nI don't know how it would be possible to give a percentage breakdown of the different causes, but there's obviously multiple different things going on here;\n\nAt the most basic level there are just a certain % of people out there who will commit rape if they can get away with it. A soldier in enemy territory is going around armed and surrounded by potential victims whose only recourse is to try to seek justice from the same organization their rapist is a part of. In terms of sheer opportunity, it doesn't get much 'better' for someone who's already inclined to commit rape.\n\nThe sheer brutality of the war in the east may have contributed somewhat as well, both in terms of the men committing the rapes and in their comrades who were allowing it to happen.  At the same time there have been a huge number of men who have suffered all kinds of war trauma who didn't become rapists.  This should show that war trauma is not an excuse, and is at best only a partial explanation. \n\nCultural factors also certainly play a role.  Rape is a social problem, and the attitudes that the rapist has been inculcated with certainly play a part in his activities.  According to Beevor, looting implicitly meant rape as well in the Red Army.  That idea doesn't make much sense unless you regard women as property, which is obviously a deeply patriarchal notion. With that being said, the idea that the USSR(with its official doctrine of equality a large number of women involved in combat operations) was uniquely patriarchal seems a bit absurd. \n\nIt's also important to note that these different factors aren't mutually exclusive.  A soldier who was committing rapes purely because the opportunity presented itself might justify his behavior to his comrades by calling it an act of revenge.  They might be willing to look the other way because of the effects of previous wartime experiences.  This only makes it more difficult to disentangle what the \"real\" cause of this phenomenon was. \n\nI hope this has been useful to you even if I couldn't provide a definitive answer.  If you have any questions I'll answer them if I feel able. \n\nSources:\n\nBeevor, A. (2003). The fall of Berlin, 1945. New York: Penguin.\n\nLowe, K. (2012). Savage continent: Europe in the aftermath of World War II. London: Viking.",
                "I harbor some doubts towards an explanation that seeks to assign cultural factors major explanatory power. /u/kieslowskifan gives an amazingly in-depth treatment of the Red Army's behavior in East Germany [here](_URL_0_). Next to the factors mentioned here and by /u/ZizeksHobobeard -- revenge mentality, brutalization by war, the prevention of the normalization of the relationship between occupier and occupied, similar occurrences in the other Allied zones --, another reason why I am very hesitant to chalk the Red Army's behavior to cultural factors is the general prevalence of this phenomenon in WWII.\n\nWe often tend to focus on the Red Army when it comes especially to rape. And while this as pointed out in the linked answer above was also a phenomenon that occurred in the Western Allied zone, the focus on sexual crimes of the Red Army among the Allied army is somewhat justified because of the sheer scale of it. What does get overlooked often and why I am hesitant to assign cultural factors major explanatory power is that this phenomenon on the German side is still very underresearched.\n\nWe of course do know about the crimes committed by the Germans in the Soviet Union. However, rape usually has no place in this narrative. This is an incredibly hard subject to research but there are some indications that a similar behavior seems to have been endemic in the German occupied Soviet Union. Pascale R. Bos cites figures in her article *Feminists Interpreting the Politics of Wartime Rape: Berlin, 1945\"; Yugoslavia, 1992–1993 Journal of Women in Culture and Society, 2006, vol. 31, no. 4, p.996-1025*: A German Wehrmacht survey from 1942 estimates that 750,000 babies had already been born from contact between German soldiers and Russian women. This is a conservative estimate and covers only the time frame up to 1942. While not all of these might have come from rape it still shows how endemic the problem must have been.\n\nWendy Jo Gertjejanssen writes in her thesis [Victims, Heroes, Survivors. Sexual Violence on the Eastern Front during World War II](_URL_1_) about the prevalence of violence on the Eastern Front during the German attack on the Soviet Union. She shows that the German military ran hundreds of brothels on the Eastern Front with a still unknown number of women being forced into prostitution through starvation or at gun point. She asserts that in addition to criminal behavior being made official policy with the Barbarosse decree etc., there also was an official policy of sexual exploitation of Soviet women that affected thousands if not hundred thousands.\n\nShe also goes further and writes:\n\n >  Rape by armed men was a reality on the eastern front. Members of the German Army, the SS and police, the Red Army, and armed partisan fighters raped women and girls all over the east, from a wide variety of backgrounds. The leadership of neither military did much to prevent its men from sexually assaulting civilian women and girls. A few men were punished, and there are stories of Soviet officers shooting soldiers who were guilty of rape. The available evidence, however, indicates that these were exceptions. Rape was not viewed as a crime, let alone a brutal attack against a person. Although rape was not a formal military tactic by either army, rape was deployed as a means of terror by both the Germans and the Soviets, and there was a tacit understanding that the armed men had a right or even permission to rape women and girls. The complicity of both the German and the Soviet military leaderships during the war and the denial of governments, states, veterans of war, politicians, and other national and international leaders has been pervasive, unmistakable, and generally, a disgrace.\n\nWhile here too, it is virtually impossible to get definite numbers, Gertjejanssen basically goes to show that sexual violence had been part of the Eastern Front theater basically since the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. And while this, of course, does in no way negate or relaitivize the behavior of the Red Army in Germany, it is a very strong argument against what Norman Naimark argues. If the sexual violence of the Soviet Army was so strongly rooted in culture, why did the Germans behave in a strikingly similar way? I think what this shows is that the issue of sexual violence as an essential part of the fighting on the Eastern Front is a heavily underresearched topic and that we need to be very careful when looking at the Soviet in Germany example and assigning explanations without knowing or considering this background."

As a result, it becomes photosynthetic and never needs to eat again. However, its offspring are not born with the plastids. Plastids need to have their chlorophyll periodically regenerated, which is done by the algae cell itself usually. However, it seems that plastids in elysia are maintained for the slug's lifetime, and the genes for producing the necessary proteins are present in the elysia's nucleus. [This paper](_URL_0_) considers the possible explanations, one of which is that the genes for generating chlorophyll transferred from the algae to the elysia at some point, which would mean it has genes from something outside its kingdom."

                "Alright, Hua Mulan.  In most traditions of the story she was a resident of the state of Northern Wei, the longest-lasting of the Northern Dynasties (386-535CE) of the Northern  &  Southern Period (420-589CE).  There are, of course, other tellings that put her in the Sui/Tang period, and certain others that put her in a nebulous “sometime in ancient and faraway musical *Chiiiiina*”… but most tellings put her in Northern Wei.\n\nThis creates from the outset some very interesting and problematic issues with the Disnified version.  For one, though Mulan and her people are indeed called to serve against invaders, it’s never specified in the *Ballad of Mulan* which invaders they’re talking about, and it *certainly* never talks about “Get[ting] down to business to defeat the Huns/Xiongnü”… because, well, the “Huns” were already there, in Northern Wei… as its emperors, officials, and population.  Northern Wei was a Tuoba xianbei state that had partially sinified itself… but was still viewed by the Southern Han Chinese (of the Liu Song and Southern Qi Dynasties, respectively) as *themselves* the barbarians.  From the *Ballad of Mulan:*\n\n >  昨夜见军帖，可汗大点兵.\n\n >  trans: ““Last night I saw the draft posters, The Khan is calling many troops.\"\n\nFrom later on in the poem, after Mulan and her army has won the war:\n\n >  归来见天子，天子坐明堂。策勋十二转，赏赐百千强。可汗问所欲，木兰不用尚书郎，愿驰千里足，送儿还故乡。\n\n >  trans: “On her return she sees the Son of Heaven, The Son of Heaven sits in the Splendid Hall. He gives out promotions in twelve ranks And prizes of a hundred thousand and more. The Khan asks her what she desires. “Mulan has no use for a minister’s post. I wish to ride a swift mount, To take me back to my home.”\n\nThe Son of Heaven is the Khan, and the Khan is the Son of Heaven.  Flibbity-flibbity-floo.  The fact of the matter is that especially northern Chinese history is far, *far* more of a cultural and ethnic melting pot than quite a few realize, or would care to admit.\n\nSo these invaders could have been the Chinese themselves, or the Tibetans, or Tuyuhun, or the Ruanruan Khannate (which seems a likely choice)… but the one thing they were *not* were the Huns/Xiongnü… because neither existed in any meaningful capacity by this point.  But ah well, I’m getting off topic…\n\nWe can infer quite a bit about the era she lived in and the likely consequences of her actions by the reactions of those around her – both her family, and later on the soldiers she’s come to lead in combat:\n\n > 可汗大点兵。军书十二卷，卷卷有爷名。阿爷无大儿，木兰无长兄。愿为市鞍马，从此替爷征。\n\n > 东市买骏马，西市买鞍鞯，南市买辔头，北市买长鞭。旦辞爷娘去，暮宿黄河边。不闻爷娘唤女声，但闻黄河流水鸣溅溅。旦辞黄河去，暮至黑山头。不闻爷娘唤女声，但闻燕山胡骑鸣啾啾。\n\n > 万里赴戎机，关山度若飞。朔气传金柝，寒光照铁衣。将军百战死，壮士十年归。\n\n >  trans: The Khan is calling many troops. The army list is in twelve scrolls,  On every scroll there’s Father’s name. Father has no grown up son, Mulan has no elder brother. I want to buy a saddle and horse, And serve in the army in Father’s place.”\n\n > In the East Market she buys a spirited horse, In the West Market she buys a saddle, In the South Market she buys a bridle, In the North Market she buys a long whip. At dawn she takes leave of Father and Mother, In the evening camps on the Yellow River’s bank. She doesn’t hear the sound of Father and Mother calling, She only hears the Yellow River’s flowing water cry tsien tsien.\n\n > She goes ten thousand miles on the business of war, She crosses passes and mountains like flying. Northern gusts carry the rattle of army pots, Chilly light shines on iron armor. Generals die in a hundred battles, Stout soldiers return after ten years.\n\nShe's not sneaking off in the middle of the night on a stolen horse with a borrowed saddle.  She says to her parents, \"hey, Dad can't go fight, I'm gonna go buy a horse and go off to war.\"  And her parents don't try to stop her.  Yeah, sure, they're sad and all, but such is life in a time of war.  What they're *not* terribly concerned about is the fact that she's a girl.\n\nBecause the historical Mulan isn't some pale-face beauty (ok, well she *is*, but that's not her only or even most important quality.)  The *Ballad* paints Mulan as more of an Ellen Ripley-esque certifiable badass.  There's no \"I'll Make A Man Out of You\" montage in the poem, because she is beating the snot out of her fellow soldiers from day one.  Even the Khan take note:\n\n >  On her return she sees the Son of Heaven, The Son of Heaven sits in the Splendid Hall. **He gives out promotions in twelve ranks And prizes of a hundred thousand and more. The Khan asks her what she desires.** “Mulan has no use for a minister’s post. I wish to ride a swift mount, To take me back to my home.”\n\nMoreover, there's no mid-war gender-reveal.  Instead, she reveals she \"he's\" been a \"she\" these past 12 year only after the war, and voluntarily to her brothers-in-arms:\n\n >  脱我战时袍，著我旧时裳。当窗理云鬓，对镜帖花黄。出门看火伴，火伴皆惊忙：同行十二年，不知木兰是女郎。\n\n > 雄兔脚扑朔，雌兔眼迷离；双兔傍地走，安能辨我是雄雌？\n\n > “I open the door to my east chamber, I sit on my couch in the west room, I take off my war time gown, and put on my old time clothes.” Facing the window she fixes her cloud like hair, Hanging up a mirror she dabs on yellow flower powder. She goes out the door and sees her comrades. Her comrades are all amazed and perplexed. Traveling together for twelve years They didn’t know Mulan was a girl.\n \n > “The he hare’s feet go hop and skip, The she hare’s eyes are muddled and fuddled. Two hares running side by side close to the ground, How can they tell if I am he or she?\"\n\nHer comrades are all sorts of \"amazed and perplexed\" that this ultimate badass was a smokin' hottie the whole time, yes, but she obviously believes that there's no danger in letting them know.  No punitive action is going to be taken against her... certainly nothing like Shen threatening her at swordpoint for the crime of saving his live while having gross girl-germs.\n\nThis hearkens back to the fact that Northern Wei, for all it desperately wanted to be, was *not* totally culturally Chinese... it still had many of the social and gender norms inherited from the Asian steppes and their formerly nomadic traditions - traditions like boys *and* girls should be trained to fight and defend their home, they should *all* be capable with the horse, bow, and sword... and that it was not entirely unheard of for men and women to serve alongside one another.  \n\nMoreover, Mulan in all her tellings serves as a paragon of the Chinese Virtue Above All Other Virtues: *filial piety.*  Sure, she's a girl, but her dad has no grown sons, and he can't effectively serve his lord... she she helps him by serving the khan on his behalf.  That is hardly something to be punished in Chinese value systems.\n\n________\n\nThis does change - as does the story itself - if it moves to a different time period.  Chu Renhou's *The Sui Tang Romance* moves the tale of Mulan up in time to the Tang overthrow of the Sui, ca. 618 CE.  moreover, it was written in the Qing Dynasty of the late 17th century.  Now, Chu borrowed *heavily* (and copied verbatim in more than a few places) from the earlier (pub. 1633) *Forgotten Tales of the Sui Dynasty*.  Nevertheless, it is very *very* focused on the idea of suicide or ritual defacement to establish its female characters with virtue and honor equal to men.  Thus, in the tale of Hua Mulan, we first get a twist of her being found out, but by the *warrior-princess* Dou Xianniang, who tries to recruit Mulan as a man, but then pledges to keep her secret and becomes sworn sisters.  But by the end of the tale, Xianniang's father is captured by the soon-to-be-Emperor Taizong of Tang, and they surrender themselves to suffer his punishment in his stead.  Taizong sees this as a supreme act of filial piety and (in the book) commute the death sentence of Dou Jiande (in reality, no, Dou was executed), and Mulan sent home to relocate her parents.  Harsh reality sets in, however, when she discovers that her father has died, and her mother remarried.  Worse comes to worst when Taizong's ally the Göktürk Khan summons her to his capital to become one of his concubines... at which point she decides to commit suicide rather than suffer such a fate.  From Martin W. Huang:\n\n >  Her suicide is particularly baffling since at the time she is not in love or engaged with anyone and since she is only half-Chinese (her father Turkish, but her mother is Chinese).  Hegel provides the possible explanation that this is intended to be a loyalist message: “even a half-Chinese woman would prefer death by her own hand to serving a foreign ruler.”  Also worth mentioning here is Mulan’s  explanation for why she has masqueraded as a man to join the military: “Feeling ashamed that there were not many loyal subjects and filial sons among men, I decided to take the risk to dress myself as a man.”  Here Mulan is apparently blaming the incompetence of men as one of the reasons that she felt compelled to join the military.  In other words, there would have been no need for her to do so if men had been competent enough to fulfill their duties.\n\nYet even in this telling where her femaleness does result in tragedy, it's again not the emperor or a military officer threatening to cut her down for her womanhood... indeed, though Taizong was prepared to have her and Xianniang executed, that was *because they were captured enemy combatants*, not because they were women. (Hell, Taizong's own sister, Princess Pingyang, was leading her own anti-Sui \"Women Peasant Army\" at this same time... and I should note that the Tang rulers were themselves semi-Turkic). Rather, the issue is having her fate taken out of her own hands as a result: going from being a respected army officer, to being the concubine of a foreign lord."

                "Let's start with a general introduction to the South African apartheid state of 1948-1991 which generated the name for an 'apartheid' system. If you have the time, you can take a look at Worden's excellent introduction to the general history of the country and its political system. \n\nBroadly, the colony that would become the independent state of South Africa had a preexisting racial hierarchy based primarily on land ownership (and therefore economic power in an agrarian society). This skips over a significant chunk of the political interplay between the various colonial parts that would come together into South Africa. However, in order to maintain this power post independence, the white minority constructed a legal framework for \"separateness\" between the constituent races of country (White, Black, 'Mixed', and Indian). These laws and the culture enforced by them resulted in some very specific things that stand out: massive involuntary relocation of majority populations; the creation of defacto 'states' for the unwanted majority to stay in; and the systematic creation of a narrative regarding the history of the country to justify these moves. \n\nThe reason why I drew these three things out is because they serve as *key* points of comparison to look at the United States in the post Civil-War era. I'm relying heavily on the below text by Lassiter (which I've read most recently). There are plenty of sources that cover this material and even your question including Kushner's work.  On the first point, while there was a significant amount of population movement in the US (particularly post 1910 - The Great Migration), it would be a reach to call this intentional and organized relocation of populations by the federal state. On the second point, there is no case where the US, or any of its constituent states created a fictional legal framework of sub-states or territories to corral and otherwise contain African Americans to a specific geographical area. On the third point; there was the creation of a myth to justify the history of the South, slavery and its role in the Civil War (e.g. \"State's Rights\") and the follow on Jim Crow-era petty segregation laws.\n\nSo, yes, there were a significant number of similarities between the two regimes. Petty apartheid laws were abundant; clear cultural distinctions were made between groups based solely on skin color; a narrative was constructed to justify these acts. On the other hand, the scale and scope of the legal actions taken by the minority white community on the majority black community were different and guided by the geographical reality and history of each country. In some ways, due to the preeminence of the US Federal Government and its dilution by Northern/Western states means that the apartheid structure in the US was vastly less centralized, much less systematic and much less obvious than in South Africa. \n\nSourcing:\n\n\n > Kushner, James A.

                "I have to begin by pointing out that the evidence for Heraclius changing the official language of the empire is minimal, as it is dependent on one of Heraclius' edict in 629, which included in his titulature this important phrase 'πιστὸς ἐν Χριστῷ βασιλεύς' (transliteration: 'pistos en Christo basileus') - 'emperor, faithful in Christ'. The gist of the argument is this: previously, official documents were written in Latin and Greek sources would have used 'autokrator' to refer to the emperor, the Greek translation of the Latin 'imperator' (a relic of the Romans' aversion to anything monarchical). 'Basileus', however, definitely had a royal connotation and is previously only used to refer to 'barbarian' kings and the emperor of Persia. As a result, when Heraclius referred to himself as a 'basileus', this was viewed as an important turning-point, as the use of this Greek word can be seen as an indication of a change in the official language of state and a wider cultural shift within the Roman state.\n\nUnfortunately, I don't think this argument, originating in Ostrogorsky's *Geschichte des byzantinischen Staates* (1940), stands up to scrutiny today. For one thing, we know that Greek was already used within the imperial bureaucracy, perhaps as early as the fifth century under Theodosius II, as a praetorian prefect then allegedly issued laws in Greek. Nor was this a unique occurrence. From Christopher Kelly's excellent *Ruling the Later Roman Empire* (2004):\n\n >  In 397 the emperors Arcadius\n >  and Honorius had allowed provincial governors to issue their judgments\n >  in Greek. In September 439, Theodosius II confirmed the validity\n >  of wills written by Roman citizens in Greek. By the turn of the\n >  fourth century, Latin was no longer the language of instruction at the\n >  empire’s most prestigious law schools in Constantinople and Berytus\n >  (modern Beirut). Legal textbooks and commentaries were written in\n >  Greek. From the mid-530s on, most of Justinian’s legislation (unless\n >  specifically directed at the Latin-speaking West) was promulgated in\n >  Greek. His law of 535 ratifying the mid-fifth-century emperor Leo’s\n >  regulations on the alienation of property by religious foundations set\n >  out the advantages of this change simply and clearly. “We decree that\n >  this law [of Leo] shall be valid in all these matters, and we confirm it.\n >  And for this reason we have promulgated and caused it to be written\n >  not in the language of our ancestors but in everyday speech, that is, in\n >  Greek, so that through ease of understanding it might become known\n >  to all.”\n\nMore evidence can be found in the sixth century. John Lydus, a bureaucrat working in Constantinople, complained bitterly that less and less officials were learning Latin - for him, knowledge of Latin was an essential part of being Roman. His contemporary, Procopius, also noted that (albeit in a text written to diminish Justinian):\n\n >  He [Justinian] then appointed Junilus (a Libyan by birth) [as the quaestor], a man who had not so much as a hearsay knowledge of law, for he had not even studied it in the public schools. Although he had a knowledge of Latin, he had never had any tuition in Greek, and was unable to speak the language. Frequently, when he attempted to say a few words in Greek, he was laughed at by his own servants.\n\nIn both cases, it is clear that the use of Latin was nowhere near universal within the upper echelons of power. Of course, this did not mean that Greek was now the official language, since Latin was evidently still being used, most dramatically in Heraclius' silver coinage, which featured the Latin phrase 'Deus adiuta Romanis' - 'God, help the Romans!'.\n\nAs a result, I don't think we can definitely say that Heraclius changed the language of state during his reign - at most, he was making official informal trends. As /u/Growlinghamster pointed out [in this thread](_URL_0_), 'the use of the title “Basileus” wasn’t some radical, out of left field change that Heraclius just sprang on his unsuspecting subjects'. The same, I think, was true for the usage of Greek - we simply don't have any evidence that any emperor had deliberately changed the 'official' language (especially since the empire still possessed territories in the Latin West). To prove this, we would probably need a surviving legal text or an extensive discussion of the edict in a historical source, none of which exist to my knowledge. It is better, I think, to view the changing prominence of Latin and Greek within the Roman Empire as a gradual thing, rather than a sudden transition, since this interpretation fits better with the evidence we do have."

                "Yes indeed the US has commissioned Privateers by Letters of Marque on two main occasions.\n\nThe first was the Quasi War with France in the Caribbean in 1798-1800. However the relatively restricted in time, space, and scale of that conflict meant that only a few score really got into the action.\n\nThe far larger case was the War of 1812 when several hundred vessels of all sizes were commissioned. They sailed from every port from Maine to Georgia, and were instrumental in capturing the majority of the 1,500 or so British vessels taken during the war. And though by 1814 the British bloackade of the American Coast had become sufficiently strong to greatly reduce their numbers and freedom of movement, Privateers never stopped putting to sea completley and still made their mark. By taking prizes they could also impact the British war effort, forcing the diversion of ships for convoy duty and escort, driving up insurance rates in Britain, and diverting other resources. For instance one of the main reasons that Baltimore became the second target of the joint Army-Navy force under Ross, Cochrane, and Cockburn after they burned Washington, was the large  number of Privateers based out of Baltimore. \n\nIn the end somewhere upwards of 500 vessels were used as Privateers, each with a commission from President Madison after Congress delegated to him the authority to issue them early in the conflict. Most were very much on the smaller side though, between 100 and 300 tons displacement and no more than 12-14 guns with lighter armed and smaller ships aplenty. Meanwhile regular naval ships were generally much bigger, the modest sloop USS Wasp was 450 tons for instance and the big 44 gun super frigates Constitution, President, and United States all weighed in around 1,500!\n\nSeveral could be rather bold and certainly many became quite happy with their profits derived from captured ships and good. Thomas Boyle, even notably proclaimed the entirety of the British Isles to be under blockade in a tongue in cheek response to the British blockade of the US which took quite some time to go from being in name only to actually effective. \n\nBut with the end of the war that marked the real end of American Privateers. Lack of any vastly superior maritime foe to defeat was part of it, and by the last decade of the 19th century the practice itself had fallen out of favor internationally while the US Navy was growing into a force that was large enough to both project power abroad and protect the sea lanes of communication. \n\nIt should be noted many were issued by the Confederate Government though their validity was of course challenged by the US and they experienced uneven recognition in European ports and courts. Something that was true of the Confederate Naval war effort in general. ",
                "[](/flufflepirate)The US issued Letters of Marque during the Quasi-War and the War of 1812. The Confederacy issued some during the Civil War.\n\nThe Quasi-War was an undeclared naval conflict between France and the US from 1798 to 1800. The US signed an alliance with France during the revolutionary war, including a mutual defense pact. However, the French monarchy was overthrown, and the US didn't want to be dragged into the subsequent British/French war. The US signed the [Jay Treaty](_URL_7_) with Britain, affirming neutrality with the conflict. France didn't particularly like this state of affairs, and they sent privateers to prey on American shipping heading to Britain. The US tried to build up it's navy with the [Naval Act of 1794](_URL_2_), but the US was far behind their French rivals. The US returned the favor by commissioning [1,000 privateers to attack French ships](_URL_5_).\n\nDuring the War of 1812, the US navy was still pretty pathetic. President James Madison issued Letters of Marques during the war to attack British shipping to help supplement the US's meager fleet. Here is the letter issued to Captain Million: _URL_4_\n\nIn 1856, most of the great powers of Europe signed the [Treaty of Paris](_URL_0_), which banned Letters of Marque. The US didn't that document. However, during the Civil War, Lincoln wanted to keep the European powers out of the war, and refused to issue letters of Marque to comply with the Treaty of Paris. The Confederacy didn't oblige the treaty and [issued Letters of Marque to attack American vessels](_URL_1_).\n\nSince the Civil War, the US hasn't issued Letters of Marque. There is a legend that the Goodyear blimp had one during WW2, although [that story been debunked](_URL_3_). There was a recent small attempt to bring the Letters of Marque back. In 2007, Ron Paul introduced a [bill into Congress that would allow the President to issue letters of Marque to take the property of Al Qaeda.](_URL_6_) However, so far attempts of revival have not stuck."

                "If there was a way to absolutely control how your body responded to certain compounds, poisons wouldn't work. Your body just handles what it can in a predetermined fashion, and dumps out the remainder. ",
                "Molecules are much more than just what atoms they are composed of. Each molecule also has a specific shape and properties (like, it's electrically charged in one area, or acidic in one area, etc).   \n\n\nAt the most basic level, your body is really just a bunch of chemical reactions occurring in very tightly controlled environments separated my membranes (whether they are cell membranes or even small compartments inside of cells called organelles). The body doesn't \"think\" about what to do when it encounters a particular molecule. Whatever chemical reactions will happen in that environment will just happen. \n\n & #x200B;\n\nThey way many reactions in your body happen is through enzymes--these are little molecular machines usually made of protein that help chemical reactions develop in a certain way. If you throw A into it, it will give you B and if your throw Y into it, it may give you Z. But it won't do anything when it encounters C, because it's the wrong size or D because the shape is wrong, or E because it's got the wrong electrical charges, etc.  \n\n\nSo when it comes to Aspirin, it doesn't shut down the nervous system. Aspirin binds to an enzyme (a molecular machine) called COX and prevents COX from doing its job. Normally, COX produces a bunch of molecules that do things like cause inflammation (so aspirin can reduce swelling, fevers, etc) and molecules that cause your nerves to send pain signals (so you experience less pain). However, some of these molecules also affect your blood's ability to clot (so aspirin can increase bleeding to a degree), and other molecules are involved in the production of mucous in your stomach, which helps protect it from stomach acid (so aspirin can also lead to stomach ulcers in some people).  \n\n\nYour cells' environment is very important to all of this. For a much more advanced example, let's say you've been fasting for a while and your cells are set up to break down your stored energy to make sugar. Then you eat a bunch of rice.  In your digestive system, the rice molecules are broken down into sugars by enzymes that break down sugars (different ones break down proteins and fats). The sugars then bind to enzymes on the walls of your intestine and allow the sugar to get absorbed into these cells and ejected into your bloodstream. The high levels of sugar in your blood cause them to bind to other enzymes and tell them to release hormones like insulin into your blood. Insulin then travels around your body and binds to other enzymes turning them ON. These enzymes then start producing molecules in your cells that turn ON other enzymes. \\*Those\\* enzymes then bind to \\*other\\* enzymes and turn \\*them\\* ON as well.   \n\n\nNow that the right group of enzymes has been turned ON, when they encounter sugar molecules they will join them together so they can be stored as long chains of sugars called starches which can be used for energy later on. When the levels of sugar in your blood fall, you stop making the hormones that call all of this to happen and they turn off. At the same time, other hormones are released that activate another set of enzymes that will now break down these starches back to form sugars which your cells can use for energy. (The reality is a little more complex--in many cases, an enzyme that takes A and makes B, can also take B and make A. It's the overall environment of the cell at the time that dictates which direction the chemical reaction goes).  \n\n\n  \n"

                "You're asking an \"ought\" question, so it's important to know what the criteria are for that \"ought\" (or whether \"religion aside\" is even possible). A lot of considerations functioned in the Church's decisions about the canon through successive assemblies. However, we can say at minimum that the Church expected the texts it selected to accurately reflect apostolic teaching, which it deemed inspired and authoritative.\n\nThis is something the historian may be in a position to say something about. However, the subject is controversial, and experts are far from unanimous. And even this criterion, which dates to the 2nd century, gets muddy.\n\nFor example, what counted as \"apostolic teaching\"? Many of the Gnostic schools claimed access to \"secret\" apostolic testimonies. The 2nd-century heretic Marcion believed only Paul faithfully conveyed the gospel of Christ; the others went astray. Hence Marcion's canon included only a purged version of Luke's gospel plus ten \"authentic\" Pauline epistles: Galatians, 1 and 2 Corinthians, Romans, 1 and 2 Thessalonians, Ephesians, Colossians, Philippians, and Philemon. However, by \"apostolic teaching,\" most of the Church Fathers meant teaching in line with the \"[rule of faith](_URL_0_)\" delivered in oral and written form by the original apostles, six in particular: Matthew, Peter, Paul, John, James, and Jude. And unlike Marcion, most were not in a hurry to figure out exactly which books counted or did not, which is why our complete list of canonical NT books doesn't appear until a letter of Athanasius in 367. For centuries after Christ, different communities used slightly different sets of books as scripture (that is, for reading during services). The term \"canon\" itself did not appear until the fourth century.\n\nDespite that fuzziness, some broad statements can be made. The synoptic gospels and the major Pauline epistles were universally accepted \"except among the more extreme proponents of Jewish Christianity\" (Ackroyd and Evans). These formed the \"core\" of the early Church's scripture, and even fringe groups such as the gnostics made use of them. The rest of the canonical NT was used some places, but was unknown or not recognized in others until a certain point.\n\nWhat do today's historians say about these texts? Well, every one of them has been questioned, and textual criticism suggests a larger group of writers were involved in their creation than tradition has passed down. The four gospels, especially Mark and Matthew, are very old, and probably do represent original apostolic teachings. Luke and Acts were less privileged until the second century, when they became very important for a heresy-embattled Church. Paul probably wrote the epistles attributed to him, except for the Pastorals (Timothy and Titus), with Ephesians, Colossians, and 2 Thessalonians being divisive among scholars. Who wrote these, if not Paul? Colossians, Thessalonians, and Ephesians were written, if not by Paul, by devoted followers. Who wrote the Pastoral Epistles is an open question.\n\nWhat about the other epistles in the New Testament, which it appears some early Christian communities used and others did not? 1 Peter was widely received early on as being authentically Petrine. 2 Peter and Jude were widely accepted by the end of the 2nd century. Hebrews was attributed to Paul by some in the early Church, but nobody accepts that now; nevertheless, it holds an important place in the canon. The origin of James is highly controversial, with some scholars claiming it was not even authored by a Christian; it was one of the last books to receive recognition from the Church.\n\nHowever, in all this I have left out the \"Johannine\" writings: the gospel, epistles, and apocalypse all attributed to St John. These books and their relationship to one another are disputed, but many would suggest they are products of a \"school\" that has its roots in their reputed author, John the Apostle. The Gospel of John and 1 John were accepted earliest; at the other end, Revelation was one of a number of Christian apocalypses circulating in the early Church, distinguishing itself perhaps most by its compelling literary construction and compatibility with the rest of the New Testament.\n\nIn short, regarding the canonical texts of the NT, there's a spectrum of plausibility as to which authentically stem from the hand or teaching of a recognized Apostle, and few clear answers. I don't have time at the moment to say anything about other books that claimed scriptural status in the early church; I'll come back to that later, or leave it to someone else.\n\n**Sources**\n\nBruce Metzger, *The Canon of the New Testament*\n\nP.

                "The term was made up to describe a problem with trying to negotiate with a country that has an elected legislature and high turnover -- I believe the original example was Turkey, in the earliest years of their democracy. Who do you even call to negotiate *with,* when whoever you call might not even be there two years later?\n\nThe answer? The bureaucracy. All of the mid-level management who stay in the same jobs in the foreign ministry, the defense department, and so on even when the legislature changes hands, the people who work one level down from the political appointees. And because they're below the \"surface\" of the democracy, they defined them as the \"deep\" state, as opposed to the \"surface\" or elected state. *In its original usage, it wasn't necessarily sinister.*\n\nBut it rapidly came to be interpreted in sinister ways, because narrow interest groups have always complained that when their coalition or party gets elected, having promised them the moon and the stars, they do not get the moon and the stars. And sometimes it is, in fact, because elected politicians went to the department of whatever and the department of whatever said, \"we physically, literally cannot give them the moon and the stars\" or \"it's illegal for us to give them the moon and the stars\" or \"we can, but it'll cost a billion trillion dollars and take a hundred years.\" And usually, if they say that, it's because it's true. But whether it's true or not, the politician then goes back to his voters and says, \"I promised you the moon and the stars, and having voted for it and won, you deserve the moon and the stars, but I was stopped from giving them to you by those unelected 'elites' in 'the Deep State.'\"",
                "As stated already, it's typically used to refer to some sort of shadowy secretive cabal that operates outside of public view that controls the policy directions of the visible government.\n\nWhether this is actually the case in the U.S. and to what degree can't really be said. But I think it's important to understand that an actual 'Deep State' needn't be visualized as defined above. It is quite possible for the un-elected officials (bureaucrats) that outlast elected governments to function as a 'Deep State' without explicitly meaning to. Especially those involved in foreign policy decisions, as decisions made in this sphere typically have consequences that will span the multiple terms of different elected governments.\n\nThere was a bit in the JRE podcast interview with Edward Snowden that I think is pretty relevant:\n\n[_URL_0_](_URL_0_)",
                "Deep state in a nutshell refers to bureaucrats and lifelong unelected officials in government that are not subject to being removed by voters and push government policies and practices in the directions that they want.",

By this I mean they have their own political views, but these are not discussed at work, and they do the work of the state, answering to the government of the day. They work through various administrations, but generally this doesn’t impact the overall mission or day-to-day. Pentagon, FBI, CIA etc. Trump has used this term because he is annoyed he can’t fire people who aren’t director-level political appointees, and feels these organisations are against him. In actual fact these people are often patriots who could be earning more outside, and who work for the best interests of the country as signed for as part of their job. \n\nTLDR - Trump thinks he should be able to control every aspect of the various apparatus of government, like a dictator could in Russia or China. He can’t, by design, so he made it sound conspiratorial and blames it for the checks and balances blocking him from doing stupid/illegal stuff.",

If they don’t like the party in power, they can get rid of them easily. The PM can be killed like Benazir Bhutto and her father or they can undergo kangaroo court corruption charges, like Gilani and Sharif. So the country is effectively ruled by an unelected and unaccountable deep state. Demagogues use the term to malign anyone in civil or administrative service in the government.

Those folks just have to bear the brunt of being associated with (((THEM)))\n\nWhat they mean is the secret cabal of nefarious individuals who actually pulled the strings of government. America seems to have this weird thing where we always think there's some sort of cabal of individuals controlling everything. The current term tends to be deep state, international bankers, Soros, or any variation on the three. They are all variations on the Jewish global conspiracy.

If a deep State did exist, it would likely be made up of a small group of highly ranked employees who could subvert or influence policy decisions without the public's knowledge.",

The founding fathers were quite aware of people like Trump and his ilk and set up a constitution that would stop much of what they are trying to do. Still, we, the People, must be more vigilant in supporting this work through voting, running for office and doing more civil service.",

                "The crime of treason under Roman law was known as _maiestas populi Romani minuta_ (the diminution of the majesty of the Roman people).  Prosecution generally involved three investigative sessions which included the presentation of evidence and arguments on both sides.  This was followed by a final session where a military tribunal (_comitia centuriatia_) reached a verdict.\n\nThis information is drawn from [_The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome, Vol. 1_](_URL_0_).  The article is available on Google Books and has this to say about the application of the charge:\n\n >  The charge seems to have been deliberately left without close definition, but it was applied to those who obstructed or used violence in popular assemblies and to those who failed as commanders (333).\n\nThe entry mentions, though, that the definition alters slightly over time.  As this isn't my specialty, you might want to message /u/Tiako.",
                "The main problem in Rome was the 'who', not the 'why', if you like. It was widely acknowledged that Roman citizens could be executed (imprisonment was a very rare punishment in Rome), but many maintained that they could only be sentenced to death by a court run by a tribune. However, you can look at examples such as the execution of the Catilinarian conspirators in 63 to explore your question more clearly.\n\nL. Sergius Catilina had, according to Cicero (who was a consul for 63), been plotting against the state along with a group of others, such as Lentulus (a senior senator) and Cegethus. In his First Catilinarian oration, Cicero urges Catiline to leave Rome and take his co-conspirators with him. Catiline did leave (though he left many of his fellows behind), joined a rebel band, and so was clearly an enemy of the state. Cicero's co-consul, Antonius, was sent with an army to deal with him. There were no survivors.\n\nHowever, Cicero still faced the problem of the conspirators left in Rome, and his Catilinarian orations 2-4 try to portray them as *hostes* (enemies in war). He sets himself up as a *dux togatus* (toga'd/civilian captain), and with this purely rhetorical framework persuades the Senate to hold a \"trial\" of Lentulus etc. (as narrated in the Third Catilinarian). In the Fourth Catilinarian, Cicero is summing up in the Senate (probably - the source is complex), and he reasons that because these civilian conspirators are plotting against the state, they are *hostes*, and so not citizens, and the Senate can execute them without reference to the courts. He bases this on a *senatus consultum ultimum* ('Final Decree/Decision of the Senate'), passed a month earlier, that instructed the consuls 'to see to it that the Republic should suffer no harm'. However, it was on the basis of this action (though actually for political reasons) that Cicero was exiled in 58 under the *lex Clodia*, and many of his speeches subsequent to (and during) 63 can be seen as partly aimed at reminding people that he saved the Republic by \"the only means necessary\".\n\nThere are a couple of other similar examples, such as the earlier clubbing to death of Gaius Gracchus, and all revolve around the definition of citizens and senatorial power. I know that wasn't exactly the focus of your question, but if we make it active 'what did *x* consider treason during the Roman era' (and I talk only of the Republic) , we need to supply who does the considering, which in many cases gives you the answer for which you asked.\n\nIf you're interested in Roman laws, have a look here:\n_URL_0_\n\nOr, if you can read Latin/Greek:\n_URL_1_\n\nYou could also try Lintott's classic book, *The Constitution of the Roman Republic*, which has a good chapter on the *senatus consultum ultimum*, and a helpful bibliography.\n\n(Sorry that's a bit long.)",
                "Actually, patricide also carried the death penalty. Killing your father, the man who gave you life, was considered as bad as treason if not worse.\n\nThe traditional penalty was [*culleus parricidae*:](_URL_0_) to be stripped in public, have all one's skin whipped off, and be put in a sack (culleus) together with a dog, a cock, and a monkey, which would then be thrown into the sea. Or, for practicality, one might simply be butchered or devoured in the arena.\n\nThis was famously at stake in Cicero's first major trial, the defense of Sextus Roscius in 80 BC. [Recommended](_URL_1_) (though the Moroccan extras don't really look all that Roman).\n",

The accepted punishment was to entomb them alive because it was forbidden to spill their blood.",
                "During the life of the Roman Republic, capital punishment was performed more often and for a wider array of different crimes. If a public servant, most notably a judge, was caught accepting a bride, he would have his nose cut off and then he would be stuffed into a large bad with a rabid or aggressive animal. The bag was sewn shut and then thrown into a running river. Lying under oath was also punishable by capital punishment. The Romans considered the integrity of their legal system to be the fountain from which all other institutions of the state and society drew their life-blood from. Not surprisingly, to violate the court's integrity, and thereby threaten the state's health, perjurers were thrown from a cliff, the Tarpeian Rock, to their deaths. "

                "I worked for an arena that is about 60 years old. It is a wooden dome structure. After 60 years of concerts, sporting events and just about everything else they discovered that many of nuts that had worked loose, the bolts themselves hadn't moved much if at all. Just the nuts meant to keep them from moving came loose. They are massive too probably weighing around 16oz a piece and there was several thousand of them. Luckily none had come all they way off. From the roof to the floor was about 60 feet.",
                "Generally speaking, not a problem. What does have to be considered is the potential for dynamic loading being higher than the static loading. In places where there is likely to be music, everyone dancing/jumping at the same time means that the design load should be increased. For some specific numbers, the Australian code (AS/NZS 1170.1) gives 1.5kPa for a typical household area, and 5.0kPa for a dance halls and studios.\n\nThe dynamic frequency of the structure should be considered, but that's more so that the floor doesn't feel exceptionally \"springy\" underneath. You don't want people to be able to feel the vibrations when they step, because it's somewhat disconcerting. My uni had a walkway specifically designed to have this vibration \"feel\" as an example of why there needs to be sufficient internal damping. This is normally only an issue for steel frame structures, but over given spans can be an issue for concrete/timber as well.",
                "Its usually not an issue. I work at a company that makes loudspeakers for all sorts of applications. We have a room we use for reliability testing. This room is quite small and we rest loudspeakers that go into stadiums and are designed to throw hundreds of feet away. We push these systems past there limits and then run them like that for weeks on end. The only structural issues we have had is in the panels we use for the connections going on and out of the room. There have been some issues of the connectors becoming loose but that’s it. We even have some small racks for cables screwed into the wall that have been fine. To be fair this room was designed for this application. But we are talking many many thousands of hours, and in a room that’s small so the energy doesn’t spread out much. It’s worst case scenario in there. And the amount of energy we put into the room would take several decades to get to In a normal venue. And the importance on the size of the room can’t be overstated. Take car audio for example. There are lots of car audio competitions and people posting videos of them blowing out the glass or a girls hair flying all over the place in a car. But that is completely different than a concert venue. In a car it is such a small space that your acoustically coupled to a resonant chamber. This allows for a lot more pressure because it has no where to go. \n\nAll that being said who knows. If a structure happens to have the right resonant frequency it’s definitely feasible that he PA causes damage. \n\nFor example the millennium bridge in London had an issue where the resonance  of the structure was the same as the average pace of a person walking. They initially had to close the bridge down because it would shake so badly people couldn’t walk on it. They solved this by hanging weights under neath the bridge and tuned the weight and distance they hung them at so their resonant frequency would cancel out that if the people waking. ",

The music caused the filling to be detached from the steel framework and in danger of collapse."

                "I can talk a little bit about this! English is my second language, so forgive any errors. I can mainly speak for the socio-cultural part.\n\nIn Roger Worth's 'On the South-Americas', and in 'Walking Ghosts' by Steven Dudley, the issue of violence in Colombia (from last centuries '40s up until the date of writing the respective books) stands central.\n\nThe bottomline he arrives at, is that first and foremost is geography, which may sound overly simplistic and far-fatched. But historically speaking, Colombia’s vast, difficult geography has made it extremely challenging for the central government in Bogota to extend control over its territory. This meant that well into the 20th century, the nation was more like a string of loosely associated villages than an integrated community with a strong sense of national identity. Regional and family loyalties trounced all. This means that loyalty to a nation, as we in the West would know it, is not as normal or as expected as it would be here. Great distrust exists against the government which is only worsened by the image of government officials being corrupted, or needing some sort of monetary compensation to fulfill otherwise 'normal' duties.\n\nThe second reason why violence remains a fundamental part of Colombian life is the legacy of the “La Violencia.” 200,000 people died in a totally pointless conflict between the Liberals and the Conservatives (one is reminded of the scene in “One Hundred Years of Solitude” in which Colonel Aureliano Buendia observes the main difference between the two parties is that the Liberals go the mass at five o´clock and the Conservatives at eight). “La Violencia” is a historical trauma that the country still has not properly dealt with. Thousands were displaced and migrated to cities, where hopelessness and lack of opportunity created a vicious cycle of gangs and crime. Campesinos also migrated to other rural areas even further away from state control. The power vacuum left after “La Violencia” allowed groups like the FARC and the ELN to rise to power. Ever since the 1940s you would be hard-pressed to find a Colombian who doesn’t have a family member who was killed, injured or traumatized. There is no doubt that the effects of “La Violencia” have created the social and political reality that Colombians live in today, even though thanks to the “politics of anesthesia,” such a historical trauma is barely present in the public consciousness.\n\nThe third reason for Colombia’s violence-ridden nature is that informal behavioral norms in Colombia encourage corruption and crime. There is a huge gap between what Colombia’s constitution and lawmakers pronounce, and the way that laws are actually enforced in practice. For the young men who make up the military and police force, this distinction between what is legal and what is culturally acceptable creates situations wherein it is more rewarding to break the law than follow it. In part, you could say that the reason why in Colombia there is such ambivalence towards following legal norms is because for a long time, legal norms were imposed from above by a small group of social and political elites, without much care in enforcing them and without much input from the marginalized majority. Why then should the majority of the population respect the laws formally endorsed by the state? This still echoes throughout society today, combined with a close feeling of 'community' over 'state', that very much paved the way for the issues Colombia still faces today.\n\n\n\n"

When that occurs in pregnant women whose fetuses are still developing, it can simply stop certain developments from happening. This causes things like low bone density, malformed bones, lack of eyes or limbs, underdeveloped brains.\n\nIt's not just Southeast Asia that suffers from it many births in the USA have been affected by the chemicals because soldiers that were caught in the sprays have the poison in their bodies and passed it to their spouses via semen and caused defective births.",

If the incidence of deformity is the same in two populations, a small population with a small birth rate may have 1 case per year, where as a large population with a large birth rate may have 10 per year.\n\n**Prenatal Care** :\nIn western countries prenatal care is routine. Prenatal vitamins: Folic acid decreases the incidence of neural tube defects, as part of prenatal care. Women have routine ultrasounds to look for anomalies / birth defects. If the defect is not correctable, termination of pregnancy is an option.\nMany women in 3rd world countries have little or no access to health care, and the deliveries occur at home.\n\n**Genetic**: Asians have higher incidence of Cleft lip.\n\n**Infectious**: In western countries all children are given Rubella vaccine as part of MMR, and are immune to rubella. (except for children of anti-vaccers). In developed countries women that get the Rubella infection for the first time during pregnancy can have children with (deafness, blindness, heart defects, microcephaly).\nNo prenatal care also means women are also not treated/screened for vertically transmitted infections (TORCH).\n\n**Post Natal Care**:\nBirth defects in western countries are treated early so the prevalence is lower.\nIn the 3rd World, the birth defects are not corrected due to expenses of surgery. So there are more babies/children in the population that have defects.\n\n**Environmental / Food Regulation**\nWestern countries have more regulations, and regular monitoring of environmental pollutants. USA has FDA, and EPA. The air in China and India is filled with pollution. No regulation of Milk mean many cases of E. coli, and Tuberculosis.

                "I suspect you might have a hard time finding out exactly the answer you're searching for, for a number of reasons. Bio-inspired flight, and in general a detailed analysis of the aerodynamics of flying animals is a relatively recent research topic. I work in it rather indirectly; I can give you some general conversation, but not much for direct answers. Aerodynamics researchers typically aren't looking at the effects of individual feathers, but rather look at the general planform shape. Determining the effects of that single feather would be very difficult from an experimental point of view; I can simulate a rigid wing of that shape with and without that feather and tell you something, but when birds spread these outer feathers it tends to be in maneuvering and landing, where the airflow becomes very unsteady, and the feathers are anything but rigid. You can't just stick a bird in a wind tunnel and perform any kind of reliable experiment.\n\n\nIf I had to give an educated guess about the potential use of that feather based on the schematic given, I can think of a few reasons.  At high angles, a wing planform like that (without the feathers spread out) will stall on the outboard section before it will stall on the inboard.  You don't want to stall on the outboard, because that's where you have the best moment to control your body (i.e. aircraft have ailerons more on the outboard) -- check some youtube videos of hovering/landing birds to see how their muscles control the feathers. If you can keep the flow attached over that outer section, you'll prevent stall. To me, that feather looks a lot like a [leading edge slat commonly found on aircraft](_URL_0_), which would aid in allowing those larger outboard feathers to control the bird's attitude.\n\n\nI'll add that it's a mistake to assume all biological features have a \"purpose\" or \"function.\" It could a remnant of something that was useful further up in the evolutionary tree, or it could just be some genetic quirk that stuck around.\n\nOh, and I'm not terribly caught up on the state of research from the biological side. If this is actually an important mystery to people that study birds let me know; it could be enough of a reason for me to throw some computer time at it =P\n\n\nedit: After gazing at [this youtube video of a hawk hovering](_URL_1_), I'm reasonably confident that that feather is functioning as some kind of combination between a leading-edge slat and a vortex generator, both of which would energize the boundary layer of the controlling sections of wing directly behind it and aid in control."

        "selftext": "Let me preface by saying I have no clue what I'm talking about.\n\nThe CO_2 causes Venus to trap in more heat from the sun, thus making the surface temperature nearly 900F degrees. If we introduce, plant or plant like(I say plant-like because I know it is too hot for normal plant life), organisms that convert CO_2 into oxygen, theoretically we could lower the temperature enough to make it inhabitable for humans.\nI believe that the high CO_2 is also causing the atmospheric pressure to be extremely high compared to Earth, so the Oxygen will help to lower the ATM.\n\n",

As I recall, one source cites the lack of support by the Judean People's Front leadership to the plan to allow men to gestate babies in a box. Others have said it was the lack of availability of truly crunchy wolf nipple chips. While they were hot (and lovely), they were not crunchy. This caused a rift in the rank and file membership and ultimately caused the founders of the People's Front of Judea to go their own way.\n\nA relatively unknown fact is that the People's Front of Judea also didn't like the Judean Popular People's Front, either.",

You could say that the PFJ was much more aware of the positive effects the Romans had on the Judean region. Don't be mistaken though, the truly hated the Romans.

They were also very vocal and positive about the Roman wine, medicine, public health and irrigation. Most of all, they recognized the fact that the Roman military was probably one of the only known organizations capable of maintaining public order in a place like that. However, despite all of this, they still hated the Romans **a lot** and often raised the question as to what the Romans had ever done for them.\n\n In contrast, the JPF never even acknowledged these improvements and they were a lot more linear in their thinking.

                "I see PFJ's progressive stance on mens' rights to have babies, regardless of having a womb led to more men to join PFJ. The more men in PFJ led to that group having a bigger role in the patriarchal society of the time.   Thus the JPF fell by the wayside.",

(We will pass by the short lived People Of The Paragraph - their story is just too sad.) As People Of The Sentence, they were hyper-aware of the importance of sentence structure. And indeed unpublished sources tell of endless printer's ink being spilled in the endless Writer versus Editor struggles.\n\nPeople's Front of Judea clearly puts the People into the position of honor. The movement was far more interested in, and enthusuastic about, individuals being the most important factor.  This would be revived later as The Great Man theory.\n\nRejecting this, in favor of putting the community identity as critical, the Judean People's Front emphasizes the importance of the masses. This would later lead to Social Revisionist history.\n\nTwo groups with less in common cannot be easily thought of. About the only thing they shared was the ability to always look on the bright side of life.\n\nSource: A Wasted Youth, privately printed 2010, by Eternally65, PhS, LCD, FRHG.",
                "You also need to remember that JPF was actually willing to engage in a dialogue with Bickus Dickus about how awful the Roman empire was, and how all Romans were wankers who needed to go home. The PFJ was dead set upon any interaction with Romans, no matter how awful they were, as such conversations and heckling would only legitimize the continued presence of the Roman imperialists.\n On the other side, the JPF felt that actively insulting Roman nobles, rather than sullen grumbling, was an effective political tactic in repelling the Roman imperialists.\n\n Source: Bickus Dickus, Di Amor di Incontinentea Buttox",
                "The People's Front of Judea and the Judean People's Front both had their origin in the Social Democratic Party of Judea, which later became complacent with working within the Roman provincial system for incremental gains, forgetting its revolutionary origins.\n\nThe PFJ and JPF began in the left faction of the SDPJ. Soon, this faction began agitation for armed resistance, while the party's dominant faction claimed that revolutionary conditions had not yet been met. The left faction split off from the party, denouncing the remaining SDPJ as social fasces-ists. However, not a few years later, internal divisions emerged in the nascent People's Front, laying the groundwork for the future split into the PFJ and the JPF.\n\nThose in what would become the People's Front of Judea argued that the revolutionary class would be the proletarii, those with little to no property, allied with the urban slaves. The PFJ advanced the view that the material conditions of these classes necessitated their eventual action against the Roman provincial order, whereas the rural peasant class represented more reactionary interests. Meanwhile, the Judean People's Front argued that as Judea lacked the urbanization of Rome, the PFJ's revolutionary theory had to be adapted to the real material conditions of the province. The JPF thus focused on the radicalization of the Judean peasant class, though debate over the extent of their inclusion of wealthier peasants remains heated, especially in consideration of accusations of some of their leaders' links to wealthier peasant family members. \n\nThe JPF further split between the main party and the JPF (Maoist) in 12 AD. Another faction split into the Judean Popular People's Front, disagreeing with the main party's stance against religion, arguing that the Jewish religion was a traditionally imperialized religion, separate from the traditionally imperialist religion of the Romans, and that it was thus racist to denounce it, taking criticisms of the religion as criticisms of the imperialized people who followed it. The JPPF allied with the Zealots and eventually blended into their movement. The JPPF was further alienated from the rest of the movement when a member of the JPF (Maoist) [assassinated a religious leader who had a controversial relationship with the Romans and the people's favorite opium](_URL_0_).\n\nMeanwhile, the People's Front of Judea experienced its own schism, as a small faction split off into the Popular Front of Judea, claiming to follow the revolutionary theory of Josip Broz Tito. At first glance, this appears to be an anachronism, given that Marshal Tito was not born until some 18 and a half centuries later, but the historical record is unimpeachable here and so we are left with some competing theories to explain this revolutionary development. Refer to earlier posts on Time Lords and automobiles manufactured by the DeLorean Motor Company.\n\nAnd don't get me started on the Judean Anarchist Federation...",
                "There's a well known quote in Judaean Insurrectionist Studies of the Late Second Temple Period: \"Four insurrectionists, six movements.\" Because of their antinomian tendencies, the groups' refusal of Roman or Torah or priestly authority also led to distrust of any authority whatsoever, even among like-minded individuals, and hostility to the appearance of submission to anything like authority. Any point of ideological difference was not resolved by submission to authority or consensus, but by creation of very specific policy statements to which all followers must adhere. Ideological purity was considered more important than group cohesiveness or even action. An action driven by improper (or even suspect) ideology was worse than no action at all.\n\nThe Popular Front of Judaea (PFoJ) was only the second schism. The Front for the People's Judaea (FPJ) split off from the JPF, and, along with elements more sympathetic to the PFJ but still wary of fasces-ist tendencies, was eventually absorbed into the Federated Alliance of Greater Canaan, which, within two years had dissolved along a quadraxial Samaritan-Tyrean/Pharisaic-Zealot/Brianist-Sadducaic/Punic Restorationist divide after the Rapprochement Ballot was ignominiously mooted. While some attempted to recreate an anti-Roman union of movements, the Greater Alliance for a Federated Canaan, fœderalist motions were ultimately pushed aside in the unilateral Revolt of the Kanaim of 70.",

In general, prices for coastal areas are only slightly decreasing because the demand for them also only slightly decreases from an ideal economic standpoint. \n\nYou can also think of it from the standpoint of a buyer. Someone buying a house now will naturally inspect it and the surrounding area. They probably have no idea of the history of the place and where the water was years ago. All they see now is (for example) that the beach reaches 200m until it hits the water. Since climate change comes slowly they might not even notice the water creep up to them until it is within much closer proximity (say 50m) over the course of years, depending in which area they are. Only in the last few meters they actually realize what will/could happen and that is when the prices will drop.\n\n & nbsp;\n\nFor the whole \"eye over brain\"-discussion you can look up the [bacteria in a bottle gedankenexperiment](_URL_0_) which works with exponential functions (the natural language of growth) and you can ask yourself how much of it you find \"plausible and natural\".\n\nIt is imo a fitting analogy to energy consumption and population increase which is the main cause for the climate change.",

                "PhD in economics here - prices are based on expectations of future value. If people don't expect the value to fall (i.e. don't believe in climate change/don't think it's serious), the current price will reflect that.\n\nAlso a lot of places (certainly the U.S.) has flood insurance etc. so people don't expect to lose money even if they do see increased flooding.",
                "Several reasons:\n\n1) A sea-level rise of 3-5cm per decade isn't significant to most property values. That can be mitigated by pretty-standard property maintenance. Generally speaking, anyone who buys coastal property as a long-term investment is prepared to maintain it to this level.\n\n2) Property-market prices are heavily influenced by units which turn over quickly. These tend to be higher-priced properties, since people are less inclined to sell properties whose prices are stagnant or falling. \n\n3) The primary risk from sea-level rise isn't the level of the sea, but storm surge. This risk is pretty unpredictable, but coastal areas are generally skilled at mitigating it — for instance, by spreading the risk among many people through property insurance.\n\n4) Most individuals' longest-term horizon for property-owning is a generation or two. Forty years would be a very long horizon. Climate effects just aren't strong enough to reliably affect prices in this term. \n\n5) The main influence on property prices is demand, since as is famously said about real estate: They ain't making any more of it. So as long as a region's population and wealth continue to rise, its property prices will rise. And they will probably rise faster than average at the coast, as long as people tend to value coastal property over inland property.\n\nCalling climate change \"a serious threat\" is kind of like calling an extinction-level asteroid impact or alien invasion \"a serious threat.\" The resulting impacts are devastating, but if you approach the problem rationally then you also have to estimate your likelihood of encountering those devastating impacts — and that usually comes down to your assumptions about the time frame involved. Over the course of a billion years, an extinction-level asteroid's *approach* toward Earth is pretty likely. But in your lifetime, the actual impacts you'll see are likely to be minimal.\n\nAnd the same is probably true for climate change. I doubt you'll see large numbers of people selling coastal property for cents on the dollar in your lifetime. I often tell people that if anyone feels climate-spooked enough to panic-sell at that level now, they should give me a call. But nobody ever does. I guess there is some climate panic out there, but the rationality of the property market remains basically undisturbed for now.\n\nEdit: typo",
                "Flood insurance is Federally backed and does not accurately price in the risk of living in flood prone areas.   Also many of these properties are second homes bought by the rich so the government is less likely to change this status quo.

This is an American answer, not sure about the rest of the world.",
                "Real estate prices are about current demand not long term risk.

Climate change isn’t really a part of the 5-10 year plans, but it’s most definitely part of the 30 year plans. There have been studies showing which states will be affected by climate change the most, and the least, and the clients are paying attention.

Instead of taking a huge loss selling, they get converted into rentals. Alternately the houses just sit in the market for a really long time as people try desperately to get what they paid for the house back.",
                "The simple answer is that it's not imminent.\n\nIt's the exact same reason Houston, Miami, Hawaii, still have valuable property.

                "Because the value of living in a coastal area that will be inundated by flood waters is high enough during all the time that it's NOT inundated by flood waters that demand remains high.  See the NC Outer Banks -- nobody is disputing that those homes will get wrecked by hurricanes eventually but people still build and real estate still sells.\n\nThe Federal Government supports this by offering low priced flood insurance which the Government comes out ahead on because it collects taxes on all the economic activity that is generated by eventually flooded properties meaning it shows a net gain (since the Government doesn't have to make money on insurance premiums to profit)",
                "Because it only affects homes that look at risk.  Most home owners don't instantly go, \"oh that oak tree is going to grow into my septic tank in 15 years\"  or \"maybe a forest fire will burn my house surrounded by woods\" but it still happens and people pay crazy amounts to have a mansion in the woods or too keep that tree that gives the yard character.  They look at the superficial aspect and if it seems in good repair it must be a good house.  I live very near Lake Michigan so I constantly see super expensive homes go up in flood areas that are close to the river and others on the cliffs overlooking the lake.  But we also see the older existing homes being tore down or being sold for less than before because of water damage and erosion.  We have had multiple homes in the area collapse down the hill into the lake.  I suppose they don't hold very much value when the danger is perceived as imminent.  \nA few homes are supported by stilts too keep them from just falling down.  Once all the old houses fall or get tore down new ones (slightly farther back) pop up.",
                "NPR had a great interview last week related to this topic. Can't recall the interviewees name, but he released a book on the history of people living on US coast lines. I'll summarize what I can.\n\nSo, insurance companies learned in the 1920's that it is not economically feasible to make a profit providing flood insurance to coastal homes (floods happen often and cause massive destruction instead of minor damage). Since there was no way to insure oneself against coastal flooding not a lot of development occurred directly on the coast (hotels and other businesses maybe, but not houses).\n\nThen, in the 1960s, LBJ commissioned a study to see if it was viable for the Government to provide some type of Flood Insurance because developers desperately wanted to start building and selling homes directly off the coast. The study found that it would likely be possible to do this if a couple of key rules were followed. First, the premiums had to be really high because its extremely expensive to rebuild/repair after flood damage. Second, there could be NO government subsidies (ie gov't covers part of the expensive premiums) because doing so would not be economically viable (again, price of covering flood damage/destruction is really high).\n\nWelp, the study led to the National Flood Insurance Program, but of course those subsidies the Government shouldn't have allowed? Well they allowed them. So now you have flood insurance on the cheap, which led to a boom of coastal development and purchasing.\n\nSo people kept re-building because they had the insurance to do so and because they could keep affording the premiums, which allowed demand for coastal homes to stay high even though its stupid to do so because floods will likely happen again and destroy the home again. And if demand is high, then home prices will continue to increase.\n\nThe Government now only allows for a home to be rebuilt 3 times, after that they won't cover your expensive premiums (this may be part of the original 1968 legislation, not sure on that). With Climate Change and more flooding, people are hitting that 3rd rebuild quicker than in the past (this is currently happening in places like Houston). So, we are starting to see some instances of people moving away from the coast, because they can't afford to re-build on their own.\n\nSo, why have we not see a drastic drop on coastal home pricing? Its a mix of greed from the private sector and mis-management of a government program. AKA the cause of the majority of issues in the US.  \n\n\n\n\nEDIT: the book is \"Geography of Risk\" by journalist Gilbert M. Gaul",
                "I think this is also a good psychology question. Demand for coastal homes still hasn't dropped, hence why prices haven't dropped. So the question is, why are people still willing to pay premium dollars for a home that years of research has proven to be in an incredibly risky area.\n\nI think you would need to start looking at the psychology of climate denial, apathy, and risk/reward behaviors to get your answer.",
                "The most simple answer is the misinformation campaign has been effective. Energy companies and big business have been spending a fortune to convince people climate change is ‘fear mongering’ as the other commenter put it. And it has been incredibly effective, unfortunately. First off, no one is saying that death is coming tomorrow, this month, this year, or even this decade. What is being talked about is the inter generational responsibility that we have. We should start the work now to reverse the effects of climate change so that future generations aren’t stuck with an irreversible problem. \n\nNow as far as your question, the reason is because the danger is not imminent. Again, it’s years away. And the reason we’re in this mess and having trouble getting out is because of how short sighted humans are. No one thinks about humans 50 years from now because presumably most of us will be dead. Same goes for housing values. No one is thinking what will my house be worth in 50 years, I’ll be dead.\n\nAs we move close to the true danger levels, you’ll start to see a shift of people moving inland. You’ll also see people moving out of hotter climate areas. People will leave Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, places of that nature because the average temps will go up by a few degrees. They will end up Middle East hot and will eventually become unlivable. People will flock to the north and to the Midwest. States along the border of Canada will see a huge influx of new residents. Souther Texas will be abandoned as will most states on the southern border. If there is an increase in average temps of 5-10 degrees, many places there cannot be comfortably lived in.\n\nNow a 10 degree shift is not in the near future. No one alive today will see that increase. But we will see the steady increase of maybe 2-3 degrees during our lifetime.\n\nThis is all assuming that we don’t shift our priorities and start focusing on undoing what’s been done. But even if we do, there will still be an increase in temps in the short term because we’re already on the path. Even if we correct our direction now, there is still going to be a correction period. The change will not be immediate.",
                "People that don’t believe in climate change will have no problem buying in coastal areas because they don’t see it as a threat. It just means that they ( or much more likely their kids) will be screwed when the houses are worth less. But we have already seen some low laying land in Miami areas affected by climate change but it’s like a 7% drop(according to Harvard) there won’t be a run on property.\n\nAlso you should go read an annual report of top US hotel companies in US that have lots of coastal properties. They seem to think it’s risk to their assets.",
                "No capital entity will ever allow profit leakage until the entire asset class is universally abandoned.\n\nWhy is there food wastage? Why do grocery stores dispose of unsold produce? People are always hungry, in fact it breaks the idea of supply/demand: The demand for food is infinite, every person needs food every day. So why is there food waste? Because giving it away or reducing its price reveals that it doesn't have to be sold at the price. You avoid profit leakage to avoid full-on profit annihilation; once people know all the produce is half price in the last hour of business, half price jist becomes *the* price and anyone shopping before the reduction is just paying a fee for convenient shopping hours.\n\nSo why sell a coastal home for half its value? That would just be admitting this thing is gonna *completely* worthless soon and the market won't buy a soon-to-be-worthless asset no matter how big the discount.",
                "There is one other factor that no one else seems to be mentioning. \n\nAlong with flood insurance subsidies from the govt. State and even city level governments are subsiding coastal homes in another way. \n\nBeach replenishment. As climate change moves forward and average temperatures rise we see an increase in the overall frequency and power of storms. Most beaches are not naturally sandy, most are rocky. Costal cities and towns all over the US bring in sand to make the beaches more tourist friendly. However these wide artificial beaches also make for pretty good erosion protection, allowing beach homes over the last 100 year or so to be built much closer than they were historically. \n\n Now with storms being more powerful and frequent they wash away the sand (not natural to the area) faster exposing the houses to erosion risk and the towns to decreased tourism revenue. The towns cities and states then bring in sand to replace the lost beach. The cycle will continue until the cost is to great to replenish the beach, at that point prices will start to tank.\n\n\nPeople are very bad at planning for the future and acting proactively. Usually things need to start falling apart before anyone actually reacts. We are seeing this with climate change now (we've known about it since the start of the industrial revolution) and we will see it with beach properties in the future. Everything will be fine until one day it isn't.",

I know numerous people buying arctic because of climate change. \n\nI don’t recall who, but some group did analysis for next hundred years and mapped results for investors to be able to shift holdings responsibly before the changes happen and make their land worthless and other land a super premium rate. \n\nI should state it’s all hypothesis and speculation based on current data. It might be an over reaction. I know many people who have changed purchases based on the above and other factors.",
                "Because flood insurance is too costly for insurance companies to cover so the government actually covers floods, as disaster relief was becoming too expensive to deal with without insurance. \n\nSo the government has spent lets say $800,000 on a house that's actually worth $100,000, multiple times over, and it's actually a huge problem.

                "I want to point out that the sea won't rise in like a standardized way in every area. Eustatic sea level rise is just the physical \"more water equals higher seas\" way of looking at it. The continents behave like buoyant objects. This buoyancy - \"Isostacy\" - is the effect you will see when ice melts. It's when a part of earth's crust rises due to less of a load on it from, in this case, ice. So you'll see some areas that are still isostatically rebounding from the last ice age rising, while others are inundated with water from eustacy. This is just to explain part of the misconception of how sea level rises (tectonics and local effects also play a part).\n\nNow when it comes to why real-estate prices aren't drastically decreasing... I'm not sure that they aren't. We have systems of levees that keep some areas dry that shouldn't be. But there are places where a single storm event completely leveled a town and took real estate prices from *something* to non-existent (because there was no land to sell).

St. Helens blowing up (people refused to leave, for example) or rattlesnake bites (hold my beer) or climate change (my property is mine).  \n\n\nWe even see examples where I live in Colorado. We've had a rash of bear encounters this last year, and the victim's response is sometimes \"I built my house here, why are they on my property?\". Well, for one, bears mark property by scratching and peeing, not by drawing lines on a map with dollar signs. And two, you left your trash out and the bear found out-- what did you think was going to happen? And yet they insist that this is theirs and seem to be legitimately confused as to why the bear doesn't recognize that. (Some do recognize it, but a surprising number do not-- much to my amazement). Anyway, same thing with climate change. In their mind, the human went through all the right steps to earn money and purchase the property, and the weather will somehow (magically) understand and respect that.  \n\n\nAs a last example I am reminded of King Canut, yes, he is real.

He felt that the property and risk markets are so far out of equilibrium that it would be unwise to place bets on sea level rise impacts, yet. By simply extrapolating the mean sea level rise and predictable ocean tides, you could quite reliably predict \"sunny day\" flood events in Annapolis, Md, and you could probably make a reasonably accurate prediction of the added economic costs related to this kind of flooding, but to make money off of this you would be betting against an opponent with effectively infinite resources to mitigate short-term losses.\n\nInvestors with sufficient resources are likely placing long-term bets, but they probably won't pay off for another 20 to 50 yrs.

So while we are advising almost complete red zoning of the coastline nothing is done at a political level.\n\nPeople are still building on the coast because the zoning is for residential, so they assume why not, if it floods it's the governments fault for not telling me and they will pay.",

                "Because most people don’t take it seriously or don’t want to take it seriously. Myself on the other hand who has built my little empire in S. Florida is planning ahead. First reason is because I want to leave my kids something. I won’t see the land flooded but they might. They say the Florida Keys will mostly be gone in just 50-60 years. When prices crash all my work will have been for nothing.\n\nSecond reason is to beat the land rush. Once the majority of people get it, then things will happen quickly I’m afraid. Also, you only mentioned shore prices going down but inland  prices will go up. I bought a. Outlet acres cheap in N. Georgia and plan to add to it. 10 years till retirement and I want all my Florida property gone by then. Pack up and leave, course, can still visit in Winter!",
                "Simply put, people don’t price that far into the future. The beach front homes in the USA still have at least ten years of being awesome, so the prices will stay high. When it starts going downhill, prices will drop. \n\nYour argument is similar to someone saying you shouldn’t buy a PS4 because a PS5 is coming. And that you should skip the PS5 too. Eventually you’re just missing out entirely, or you gotta get in the game. (PS being the different generations of Playstation video game consoles.)"

Rich enough to want their children educated, poor enough that hiring a private tutor was beyond them. So some enterprising teachers set up \"public\" schools where these middle class families could send their children if they had the money.\n\nThese schools did pretty well and educated a bunch of guys who became successful.

",
                "The chance for birth defects in inbreeding animals is exactly the same as with humans. It's simply that they do not show as much. Many inbreeding problems are associated with less intelligence or malformity. Now in an animal you seldom will know when one is a little bit less intelligent than another. Also body deformity does not always show so well in animals. There are goats herds in south america where the offspring isn't separated thus inbreeds. There are many goats with 4 horns instead of 2. ",
                "There aren't that many defects if siblings breed. Over several generations things can get messy though. ",
                "There are also lethal mutations. It's not uncommon for an embryo to die very early development. \n\nEveryone has some embryonic lethal mutations. If you mate with a sibling, theres a high probability you have some of the same lethal mutations. If the embryo inherits the same lethal from both parents - bye bye. Don't see it. \n\nI can't agree or disagree with the claim that animals don't suffer from inbreeding to the same extent. My reasoning can't support that claim. Inbreeding is devastating to small populations. ",
                "Natural selection is more ruthless in the animal kingdom. Bad genes are weeded out more effectively",
                "Yeah if you've got defects in the animal kingdom then you're on your own... and not for very long ",
                "Inbreeding is just as much of a problem for animals. So much so that many species have evolved methods of avoiding it, such as males leaving the areas where they were born while their sisters stay closer to home. In endangered species, where populations may be very small, you often see signs of \"inbreeding depression\" - lowered survival and reproductive ability due to a lack of genetic diversity.\n\nInbreeding is also a huge concern for zoos, with their small captive populations. Zoos keep pedigrees for lot of species bred in captivity, so they can avoid breeding related individuals with each other.\n\nYou can see the consequences in pets if you think of purebred dogs, for example. Many dog breeds are likely to get specific medical issues, such as hip dysplasia in golden retrievers, due to many generations of inbreeding.\n",
                "One reason is because nature clears out those with major defects pretty quick. Though in Boulder, CO there was a group of deer near the outskirts that was interbreeding for awhile and they started getting goofy, like running into traffic, and also had defects, like one sided antlers. ",
                "White tigers aren't naturally occuring in nature and the only way to get the white fur is through inbreeding, so a lot of white tigers are affected with club foot, and other issues, I know that they can get downs syndrome as well, but im not sure if thats a result of being inbred.\n",
                "1. Animal inbreeding is also bad\n\n2. The likelihood of defects from inbreeding is lower than people think. One generation of inbreeding only slightly increases the chances. Regular inbreeding over many generations is what really causes problems\n\n3. Animals with birth defects are unlikely to survive and be observed, while most humans can be kept alive",
                "There really *isn't* that high a chance of birth defects when humans produce offspring with siblings.  It's several generations of repeated incest where high rates of birth defects start to pop up. \n\nAlso, animal defects would likely be either inconsequential or bring early death.  Extra finger on a kid, we'd see it.  Extra toe on a paw, so?  A deaf or blind animal isn't going to last too long in the wild.",
                "Humans, in general, are quite inbred due to some catastrophic event that occurred 75,000 years ago (toba eruption possibly).\n\nIf you compared the similarities between people within our own population, to similarities in other species  population, you would find we don't have near the same genetic diversity.\n\nWe know this because of mDNA, that is DNA that is only passed down to you by your mother. We can calculate the average rate of genetic mutation (in mDNA) and infer from this that every human on earth has descended from as few as 10000 humans that survived this event. \n\nThere's even a mitochondrial \"eve\" so to speak.\n\nTLDR: Humans are pretty inbred, compared to other species. Inbreeding leads to loss of genetic variation. Loss of genetic variation leads to unbenificial mutations in our DNA propogating. Which is why inbreeding in humans is not the same as in animals."

It's not always used, but if it is then the autopilot would likely be in control of the plane from a few moments after take-off all the way to the moment all the wheels are on the ground. Humans are responsible for everything else, from the outside safety inspection of the plane to starting the engines, taxiing the airplane to the runway and taking off.\n\nThat said, the autopilots don't handle failures very well. If the instruments feeding information to them stop working or any of their consistency tests fail, they produce an alarm and relinquish control of the plane. For the auto-land thing above (at least on some models of airplane) BOTH autopilots need to be activated and if they start disagreeing about what to do then auto-land is aborted.\n\nWhen in doubt, the human is the last line of defence against malfunctions. Also robots can't talk to Air Traffic Control yet. :)",

The refugees from Troy were mostly embattled heroes and warriors, not the dregs of society.\n\n >  why were they unashamed of their origin story?\n\nBecause it was *true*.\n\nI think that, far from the Romans portraying themselves unflatteringly, *you're* the one who's gone to extreme lengths to highlight (and invent?) the bad parts of their origin story. Their version was a lot more balanced, and showed a lot more triumph over adversity, and positivity, than your version.\n",

Second: I worry that you're projecting modern views about how an origins myth ought to be sanitized, glorious, and ennobling. Most Greco-Roman myths are not the best places to look for a good moral or uplifting message--foundation myths or otherwise.\n\nPerhaps the more interesting question here is why we think myths should have a 'positive' message (whatever that means) and why the Romans were ok with the moral ambiguities inherent in their origins stories in a way that we are not.

                "Lab mice are almost all 100% inbred already; it's impossible to inbreed them any further.  \n\nThe whole point about using (most strains of) lab mice is that they're genetically identical to each other.  If you have one male BALB/c mouse in your lab in Boston, it should be exactly the same (genetically) as the male BALB/c mouse in a lab in Japan, and in the lab in Jackson Harbor, Maine, and in Brazil and Germany.\n\nHow do you make sure that mice are genetically identical? You inbreed them until there's no more variation in them.  There's a Wikipedia article on [inbred strains of mice and rats](_URL_0_) which in turn links to methods of generating inbred genetically identical mice: [Backcrossing](_URL_2_), [line breeding](_URL_3_), and so on.\n\nDoes this mean that mice have genetic defects due to inbreeding? Sure. In some cases, those turn out to be useful for researching genetic defects. In other cases, they're just something researchers work around, or maybe ignore. But remember that \"defect\" is relative. A domestic cow that is optimal for a farmer has horrible genetic defects as a wild animal; an aurochs would have horrible genetic defects as a domestic cow.  Lab mice are kept in cages in temperature- and humidity-controlled environments all their life; \"defects\" have to be considered in that context.\n\nFinally, all of this is a little theoretical. Spontaneous mutations are common enough that, technically, no two mice are going to be genetically identical -- they'll have a dozen, or dozens of, unique mutations. [Epigenetic differences](_URL_1_) also affect them. \n\nBut as far as inbreeding is concerned, it's a feature, not a bug. ",

It is possible to deliberately induce mutations in the 'standard' animals and look for changes that approximate human disease.

Land animals adapted their eyes from their aquatic origins including sensitivity to colors other than green and blue which are transmitted in water where red is absorbed, as well as changes to lens design, the aqueous humors that fill our eye, and blocking of UV light and protection of the pigments and cells in the eye from oxidative and environmental damage. \n\n"

                " >  It is hardly disputed that in the whole vast literature of witchcraft, the most prominent, the most important, the most authoritative volume is the *Malleus Maleficarum (The Witch Hammer)* of Heinrich Kramer (Henricus Institoris) and James Sprenger. The date of the first edition of the *Malleus* cannot be fixed with absolute certainty, but the likeliest year is 1486. There were, at any rate, fourteen editions between 1487 and 1520, and at least sixteen editions between 1574 and 1669. These were issued from the leading German, French and Italian presses. The latest reprint of the original text of the *Malleus* is to be found in the noble four volume collection of Treatises on Witchcraft, \"sumptibus Claudii Bourgeat\", 4to., Lyons, 1669. There is a German translation by J. W. R. Schmidt, *Der Hexenhammer*, 3 vols, Berlin, 1906; second edition, 1922-3. There is also an English translation with Introduction, Bibliography, and Notes by Montague Summers, published John Rodker, 1928. [...] In fact, \"it fastened on European jurisprudence for nearly three centuries the duty of combating\" the Society of Witches. The *Malleus* lay on the bench of every judge, on the desk of every magistrate. It was the ultimate, irrefutable, unarguable authority. It was implicitly accepted not only by Catholic but by Protestant literature. In fine, it is not too much to say that the *Malleus Maleficarum* is among the most important, wisest, and weightiest books of the world.\n\n- Montague Summers, introduction to the [1948 edition](_URL_1_).\n\nYou have to take Summers with a grain of salt: while extremely erudite in the subject of the occult, the Reverend's actual belief and tendency toward exaltation of occult literature can skew the perception of facts a little. Nevertheless, it does emphasize that the *Malleus* was extraordinarily popular, and for an extensive period of time. A lot of this had to do with utility and demand.\n\nIf you look at the volumes available to authorities on witchcraft in the period, you have works like Johannes Nider's *Formicarius* (1475); while this was popular and helped define the image and concept of the witch as we know it, this work was not geared toward either a lay audience or legal use since it was quite literally written as a teacher-student dialogue on the lives of ants. The section on witchcraft was actually absorbed into the *Malleus*.\n\nAnd authorities at the period *needed* a work on heresy and witchcraft. Civil courts and authorities were under greater pressure to work with ecclesiastic courts and authorities to address both heresy and *maleficium*, and the framework of Roman Law which was highly influential on the courts of Europe required a certain amount of legalistic wrangling to deal with the contemporary issues of witchcraft. While the Protestant Reformation had not yet occurred, there were still schisms within the church, which inquisitors rooted out as heresy. H. R. Trevor-Roper in [The European Witch-Craze of the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries](_URL_0_) writes:\n\n >  When the Dominicans pressed for inquisitorial power over witchcraft, the papacy had at first resisted. The old canons of the Church, and particularly the *canon Episcopi*, denied the reality of witches and forbade their persecution. Therefore, in 1257, Pope Alexander IV had refused these demands unless manifest heresy, not merely witchcraft, could be proved. But little by little, under constant pressure, the papacy had yielded.  The great surrender had been made by the French popes of Avignon, and particularly by the two popes from southern France, John XXII and his successor Benedict XII, who had already, as bishops in Languedoc, waged war on nonconformity in the old Albigensian and Vaudois areas. John XXII, who declared heretical the Franciscan doctrine of the poverity of Christ (so dangerously akin to the old Vaudois ideas), also, by his constitution *Super illius specula* of 1325, authorized he full use of inquisitorial procedure against witches, of who he lived in personal terror. For the next century and a half--until the Witch Bull of Innocent VIII, and indeed afterwards--the main effort of the inquisitors (although there were some spectacular 'political' witchcraft trials in France, Burgundy and England) had been directed against the witches of the Alps and the Pyrenees.\n\nSummers gives a good run-down of some of the \"political\" witchcraft trials in his introduction to the *Malleus*; sorcery was effectively the civil counterpart to the ecclesiastical charge of heresy, and civil authorities could actually pass mortal sentences, which ecclesiastical courts could not--this was the standard inquisitorial practice, to hand over heretics to secular authorities for further persecution and punishment. This practice applied to all cases before the inquisition, not just the political ones, so as the *scope* of the inquisition expanded to include witchcraft, the need by civil authorities to address the question of witchcraft expanded as well. This brings us to Pope Innocent VIII, who in 1484:\n\n >  [...] issued *Summis desiderantes* at the request of two Dominican inquisitors, Heinrich Kramer (or Institoris) and Jacob Sprenger, who had worked in southern Germany and encountered some resistance in their search for heretics. The Bull formally removes all impediments to the completion of Kramer and Sprenger's mission.\n\n- Edward Peters, [The Magician, The Witch, and the Law](_URL_2_), 170\n\nPeters goes on to note that the Papal bull was not, in itself, remarkable - previous popes had issued bulls with much the same language and for much the same purpose, to authorize members of the clergy and clear away local opposition. However, two years after it was issue, it was included as the preface to the *Malleus Maleficarum* - a text Innocent himself had probably never seen - and in that context, being bundled with the book, gave the book greater authority, beyond even the area of Germany which most concerned the inquisitors. This in part helped its transmission, but the other part is the nature of the book itself. Peters 173-174:\n\n >  All scholars agree that the form of the work, that of a series of scholastic *quaestiones*, derives from handbooks for inquisitors, of which Eymeric's is the best example. Within the framework of *quaestiones* arranged into three major parts, owever, the work is intellectually inferior to Eymeric's and hardly to be considered \"scholastic\" in the original sense of that term at all. What is striking about the *Malleus* is its economic use of the *quaestio* form to bring together elements from all of the diverse sources that had provided elements of the new fifteenth-century beliefs in magic in the first place. The juxtaposition of these elements in a single, concentrated, tightly argued treatise of considerably greater length than any earlier work really constituted the basis of the popularity of the *Malleus* during the next two centuries. [...] In no other work are theology and law so tightly linked. Even if, as I have suggested above, the *Malleus* made no discernible impact on the prosecution of magicians and witches for nearly half a century, no comparable work approached its comprehensiveness until those of Bodin and Remy, Del Rio and Boguet, at the end of the sixteenth century.\n\nThe *Malleus* was not alone in its generation. Writings about witchcraft, even printed works, were extensive, with titles like *Tractatus contra Daemonum Invocatores* (1450) by Jean Vinet, *Fortalicium fidei contra fidei christianae hostes* (1467) by Alfonso de Spina, *Flagellum Maleficorum* (c.1490) by Petrus Mamoris. The *Laienspiegel* (1509) by Ulrich Tengler in particular was incredibly popular, because like the *Malleus* it was a legal work looking at the different aspects of witchcraft in regard to private, public, and criminal law; it went through fourteen editions. But the *Malleus* was uniquely suited to spread, because of its relatively early date, because it was organized in a manner useful to legal authorities, and because the spread of the printing press made it much more accessible to this ready market that was in demand for such a way. Judges and magistrates required a legal text for dealing with the problems posed by accusations of sorcery and heresy, and the *Malleus* was almost encyclopedic compared to other contemporary texts.\n\nThis, combined with the popularity of the *Malleus* and its relative accessibility also made it something of an authority on witchcraft which many subsequent demonologists would refer to, quote from, or cite as a reference; a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy where a book is popular because it is known to be popular. While there is a popular rumor that it was banned by the Church and placed on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum, I haven't been able to confirm that with any of my sources at hand. ",
                "In addition, who was printing it? I feel like the church would have had a bigger issue with people printing it and making it available for sale than with people buying it. ",
                "As a follow-up, due to the expense of books, was there much fiction published during these periods? If not, I can imagine it being bought for entertainment purposes - the world's first fantasy novel, in other words. Weren't fairy tales primarily oral?",
                "While it's true that the Church maintained a broadly cautious attitude toward witch hunting, it was not the clergy that the *Malleus* was aimed at. Instead, Kramer attempted to promote his book among secular lords, princes, courts and town councils. Indeed, one of the central points of the book was that, due the exceptional nature of their crimes, witches should be prosecuted by secular authorities. As no full vernacular edition of the *Malleus* was ever published, its readership was restricted to only the most educated classes - chiefly lawyers and theologians.\n\nKramer himself seems to have been something of an anathema in his own time. The 'senile' comment came from Bishop Golser of Tyrol, who had resisted Kramer's attempts to foment a brutal witch persecution in Innsbrook and had him expelled from his diocese under threat of physical violence a year before the *Malleus* was published. We do not know of a single witch being condemned in Tyrol following this affair. After the publication of the *Malleus*, Ulrich Molitor, a lawyer who had worked as an official at Innsbrook, penned a critique of Kramer's views that was republished more times throughout the 1490s than the *Malleus* itself. Kramer himself was ridiculed by Erasmus of Rotterdam in the satirical *Praise of Folly*, and labelled a drunkard by the humanist Konrad Peutinger. As such, 'widespread acceptance' may be something of an exaggeration.\n\nNevertheless, by the time the *Malleus* was published, anxieties about witchcraft were already on the rise, with early witch trials beginning to take place in several European jurisdictions. As a demonological work, the book actually offered little in the way of new ideas, but as a self-purported definitive guide for the handling of witchcraft cases, the book suited the needs of judges and lawyers perfectly. The extent to which the *Malleus* directly influenced the spread of witch hysteria is still debated, but it seems likely that the book owed much of its popularity to pre-existing fears. The *Malleus* also received a wider audience amongst secular rulers who harboured a personal interest in the subject of witchcraft or were simply drawn to the novelty of such a text."

That would explain why OP effectively has one voice for German, and a slightly different one for English. It's just his vocal system being more efficient. \n\nI'm imagining something like a 'vocal posture', where a speaker holds his vocal apparatus in a particular way, in preparation for efficiently making specific types of sounds. (Bit like a dancer or a martial artist with their stances.) Anecdotally, I notice that the sounds of the Indian languages I speak feel much looser than English, which feels much more clipped and precise. German gives a similar feeling to English, while Spanish or Italian seem to be relatively loose in comparison. ",
                "I have a masters in theoretical linguistics and did my dissertation on language acquisition, so I'll offer what I know from that perspective.\n\nEvery language has a difference in *tone* and *pitch*. German speakers speak with a higher pitch than English. Similarly, Italians speak with a higher pitch than Spanish speakers. When we learn a language, we pick up on many different things subconsciously- like tone, accent, and idiomatic usage. I assume you learned English by supplementing grammar with native usage. A real world example of this is listening to Germans who learned English later in life grammatically. They'll speak English at a slightly higher pitch than native English speakers. Also, their tonal pronunciation will be slightly off.\n\nYou just happened to pick up the natural pitch of English. I hope this makes sense.",
                "I'll answer the best I can as someone who studied Linguistics for years (with a focus on accent/dialect work).\n\nEach language or dialect obviously operates around a specific set of rules. For example, those in the south U.S. can sound lazier and flatter while New England dwellers can sound rushed or sharp. Each language comes with it's own pitch and ability to emphasize.\n\nThe most famous example of pitch change would be analyzing the Americans and the English. Americans get louder when they mean something or get angry, whereas the English use the pitch of the speech to emphasize importance. (In other words, watch them yell on SNL and watch them get high pitched voices on Monty Python).\n\nThese are cultural identifiers dealing with pitch, volume, speed etc. Spanish languages often naturally speak much faster (words per second) than English speakers, who speak faster than most Scandinavian citizens. \n\nTo answer your question: German is a more laborious language to speak, (more muscles used to make the sounds, etc) and this could lead to the dropping of pitch (as well as any cultural influence).",

                "Time to shine: \n\nMyographies allow us to see the tension in the muscles involved in the phonation process. \nI have seen cases in which informants speaking in my mother tongue showed in their mother tongue (Spanish) a much higher tension than when they were speaking in English.\nEnglish speakers (Native and non native) show lower levels of myological activity in their vocal tract. \n\nI am a Linguistics student (specialized in Experimental Phonetics) that has worked in a phonetics laboratory for 3 years doing research on Laryngectomized patients Speech."

After they log in, Salesforce redirects the browser to whatever url my app wants. The problem is that my app is not a website, it's an exe running on the user's computer. So how would the web browser open a url in my app?\n\nSimple. My app is running a micro-webserver on some random port. So the url my app tells Salesforce to call back when login is successful is something like \"_URL_0_\".\n\nNow, if you know anything about networking, you'll be asking \"Wait, wouldn't that just tell Salesforce to call Salesforce?\" Nope. The url is called from the browser on the local machine and it sends the request to the local machine which is picked up by my app. It's really damn handy, so long as the OAuth2 provider allows it. (Facebook doesn't, Salesforce does.)\n\nSo basically, the website's Javascript sends a request to \"_URL_1_[some port number\\]\" and does different things based on the response (or lack of response). If the app is installed, it can respond to the request. If the app is not installed, there's no response and the website can detect this.\n\nEdit: .Net developers who are more interested in this: Google \"_URL_2_.httplistener\""

It's kind of like the Loch Ness monster in Scotland, most Scots don't honestly believe it exists but as long as tourists come and take pictures, have a good time and buy souvenirs everybody is happy. That Elf School you talk about is more of a tourist trap if anything, I'm not gonna bash it since it's cool that tourists can learn about Icelandic folklore as it can be very fascinating, but it's not based in actual academia. There have been some cases of roads swaying around rocks where reportedly elves live, but that's more about preserving Icelandic literary tradition than actually worrying about the well-being of said mythical beings. Iceland doesn't really have many historical sites because natural phenomena like earthquakes and volcanoes have consistently destroyed them (plus, not many events of historical importance have happened in Iceland, honestly) and until the 20th century people lived in houses [like this](_URL_2_), not built to last for hundreds of years obviously. So the \"historical\" sites of Iceland are usually rooted in the [sagas](_URL_1_) or folklore. So if a certain cliff is mentioned in a folk story that is supposed be a troll that turned to stone (they turn to stone when exposed to sunlight), people want to preserve that cliff and visit it and go \"hey, there's the troll\" but don't actually believe that it was literally a troll once. Same goes with rocks supposedly inhabited by elves. It's just nice to keep them around if possible.\n\nNow, I'm not saying that NO ONE believes in elves. There are kooky people everywhere in the world that believe in ghosts, myths and new age mumbo jumbo but a belief in elves does not play a role in daily life in Iceland and is really much more noticeable for tourists than the locals. I've always found it interesting how the myth of the elves, has lived on until the present day when there are so many other creatures from Icelandic folklore that don't get talked about much. Like the [skoffín](_URL_4_), [urðarköttur](_URL_3_) or the ever sneaky [marbendill](_URL_0_), you don't want him to get you while rowing your boat. Maybe it's because the elves are beautiful and pure while most of the other mythical beings are creepy as fuck."

If you see enough ads for VISA when you go to get a credit card you think 'hmm VISA seems pretty big, maybe I should get  VISA'.  Or you want a soft drink and think 'hmmm coke seems pretty popular'. \n\nWith google you pay to be top of the list in search rankings (this is an auction process, so highest bidder for a given search term gets the top spot).  On facebook you pay to show up in the feed or on the strip on the right.  \n\nSome of the companies who you see advertising have basically no business, and no money, but for a few thousand dollars in advertising they can get a few tens of thousands in business.  The perks of large data sets.  If only one in a million people buy something but you are advertising to 900 million people well, you have 900 customers.  The price is then a matter of cheap enough to justify whatever the number actually is.  ",

It's still done today, but mostly for aesthetic purposes.\n- For Greek Fire no composition was passed down, but we can get the same effects using Napalm.",
                "Because we don't try to, because we can do better stuff today. We do not need their exact recipes/methods, because we do it better.\n\nOur concretes is plenty good enough, our munitions are way more powerful than Greek fire and Damascus steel was simply a way to compensate for crappy raw material and uneven heating.",
                "It's not that we can't reproduce them technologically, it's that the exact method or recipe was lost to history, so we can't make the exact same thing.\n\n & #x200B;\n\nTake the roman concrete. If you look at a map of Volcanoes in Europe you will see that there is barely any. There is some on Greek Island, but the only concentrations on mainland are in Italy or in Turkey. That's the key to the Roman concrete, because it's a natural concrete using volcanic ash. Something that you can't really do in most of the rest of the world, because of the lack of volcanoes. Concrete today is artificial, meaning we use rocks and minerals that we find pretty much everywhere and use an process of heating to transform it into Portland concrete. It's not as good as Roman concrete, but you can do it anywhere in any quantity, while roman concrete can only be made from Volcanic Ash that is limited geographically and in quantity. The exact recipe of the Roman concrete isn't known, but we figure out the Ash thing and today we use those and other additive that we discovered since then to make really good concrete. Today we can make better concrete than the Roman, but we can also make lesser concrete that is cheaper and allow you to make more building. We make the concrete we need, while Roman only had the choice of volcanic ash concrete.\n\n & #x200B;\n\nFor Greek fire, we have only some description of it, but we don't know what it was exactly. There is some theories about what was the composition, but what is for sure, our current Napalm is way more effective than Greek Fire was. We also most like know how to make Greek Fire, we simply don't know if it is Greek fire or not. For example, some think that Greek Fire was saltpetre, which would make Greet Fire some early gunpowder weapon. We know how to make that and we make it better, but we don't know if Greek Fire really was saltpetre or something else.\n\n & #x200B;\n\nWe have a similar situation for Damascus Steel. We can do better steel today, but Damascus Steel was some damn good steel for their time. It took centuries until modern metallurgy was able to create steel as good and eventually better. The exact method is lost to history, but several reverse engineering were done over the year and those gave pretty good damn steel too. We just don't know if any of them are really the same as the one use for Damascus Steel. In addition, most our steel today is for construction and so we make the cheapest steel possible for what we need, so yes Damascus steel is stronger than our average construction steel today, but that's not the only type of steel we can make.\n\n & #x200B;\n\nThere is a lot of romanticisation of those old material from the past. Truth is most of their fame come from the fact that we lost their method to history and if we really know what the recipe was, we barely would use it outside of some novelty items and certainly not on a large scale.",
                "Because recipes have to be almost exactly followed to the letter to the slightest detail for them to produce equal results every time.\nFor example, cooking. There are differences in the ways that everyone cooks eggs or steaks and they are noticeable, even if they were following the same recipe all the time. Sure, there are better or worse recipes or methods but it would not be \"that\" recipe. \n\nThe case of the previous materials is that the were made with specific tools, methods \"handmade\"and materials specific to that era and because the materials were or methods were not specified, we cant replicate it with exactitude nowadays, not even with machines. \n\nAlthough we cant replicate it, we can make do similar products or even better stuff. For example,  nowadays instead of greek fire, we have thermite,  and molotov cocktails, (gasoline and oil), and napalm, all used in war.\n\nI conclude my post saying that because of dire needs,  we did not had time to replicate and search for lost recipes and had to make do with what we had in hand.

                "Well this all depends on when and where you are talking about.  I imagine the answer would be significantly different for Ancient China as opposed to Ancient Rome, which would in turn be different from Ancient Mexico.  Given how broad the topic can be, I'm going to just provide a small snippet of how vigilante justice operated in a specific time and place before professional police forces existed.  \n\nFor example in Anglo-Saxon England, which is admittedly stretching the definition of ancient, vigilantism was more or less the \"default\" of conflict resolution between equal members of society.  There was no real distinction between vigilante justice and \"official\" justice.  Especially in the Early Anglo-Saxon period our ideas of objective justice and an independent judiciary/police force just simply did not exist.  Justice and revenge were extremely interlinked and the line between official prosecution and a lord taking justice \"into his own hands\" was significantly blurrier than we might imagine.  Much scholarly ink has been spilled on the role of kings and their royal law codes in attempting to crack down on the feuds and disputes of their subjects.  There has been a long standing assumption int he field that the Anglo-Saxon kings were moving in the direction of centralization of power and an increasing monopoly on the prosecution of wrong doers, taking power out of the hands of rival lords who would rather their disputes be settled among themselves.  While this view is somewhat teleological, it is somewhat true in the broad strokes.  \n\nFor certain crimes this was not necessarily the trend.  Catching thieves in the act of theft, or chasing them down, was a devolved power, and very little \"official\" input was required for executing thieves, especially repeat offenders, from the time of England's unification onward.  Other transgressions were different.  There were numerous restrictions and exceptions and possible outcomes for murder for example.  There could be any number of mitigating circumstances that would lessen the fine/penalty/penance paid for the crime such as whether the person murdered had harmed their murderer's relatives.  But all of these permutations were still far removed from a centralized approach that royal figures might have wanted to implement.  \n\nMany scholars argue that the early Anglo-Saxon law codes were essentially efforts by the kings to preempt the cycles of feud and revenge that would result from transgressions by insisting on a royal presence in the paying of weregild, the amount of payment due to a slighted party.  Many law codes provide for the involvement of royally appointed figures in the legal process, but this is misleading.  Although royal law codes make provisions for reeves and sheriffs, we should not associate these figures with out later understandings of law enforcement.  These figures were not necessarily a proto-police force as the name sherriff might imply, but instead royally appointed figures, or people acting under the auspices of royal authority, but in practice there seems to have been little effort at ensuring their objectivity.  indeed Lambert posits that often in the case of a lord or other prominent figure that had committed a crime, the only person in the area who would be capable of putting together a force capable of executing justice on them was another lord, not the king's representatives.  Later on in the Anglo-Saxon period, other practices such as banishment, ordeals, penance, and executions would come to play an increasing role in the prosecution of wrongdoing.  But none of these ever really rose to the level of a police force, indeed Thomas Lambert points out that often times it was the aggrieved party acting on the orders of the royal figures (or claiming to), making this a system of legitimized vigilantism.  Lambert concludes that over time the Anglo-Saxon kings were able to supersede the rights claimed by feud prone lords, but this was a long and involved process that was only somewhat complete by the time of the Norman conquest."

                "There are a couple of things going on here.  It's a very complex problem and I can only gesture at elements of it. \n\n1. Germany has gotten a lot of bad press lately for its EU politics, in which it has been playing bad cop during the Greece debacle.  Taking in refugees is an astoundingly good PR move.\n\n2. Germany actually can take in refugees. It has a uniquely strong economy in a Europe still recovering from massive economic turmoil and its market and welfare state can absorb them.\n\n3. Germany actually *needs* new blood.  Germans do not replace themselves in sufficient numbers (get boning, Germans, seriously. What are you, pandas?) and the country has long relied on guestworkers to supply necessary labour.  Its welfare state and pension plans will be truly messed up if they don't keep bringing in immigrants.\n\n4. Because of Germany's terrible history, the country does feel a moral obligation to do better--and so there actually is political will to take them in. \n\nEdit: Thanks so much for the gold! I'm going to go gift an equivalent amount (and then some) to a charity that looks after refugees or Syrian War victims. Any preferred suggestions?\n\nEdit 2: I'll be making a donation to the [International Rescue Committee](_URL_0_). It was founded Germans, including Albert Einstein, during one of the country's darkest years and so feel's kind of appropriate. The IRC has been helping refugees and victims of war and instability ever since.  I hope some of you fine folks donate, too. Thanks /u/ImOnTheLoo for the suggestion. ",
                "tl;dr answer: Money.

They are also really good about teaching skilled labor, something the US needs to replicate.",
                "German here - another point which hasn't been mentioned: \n\nThe Neo-Nazi Right is growing at an alarming rate in Germany, anti-immigrant marches are on the up, and an abhorrent number of arson attacks have been made on temporary housing for asylum seekers, with some even leading to refugee fatalities. \n\nThe vast majority of German's are terrified by this development, and there is a general sentiment that the Right's increasing efforts need to be matched and overpowered by the less-shitty people. There is a general feeling that a point needs to be made about the kind of country that Germany is now, and the kind of ideas we represent. ",
                "You have some good explanations regarding why Germany are so welcoming, the reason why some other countries are so hostile hasn't been mentioned.\n\nMost European countries have a large capacity to take in refugees, the hostility is largely political. The more right-wing parties are doing the usual thing of placing all the ills of their societies at the feet of migrants. Refugees aren't coming to Europe to escape they're just here for a free handout. \n\nIt's similar to Donald Trumps stupid remarks about Mexicans being drug mules and rapists. It creates an \"us v them\" mentality that panders to a certain demographic that enjoys a less analytical approach to reality.",
                "I can tell you why we, Poland, do not want to take any \"refugees\", it is because:\n\n* Most of them don't have any documents/id, you can't tell if certain person is really a refugee from war zone, economic migrant, or hidden ISIS terrorist\n\n* Because we simply don't have money - millions of Poles live below standard of poor, often hungry, saving on everything.\n\n* Because most of those \"refugees\" dont want to go to Poland anyway, they know they will get a lot more social benefits in Germany/Other countries than in Poland. In Poland they receive little and they need to hard work to get more. About 95% refugees with asylium in Poland escaping to other countries like Sweden.\n\n* Because we dont owe them anything, Poland never had any colonies in Africa or anywhere else, we never enslaved Black people (even more - we helped them getting free from French occupation in Napolean times in Haiti: _URL_0_). Wester Europe did such things, if they feel obligated to help those ppl - allright, but we dont have any moral debt to them.\n\n* Becuse we want to protect our cultural heritage. Muslim families has avg. 5 kids, while Polish - 1,3. It's pretty similar in rest of EU countries. By taking so much immigrants, Germany (also France and Sweden) will become muslim country in the next 20-30 years. There is danger that Islamic Sharia Law will replace democracy when they finally become majority in 20-30 years, which means for ex.: no free elections, no beer in the park, no womens behind the wheel, and head cutted off if you insult their prophet. We simply don't want that in Poland.\n\nI hope it helps understand our attitude, and sorry for my bad english.",

It's the only time in my entire life living in Canada that I was the victim of random street violence.\n\nSo I can understand their reservations.\n\nAt the same time as living in \"Little Lebanon\", I had a few good friends who were Arabic, but they were what you could call \"normal\" immigrants from Lebanon and Jordan.\n\nThey applied, had educations, job prospects, money saved up, they were prepared for the move and made a smooth transition. I've also had personal and professional relationships with immigrants from Ethiopia and Haiti.\n\nThe difference between the immigrant versus refugee interactions was staggering. I don't have the answers to how to solve the problem, but I do understand people's reservations behind taking refugees in to their own back yard.",

In Switzerland, gun laws explicitly contain a list of nationalities that are not allowed to own firearms, just like that, zero fucks given whether that's discrimination or not.",

                "As a European (British) I'm getting more concerned with immigration.  I'd consider myself a pretty liberal guy, but even I can admit that it's no accident that more and more people in Europe are growing uneasy with taking in refugees/migrants.  For me personally, it has to do with religion and cultural differences.  There are large Muslim communities in the UK that seem totally separated from the rest of society.  It's almost like they live in their own country within a country.  They are having a lot more children and their population is growing at quite an alarming rate.  They go to all-Muslim schools, or even worse \"Faith Schools\" that teach what they want to teach, often things that are at odds with a western democratic society.  What we're getting is an ever widening segregation between the British public and the Muslim communities.  This is breeding a lot of unrest, fear and conflict.  A lot of mistakes have been made in Europe in regards to this issue and it's only going to get worse.  There will be a breaking point.  \n\nFor what it's worth, I'm not in any way anti-immigration, and I would be supportive towards taking in refugees, BUT ONLY IF once they get here they were put into social programs that would help them integrate fully within British society instead of forming isolated communities which would only make the current problem worse.

However, the majority also believes, that people who are in immidiate danger, like being in a war area need to be protected.\n\nThe pictures and videos you see, where people cheer that refugees arrive, just represent a small portion of German people. I do not have a problem with this, everyone can do whatever he likes, but I see problems with the message this send to other refugees (together with Merkels statements).\n\nIt is a fact that the majority of the refugees coming here, will never integrate and will never be economically independent from social welfare. Also, Germany is an expensive country, so even if they get 400 Euros per months, they cannot save so much (legally) that it really worth for them being here instead of other European countries. SO eventually the expectations they have when seeing those welcoming people and politicians are not the reality.",

                "It could also have to do with the Dublin regulation. The [Dublin Regulation](_URL_0_) forces refugees to stay in the country that they land in, however it has currently been suspended. Because Germany is not a border country with any of countries the immigrants are migrating from, they can currently take more immigrants. Mix this with Germany having one of the strongest economies in the EU and it makes them one of the best suited to help in the crisis. Countries like Greece have been hit hard, seeing a 50% increase in the illegal border crossings in the last year. Germany also has better Immigration facilities. They are better equipped to handle large groups of immigrants. Have better systems to differentiate between who is an economic immigrant and who is a refugee seeking asylum. Countries like Greece and Hungary are facing health crisis with so many immigrants being detained in one place. \nHope this sheds some light on the situation. ",

(They are forcing Austerity Measures across the board). \n\n3) Germany's Birth rate is 1.38 and you need a birth rate of 2.2 to maintain a countries population. They actually need to have immigrants or they will collapse as the country ages. \n\n4) Germany wants to avoid anything that even resembles the racist actions taken during the Nazis Era. This is a very big fear for the Government and many citizens in German. ",

It's a powerhouse and they need to be proud of what they've achieved. They should (as we all should) bring in their fair share of refugees but they need to lose the apologetic nature of their dialogues and move on up. They are muscle, they just forgot how to use it. ",

Something that wasn't very obvious before the fall of the Berlin wall because the political pressures of the time still maintained a pro american/capitalist ruling class and especially media. These needed the usual ideological justification.\nThis I think is something that is quite rapidly disintegrating. \n\nFrom the hard left's point of view, german culture is not accepted as being a proper or 'non-fascist culture' at all, thus it has nothing to fear from being put under pressure by constant dilution.

Those who apply for asylum and actually manage to get it granted will be allowed to stay. In the meantime all the refugees will be granted a 'duldung' visa, which is a temporary stay visa, 6 months unless something has changed.

                "Because I have studied Estonian history and I am Estonian myself, I can mainly give an answer about the situation in Estonia.\n\nAs far as their numbers go, Baltic-Germans were never very numerous. According to the Russian Empire Census  there were only 180,000 Baltic Germans in Russia's Baltic provinces (moderen day Estonia and Latvia (except Latgale region)). In comparison at that time (1897) population of those provinces was arround 2,4 million. That means that Germans weren't there in high-numbers.\n\nWhile Germans weren't very numerous, they had control over most cities. During that timeline (16th-19th century) most prominent cities in modern-day Estonia (Tallinn, Tartu, Pärnu, Viljandi, Narva) still followed Hanseatic laws. That meant that city officials were chosen up until early 19th century only amongst the German merchants. That meant that city was run by Germans and was mainly meant for Germans. That of course attracted Germans from countryside and from abroad. Until industrialisation took place in early 19th century most cities had German or sometimes Scandinavian high-end crafters (bakers, goldsmith, shoemakers etc) and merchants, while most Estonians worked as less valued crafters (f.e builders, butchers, gravediggers etc). Cities became more Estonian after industrialisation started to take off. During that time period local peasentry was freed from serfdom and thanks to industrialisation those peasents were able to become laborers in newly created factories. This pattern was common ammongst the towns that were given city rights before Russia conquered modern-day Estonia. Most of them were trading towns and that is why those towns had mainly Germans or otherwise non-Estonian population. During Russian rule Russia also created few administrative and later even few industrious towns. Most notably such towns were Võru and Paide (Võru gained and Paide regained it's city rights during rule of Catherine the Great). Because such towns didn't had historical precedent for German population, they ended up having mainly Estonian population even during 18th century.\n\nOutside of cities, most Germans were landowners/manorholders and because of that they ended up living far away from each other in their castles or manors. That is why outside of cities there weren't any significant Germanic majority areas. \n\nMost likely modern-day Latvia (except Latgale region) experienced similar situation as modern-day Estonia because both areas were under German jurisdiction and administration. This special status lasted until the beginning of the russification in the Baltic Provinces in 1876. \n\nI don't know much about Lithuanian history and because of that I can't give an answer about the situation in Lithuania. \n\nHopefully my answer was helpful :)\n"

                "Can't speak for normal radio, but if you're talking about XM-Sirius Radio, it's because they are data compressed. XM-Sirius uses digital signals to send the audio to your car. They only have a certain amount of signal bandwidth to use and this has to get split up between all their channels. In order to have a higher number of channels, they use a smaller bandwidth per channel. The amount of bandwidth they use is not enough to send the audio in its normal quality. They have to re-encode it a lower quality in order to make it fit in the bandwidth for each channel. ",
                "Its the equalization and compression they put the signal through. They get rid of some of the really low and really high pitches in the equalization because they're less important. Then they compress it, making the loud sounds quieter and the quiet sounds louder. These steps help to get the most sound out of a weak signal. The cymbols make sounds that are both high pitched and loud, so both the eq and compression remove part of the sound. The \"s\" sound you asked about may be a different effect, created by bad microphone placement. Essentially it's the sound of the person blowing air into the mic. When you're recording something with a sound engineer they'll listen for this, move the mic to fix this, and record again, but you don't have that opportunity live. The eq and compression probably make this even more noticeable "

                "By halves I am going to assume this is referring to the administrative split of the Roman Empire into East and West performed by the Emperor Theodosius I in 395 AD (at his death). \n\nWhile the two halves of the Empire after 395 AD increasingly went separate ways politically, they still largely thought of themselves as part of a greater whole. There was certainly rivalry between Emperors and generals from the two halves but nothing that came to full scale conflict. In fact, the Eastern Roman Empire (ERE) provided military assistance to the Western Roman Empire (WRE) as late as 467/468 AD during the disastrous invasion of Vandalic Carthage/Libya. The WRE would officially cease to exist in 476 AD. \n\nThe closest the WRE and ERE came to blows was during a rather complicated time period where Flavius Stilicho, the highest ranking general in the west, attempted to use the Visigoths and their king Alaric to threaten the ERE over territory in Illyricum. Stilicho didn't live long enough to follow through on this and his end goals/plans for Alaric and the Visigoths are not entirely clear. \n\n**Edit** thanks /u/Guckfuchs for correcting me, I had completely forgot about the succession crisis after Honorius' death. The Eastern Emperor Theodosius II did send an army to remove Johannes (John) from the Western Throne and installed Valentinian III, his cousin. It is an important and interesting point to note that Theodosius bothered naming a new Emperor in the West, rather than simply claiming sole control over the entire Roman Empire. \n\n*History of the Wars* Procopius\n\n*Historia Nova* Zosimus",
                "I’d like to add a small correction to u/mrleopards ‘ and u/WispyWalrus ‘ accounts. There was at least one instance of armed conflict between the two halves of the empire after 395 AD. In August 423 AD the western emperor Honorius died. Throughout his reign there had been several moments when both halves of the empire nearly came to blows even though the east had been ruled first by his brother Arcadius and then his nephew Theodosius II. Honorius himself had never much control over governance. Instead the west was ruled by powerful military figures like Stilicho and later Flavius Constantius. The later even rose to co-emperor in the west. Both men seem to have been close to starting a war with the east at times but both also died before anything could come about. And it had always been Honorius who had guaranteed the legitimacy of the western government as he was a member of the dynasty that had been ruling both parts of the Roman Empire for more than half a century. \n\nSo when he finally died in 423 AD that posed something of a problem for the western elites: they didn’t have any members of the Valentinian-Theodosian family left which could have ascended to the throne. After a few months of negotiations they agreed to elevate a senior civil servant, the *primicerius notariorum* Johannes, who became emperor in November of the same year. He had the support of powerful generals like the *cura palatii* Aetius. Others however were much colder towards him and so his control over the west was sketchy at best. The most important opposition towards Johannes came from the east. The court of emperor Theodosius II wasn’t thrilled to see the western throne pass to someone who wasn’t part of the dynasty. Johannes and his supporters certainly hoped to come to an agreement with Constantinople but when Theodosius elevated his cousin Valentinian III to the purple in October 424 AD it became clear that civil war was inevitable.\n\nValentinian who was just a five year old boy at the time was the son of Galla Placidia, the half-sister of Honorius and Arcadius. She had been an influential figure at the western court until court intrigues had forced her to relocate to Constantinople in 422. Now she and her son returned to the west at the head of an East Roman army commanded by the general Ardaburius. After some initial successes disaster struck in the form of a storm that hid the East Roman navy. Ardaburius himself was captured and taken prisoner at Ravenna. However his son Aspar who had been in command of the cavalry and was leading them into Italy by land could again change the fortunes of war. He was able to take Ravenna, free his father and deliver Johannes to Galla Placidia and Valentinian III at Aquileia. When Aetius arrived in Italy with a substantial contingent of Hunnic soldiers his emperor had already been executed and the civil war was effectively over. Aetius was able to come to an agreement with the new regime and would later rise to become the dominant military figure in the west. The hero of the war, Aspar, achieved a similar ascent in the east.\n\nThere are some famous late antique monuments that are connected to this rather short civil war. At Ravenna Galla Placidia founded the church of San Giovanni Evangelista. The mosaic decoration of its apse is unfortunately lost but according to an early medieval source it commemorated Placidia’s miraculous rescue from the storm that had hit the eastern army. It also featured several portraits of members of her family, the dynasty who’s rule over the west had been restored in 425. In the east it is possible that the Golden Gate, the huge marble main entry into Constantinople, was also constructed to commemorate victory in this civil war. It was originally topped by a bronze statue of Theodosius riding a chariot drawn by four elephants. Although the emperor had never left his capital throughout the events he was seemingly still able to propagate himself as the true victor of the war.\n\nFinally, to echo u/shlin28 here: It is important to remember that those events as well as similar wars that preceded them shouldn't be seen as conflicts between two distinct states but as civil wars over the leadership in one unified empire. Theodosius and his generals weren’t fighting an enemy state but a usurper who had deprived his family of its right to rule both halves of the empire."

The H proteins are rather shaped like a stalk of broccoli, with the stalk at the viral membrane and the bunchy part exposed where antibodies can recognize it.\n\nInsertional mutagenesis studies, where 15 nucleotides are inserted into various parts of the hemagluttinin “broccoli”, show that influenza virus is very tolerant on the extra corresponding 5 amino acids compared to measles, especially in the bunchy region that is most available to targeting antibodies.  Viral outgrowth assays show influenza is able to infect and proliferate just fine with inserted mutations (and evade the antibody immune response) while measles virus does not tolerate insertions; thus part of the reason why the measles vaccine has been so long-lasting, but the influenza vaccine is much shorter lived.",

                "You say “viruses like influenza”, but in fact it’s not viruses *like* influenza, it’s *only* influenza that does this. Influenza is unique in the virus world in its ability to evolve to avoid population immunity. Technically, influenza doesn’t mutate fast than other RNA viruses, but its surface proteins are more tolerant of mutations than other viruses are. See my answer in [Why of some viruses mutate faster than others](_URL_2_) for details and references. \n\nIf you think about the vast majority of viral vaccines (measles, mumps, rubella, Yellow Fever, polio, etc etc etc) they do *not* need to be updated annually. Even RNA viruses like measles and polio are antigenically very stable, in spite of having mutation rates that are very similar to influenza’s, and they haven’t needed to have their vaccines updated in the decades since they were introduced.\n\nThe question didn’t specifically ask about SARS-CoV-2, but since the other answers immediately turned to it ... Coronaviruses in general have slightly slower mutation rates than influenza, but they’re still very high. However, while they can and do readily accumulate mutations ([_URL_1_](_URL_0_) shows hundreds of mutations that the virus has made over the past few months) the default assumption - for good reasons - is that these mutations are neutral and don’t affect the virus function or antigenicity. \n\nIf we look at the four endemic human coronaviruses, they show some signs of slow antigenic change, which hints that coronaviruses *might* be able to tolerate *some* changes in their proteins, but clearly not to anywhere near the extent of influenza.  If we have to guess (and without data it’s mainly a guess) it seems likely that a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 will be effective for many years, perhaps 5-10 years, before the virus drifts enough that it might need an update. Maybe not quite as good as measles, but hopefully much better than influenza.",
                "Two things about influenza. First it is an RNA virus (compared to DNA viruses). RNA viruses are more error prone when they replicate so they generate mutations faster. \n\nSecond, unlike most viruses, it’s genome is segmented, that is its genome isn’t a single strand, but it’s genes come on different strands. If it coinfects a host with another flu strain they can exchange genes easily, creating another source of variability/mutation. \n\nIn this way human flu can gain characteristics of avian flu, for example, crating a virus humans haven’t gained any immunity to yet.",
                "The reason is because influenza has what is known as an \"error prone polymerase\".  Influenza's genome is made of RNA, not DNA, and it comes with instructions for copying it's own genome.  That comes in the form of RNA that makes a protein called \"RNA Polymerase\".  The RNA polymerase in influenza makes way more mistakes at copying RNA than our polymerase does, which leads to lots of mutations.  \n\nYou might think that in order to do that, it would be best if influenza didn't make a lot of mistakes in copying it's genome.  A lot of mistakes means that there are a lot of mutant virus particles produced that are total duds and can't generate a new infection.  But some of the copies of the virus have a mutated version in a surface protein.  \"H1\", in fact, is the name of one of the surface proteins. If that mutation causes the surface protein to have a slightly different shape, it might be enough to help that virus escape our immune system.\n\n & #x200B;\n\nIt seems that SARS-CoV2 does NOT have an error prone polymerase.",
                "Reassortment. Some viruses have multiple genomic parts, especially RNA viruses. Influenza segments dont evolve and mutate more rapidly, but since there are eight genomic segment strands, these can recombine in new ways. So you can get an avian HA with a pig NA with a human PA, or  < evil chord >  the Triple Reassortant. Now you have bits of virus present from three different source species, and if they work, maybe they brought in a completely new antigen to the human species experience. The ones on the outside of the virus change at a different rate than the ones in the inside, since they face host pressure differently.\n\nPolyproteins. Now lets say all your virus proteins are in one genomic strand, and all the coding regions are jammed together, in a polyprotein, like for Hepatitis C. Instead of like flu, you have all your eggs in one basket, and cant change one protein without impact the whole strain. Then the whole thing is locked together. Flavivirus doesnt evolve rapidaly at all. Almost all the outbreak strains from the last west african pandemic are 99% conserved and alike one another.\n\nSo when you talk of evolution, you can talk about mutation rate, or site subsitution rate more accurately. Or just about one protein or one site. Some substitutions are silent. And, the end result is always important- whether the Strain is itself different. Different parts change at different rates. I think what you are asking is about the strain change rate. \n\nA lot of change rates contribute to that.",
                "DNA viruses are more stable than RNA viruses and thus don't mutate as frequently. Especially if the DNA virus is dsDNA (double stranded). This will allow for repairing of one strand and thus reduce mutations. This is the case for HIV. If you have an ssRNA (single stranded) virus, then it is MUCH more likely to mutate as they aren't as stable as DNA and dont really have a good repair mechanism.\n\n3 outcomes of mutations: \n\n1. Virus become less virulent (good)\n2. Nothing happens\n3. Virus becomes more virulent (bad)"

And when the deployment is over you have to move everyone and everything back and deal with sorting it all out.\n\nMy simple math on moving and housing 5000 people is as follows.  5000 people need food, transport, and housing for 42 days.  Figure it takes $300 a day per person.  Simple math:  5000 people x $300 a day x 42 days = 63,000,000.

But on a much larger scale.\n\nThe only real difference is that you don't send him with a regular flight. You send him in your own airplane, among a few hundred others. That airplane goes back and forth for a few days.\n\nAnd when he gets there, you have already sent a few vehicles there in advance. With mechanics, because with that amount of vehicles, shit will break down in a pretty constant flow.\n\nAnd you don't bother with hotels. Because you have your own mobile living quarters that some people have been spending a week or two setting up in neat rows before you arrive.

You literally bring people who's sole job it is to drive off with trucks every day to fetch fuel and food.\n\nIn other words, if they send 5000 soldiers, they'll send at least a few hundred others who's job it is to make it easier for the actual fire-arm-holding soldiers to do their job. And that cost stacks up too. (in reality, though, if they send 5000 men and women to the border, around 4600 of them are actually doing what they are there to do. The others do things that has to be done for that main goal to continue to happen for more than a day or two. No-one is keen enough on doing the governments bidding to do it on an empty stomach.

Rather they were revisions to the pre-existing Meiji constitution, which had been intentionally based upon a synthesis of the British parliamentary model along with Prussian militarism. \n\nThe Potsdam Declaration, which defined the terms of the Japanese surrender at the end of the Second World War, called for the dismantling of Japanese militarism and re-establishment of democratic freedoms. It did not require a totally new constitution. \n\nEven if the U.S. had desired a completely new constiturion, it likely would have looked to the British model for its constitutional monarchy. A major concession the U.S. had allowed Japan in their surrender terms was preservation of the emperor. But they didn't want the emperor to be allowed to overrule the will of the Japanese people in a future government. So the U.S. allowed the emperor to continue his rule in a largely ceremonial capacity. This allowed the Japanese to preserve kokutai - the concept that Japan's emperors united them to their ancient past in an unbroken line of succession - without compromising the allies' demand for a truly democratic government. \n\nHere is a great source for many key documents and commentaries about the establishment of Japan's constitution: [Birth of the Constitution of Japan](_URL_0_)",

Salt in the soil is best washed away by fresh water, but because this clay / silt layer is relatively impermeable, the filtration process, called *leaching*, is slow. The duration of salt contamination will depend on the level of drainage and precipitation rates for that particular area so difficult to generalise.",

For instance, after the 1953 north sea flood.\n\nFor the Dutch soil, all salt from flooding is washed away within 1-4 years. This depends on sveral factors, such as duration of flood, dept of the groundwater level, amount of moisture in de ground above groundwater level, precipitation etc\n\nFor some recovery nature needs some help. The (NaCl) salt water also worsens the mineral structure of older clay. Even if the salt itself is already washed away. Naturally the clay could take up to 8 years to recover. Fertilizing with gypsum is enough to repair this and this pays for itself in the first year.\n\nA sweet water flood costs 1 year of production, a salt water flood generally 2-3 years.With gypsum that 3 years can be reduced to 2 years of loss.  The second year some salt-resistant crops can be grown, so the economic damage could be a bit less. In fact, for weaker fields the silt from the inundation increases fertility in the long term.",

Because the sheer mass of salt needed to contaminate a single field sounds unrealistic to acquire, transport, and acquire.

Probably from saltwater flooding I guess, seeing how it kills agriculture for a few years.  Still, I'm not sure how many had experience with that, as tsunamis are rare and the bulk of agriculture is closer to freshwater flooding probs than salt water.",

Things are gradually getting more expensive and more difficult to grow. But by far the biggest problem is humans nature rather than adapting or admitting defeat we are constantly looking for quick fixes. An example, a farmer is using a desalination device to remove salt water from the well water. The desal water goes on the plants and the runoff from the device (as it is inland) back onto the soil (away from crops). The desal is often mixed with well water to make it less salty and to reduce the cost. There is an awful lot of good intentions but you feel for some of the growers"

                "There's a shadowy story that's emerged from North Korea concerning Kim Jong-il that's given historians some pause. Unfortunately, we're probably decades past the point when we could confirm it with total confidence, and that's *if* we could have confirmed it at all. Not only does it belong to a period that the North Korean government has heavily mythologized, but most (if not all) of the people who would be in a position to confirm it have since died. There are probably still members of the Kim family around who know for sure, but they're not very talkative people.\n\nAnyway, it's a pretty good guide en miniature to the difficulties of assembling North Korean history.\n\n**Yura and Shura:** What most North Koreans aren't told is that Kim Jong-il (the eldest son of, and later successor to, Kim il-Sung) wasn't born in North Korea at all. After about 5 years of harassing the Japanese in Manchuria as part of a Chinese-led force, his father had to bail out of the fight when things got hot, and he fled for the Soviet Union with his then-wife, Kim Jong-suk. Contrary to the official history distributed by the North Korean state, Kim il-Sung never fought in Korea, and in fact sat out World War II. Kim Jong-il was likely born in a Soviet army camp in Siberia in 1942, and he was followed by a little brother in 1944. This little brother's existence is also unknown to most North Koreans, for reasons that will become apparent shortly.\n\nThe two boys were nicknamed Yura and Shura respectively (Russian nicknames for Yuri and Alexander -- and in fact, we only know the younger brother's nickname), and they accompanied their parents back to Korea after World War II ended and the Soviet army descended into the peninsula. The story that concerns us today comes from 1948, when Jong-il would have been 5-6 years old and his brother 3-4. They were said to have been playing in a pond in Pyongyang, and as his younger brother repeatedly tried to climb out of the pond, Jong-il pushed him back in. Shura eventually tottered under the water after another push, was too exhausted to pull himself out, and drowned. Their parents were too late upon the scene to rescue him, shouted at Jong-il for an explanation, and didn't receive one.\n\nSo. If the story is true, then Kim Jong-il killed his younger brother at a very young age. Was it something that should have been a warning sign, as you ask here, or was it simply a family tragedy caused by a child too young to realize what he was doing? I'm not sure I can answer that.\n\nAnd how do we know about this in the first place? The story comes to us via a North Korean official who defected to South Korea in 1960.\n\n**Why it might not be true:** Trying to assemble an accurate narrative about events within North Korea is difficult even under the best of circumstances, because NK's government has a very opportunistic approach to its own history. Events that support the narrative of Kim il-Sung, and secondarily Kim Jong-il, as the great saviors of their nation, are exalted and embellished, if they aren't being made up entirely. Events that do not support this narrative are downplayed at best and erased at worst. That's bad on its own, but the acrimonious relationship between North and South Korea added another layer of complexity. With anything that was filtered through the South Korean government, it was prudent to ask whether they were putting their own spin on the information, or simply not publicizing anything that might have countered it.\n\nThe defector who provided the story arrived in SK about 7 years after the Korean War, in a period when passions and propaganda were running high on both sides of the border. Maybe the guy was telling the truth about a story that was whispered around the upper tier of NK's government. Maybe he was telling a version of the truth and played it up for the benefit of the South Korean intelligence service, which would certainly have loved hearing anything bad about North Korea. Maybe he made a vague reference to a story like it, and SK intelligence filled in the details, as it were. Or maybe he said nothing of the sort and the South Korean government simply made it up. We don't really know.\n\n**Why it might actually be true:** However, historians tend to entertain the defector's story as a serious possibility, even if they don't necessarily believe it means Kim Jong-il was a childhood sociopath. \"Shura\" is curiously absent from all official North Korean histories, but thanks to Soviet army records, we know that he did in fact exist, and that his age in 1948 would have made the defector's story plausible. \n\nKim Jong-il was active in North Korea's government from his early 20s onwards, and he started his career by controlling the country's art and literature scene (he was primarily interested in, and most famous for, the country's movie scene, but it wasn't the only thing he did). Even from an early age, he had absolute control over his personal narrative within North Korea, and he was big on playing up anything that could win him additional sympathy or support from the North Korean populace (e.g., his mother's early death in 1949 -- yes, a year after Shura). Why? Because his position as his father's successor was not (we think) guaranteed until much later. He had an advantage as his father's eldest son, but his step-siblings were born a bit more than a decade after he was, in a time when Kim il-Sung was firmly established as North Korea's absolute ruler and could afford to spend more time with them. Kim Pyong-il, Kim il-Sung's son by the favored wife, Kim Song-ae, was said to be a particular favorite and the most likely rival for the top job. Pyong-il was actually shunted into ambassadorships later in his life, but while Kim Jong-il was working his way up the government ladder and currying favor with Dad, he only saw Pyong-il as a threat against his interests and worked hard to eliminate or minimize it. Arguably the most effective way he did this was by controlling the information given to the public on the Kim family.\n\nSo of the histories that Jong-il approved and published, none of them make any reference to Shura -- it's as if he never existed at all -- and none of them acknowledge that Kim Jong-il had step-siblings. North Koreans are instead presented with a very sanitized story in which Kim il-Sung's only son was:\n\n - born on the sacred Mount Paektu in 1942 (which he wasn't)\n - fired at retreating Japanese at the age of 3 (doubtful), and:\n - tragically lost his mother at the age of 7 (one out of three ain't bad). \n\nIf Shura had died in a genuine accident or in something completely unrelated to Jong-il, it seems reasonable to assume that Jong-il would have played up the tragic circumstances of his brother's death in much the same way that he played up their mother's early death. Instead, silence.\n\nSorry to write so much; I just think it's one of the more interesting (if creepy) quirks in North Korea's history.\n\n**EDIT:** I should probably give an additional detail that makes me think that the defector's story might be true. Dynastic succession wasn't a \"thing\" in Communist governments (Marx had inveighed against the whole notion of inherited power), and people who worked in NK's government in the early 1960s would not necessarily have believed that Kim il-Sung's job would only be passed to a son. Kim Jong-il wasn't yet part of NK's government when the official defected, and even after he became part of the government, he wasn't universally liked. So the official may not have attached the kind of weighty importance to the story that we're inclined to do today, because Jong-il was just a pain-in-the-ass college kid at the time and not necessarily a figure of great destiny in North Korean culture.",
                "If I might, I'd like to take a moment to disagree with the premise of your question, especially the \"Why was this not caught at a young age?\" part. If you take a dictator and start looking at his life history for violent events, you may very well find some. But even *if* (I stress the \"if\"; I haven't done an exhaustive survey) all dictators had violent events in their youth, that doesn't mean that everyone with a violent event in their youth becomes a dictator, which is what your \"why was this not caught\" seems to imply. Many adults will have had violent episodes in their youth, and most of them didn't grow up to become dictators. \n\nThe question about \"things dictators did as kids/teens\" is very interesting, but for the reason outlined above I'd be very careful about using terms such as \"alerted\" and \"caught at a young age\".\n\n*edit: spelling*",

There are two ways they are designed. One is rigid, the other is soft.\n\nThe rigid design is built like the kind of suit that divers use, where the parts are hard and the joints have special hardware that allow them to rotate or bend as needed.\n\nThe soft ones rely on the fabric of the suit hinging the way it needs to by folding. The suits are not actually soft like your clothing is, and they don't stretch like rubber. It's a thick, stiff fabric.",

Those would be a lot smaller and more flexible but have their own issues."

        "selftext": "Taken from wikipedia:\n\n*Some older versions of this rhyme had the word nigger instead of tiger:*\n\n*Eeny, meena, mina, mo,\nCatch a nigger by the toe;\nIf he hollers let him go,\nEena, meena, mina, mo.[3]\nThis version was similar to that reported as the most common version among American schoolchildren in 1888.[10] It was used in the chorus of Bert Fitzgibbon's 1906 song \"Eeny, Meeny, Miny, Mo\":*\n\n*Eeny, Meeny, Miny, Mo,\nCatch a nigger by his toe,\nIf he won't work then let him go;\nSkidum, skidee, skidoo.\nBut when you get money, your little bride\nWill surely find out where you hide,\nSo there's the door and when I count four,\nThen out goes you.[11]*\n\n*It was also used by Rudyard Kipling in his \"A Counting-Out Song\", from Land and Sea Tales for Scouts and Guides, published in 1935.[12] This may have helped popularise this version in the United Kingdom where it seems to have replaced all earlier versions until the late twentieth century.[3]*\n\n*Iona and Peter Opie pointed out in The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes that the word \"nigger\" was common in American folk-lore, but unknown in any English traditional rhyme or proverb.[3] This, combined with evidence of various other versions of the rhyme in the British Isles pre-dating this version, would seem to suggest that it originated in North America, although the apparently American word 'holler' was first recorded in written form in England in the fourteenth century, whereas according to the Oxford English Dictionary the words 'Niger' or 'nigger' were first recorded in England in the sixteenth century with their current disparaging meaning. The 'olla' and 'toe' are found as nonsense words in some nineteenth century versions of the rhyme, and it could possibly be that the original 'Where do all the Frenchmen Go?' (probably originating during one of the periods of Anglo-French warfare) was later on replaced by the earlier version in the United States, using some of the nonsense words*\n\nSource: _URL_0_\n\nI have several questions:\n\n* Are words like \"Eeny\" \"Miny\" \"Skidum\" and \"Skidoo\" complete nonsense for the sake of creating a memorable delivery? What is the purpose of their usage?\n\n* How did the eeny, meeny, miny, moe rhyme begin? Was it a quick rhyme to tell small children, not unlike old pirate songs (ex; sing a song of sixpence, etc.)?\n\n* When the rhyme states \"If he won't work then let him go\" ... \" is this implying a slave should be murdered, if deemed unproductive? Released to hunt the slave? Is there historical significance here?\n\n* When the rhyme states \"But when you get money, your little bride will surely find out where you hide,\" What is this in reference to?\n\n* Why would anyone ever catch another human being by the toe? Or is this also to create a silly rhyme?\n\n* In addition to the now better known substitution of 'tiger' for 'nigger' I can tell you as a small child I definitely heard both iterations which is fascinating to me because I'm only in my 20's - so I'm curious about how the split began. I'd also be curious to hear how common each iteration is and what the origin is?\n\n",

                "I'd just like to say that nonsense syllables at the beginning of counting-out games isn't restricted to English, but actually fairly common in German and Norwegian. [The most popular German ditty begins](_URL_3_) \"Ene mene miste, es rappelt in der Kiste\" -- the first three words are nonsense, but set a rhythm and conveniently rhyme with the next line ('there's commotion in the chest/box'). [The same with the most popular Norwegian one,](_URL_0_) which begins \"Elle melle, deg fortelle\" ('elle melle, telling you') and ends \"snipp, snapp, snute, du er ute\" ('snip-snap snout, you are out') -- which, incidentally, is how you end fairy tales in Norwegian, only with 'the fairy tale' substituted for 'you'. \n\nThere's even some ditties in both German and Norwegian that are almost exclusively nonsense, interspersed with a couple of 'real' lines. [One of the German ones](_URL_2_) begins with what is widely assumed to be a bastarization of the French numbers one through four (\"ong dong dee kader\" for \"un, deux, trois, quatre\"), which makes sense considering it's from a town near the French border. A Norwegian example is [the second one on the wiki page for Norwegian counting-out games](_URL_1_).",
                "This is covered by David Rubin in his 1995 book *Memory in Oral Traditions: the Cognitive Psychology of Epic, Ballads, and Counting-out Rhymes*, chapter 10 (pp. 227-56). \n\nIn the nonsense syllables \"eenie meenie miney mo\", the sound patterns are key to their emergence and longevity (and this also applies to the other examples people have cited here): rhyme, alliteration, and assonance are all strongly self-replicating, self-propagating elements in oral traditions. Note that a single vowel gets repeated five times in the phrase \"eenie meenie miney mo\", and the syllable \"nee\" appears three times. These poetic devices also extend into the middle two lines, which convey a sort of meaning, though there meaning is also an important self-replication device so there's more room for incidental variations: when the first and last lines change, the changes tend to be more systematic, e.g. \"eena deena dina do\".\n\nTextual variations are abundant. Rubin reports 82 variants of the text in a catalog compiled in 1980, with 291 word-changes. He classifies the 291 word-changes as follows:\n\n* replacing most or all of the first and last lines: 41%\n* changes to the word \"tiger\": 25%\n* replacing most or all of the second and third lines: 13%\n* miscellaneous changes: 12%\n* changes to the word \"hollers\": 9%\n\nA higher percentage doesn't indicate more popular variations, but wider variation. For the word \"tiger\" (the second most variable element in the rhyme), he reports the following variants:\n\n* \"n****r\": 56 instances\n* \"tiger\": 9 instances\n* \"neighbor\": 3 instances\n* \"monkey\": 2 instances\n* \"baby\", \"beatnik\", \"feller\", \"lamb\", \"lion\", \"lizard\", \"pig\", \"robber\", \"rooster\", \"schmoo\", blank space: 1 instance each\n\nAgain, number of instances doesn't indicate popularity, but number of variants known. It's pretty obvious that \"n****r\" is a more primary version of the text, with the other variants as replacements to make the text more socially acceptable. Rubin points out that \"tiger\" and \"monkey\" are especially good replacements because they alliterate with \"toe\" and \"mo\" respectively.\n\nSome variants are regional: for example, the word \"hollers\" is routinely replaced by \"squeals\" in Great Britain (he may mean excluding N. Ireland, it's not clear) and New Zealand. Rubin reports a 1979-1980 survey of Duke undergraduates in which the number of variants known came out as follows:\n\n* replacing most or all of the first and last lines: 0%\n* changes to the word \"tiger\": 31%\n* replacing most or all of the second and third lines: 28%\n* miscellaneous changes: 38%\n* changes to the word \"hollers\": 3%\n\nSo in that population the variant \"eenie meenie miney mo\" is practically obligatory, and \"hollers\" is very much the standard. In terms of the relative popularity of alternatives to \"tiger\", here were the number of undergraduates who reported each variant:\n\n* \"tiger\": 73\n* \"monkey\", \"rabbit\": 10 each\n* \"n****r\": 4\n* blank space: 3\n* \"fellow\", \"piggie\": 2 each\n* \"blackbird\", \"bunny\", \"buyer\", \"chicken\", \"doggie\", \"froggie\", \"wiffer waffer\": 1 each\n\nAt pages 246-7 Rubin gets on to the history of the changes. Here's the incidence of \"n****r\" over time:\n\n* up to 1939: 84%\n* 1940s and 1950s: 62%\n* 1960s and 1970s: 37%\n\nSo \"n****r\" starts to get replaced around WWII, and the rate of replacement increased dramatically during the Civil Rights movement. This result is not very surprising, but it's nice to know for sure. At every stage in the history of the rhyme, Rubin notes, \n\n >  Using a both a comparison across all versions published in the folklore literature and a detailed analysis of two samples of *Eenie Meenie* collected 90 years apart, there were no trend that violated the constraints of the two rhymes\n\nin terms of their self-propagating phonetic characteristics. That is to say, however much the rhyme changes, the importance of rhyme, alliteration, and assonance remain constant. (For reference, the second rhyme Rubin refers to is \"One potato, two potato\".) So, he concludes,\n\n >  By either estimate [of the number of generations of children], *Eenie Meenie* has been stable for almost 20 generations. Thus the multiple constrains shown to operate in recall appear to function over historical time.\n\nRubin doesn't discuss the origins of the rhyme, but I don't imagine he'd have much to add to the report in Wikipedia. In terms of the motivation for why such a rhyme exists: counting-out rhymes are, if not universal, at least a very widespread habit among children. \"Eenie meenie\" fits into a category of many such rhymes: just in English, some other examples are \"One potato, two potato\"; \"Onery, twoery, tickery, teven\"; \"Acker, backer, soda cracker\"; and as other posters have pointed out, there's no shortage of counting-out rhymes in other languages."

                "Considered by whom?\n\nThe Byzantines considered their empire to be *the* Roman Empire, since there was unbroken rule from the Roman Empire to theirs. The relocation of the capital to Constantinople started a process that shifted the 'gravitational' centre of the Empire to the East long before the fall of the Western Empire in the 5th century, but for all its Greek-ness, the Eastern Empire considered itself 'the Empire', and 'Roman'. There wasn't an internal sense that they weren't the direct descendant of Rome at all.\n\nIn the West, another story is at play. You have the formal end of the Western Empire in 476 when Romulus Augustus is forced to abidicate, but the Western Empire ceased to function as considerably earlier. The title of Emperor was revived briefly under Charlemagne, but barely outlived his death. You then have Otto I crowned Emperor of the Romans in 962. *Europeans* saw this as a revival of the Roman state, based on the transfer of power, legitimisation by the Pope, and a cultural overlay of Romanity with Western Catholicism centered on Rome. Of course, the Byzantines had been holding the office of Emperor of the Romans all this time, so we none too pleased.\n\n",
                "Just as a FYI, whenever I see the word \"really\" in a question, it tends to red flag to me that it's going to get complicated and contentious, as the word is basically a challenge for iconoclasts and iconophiles to gather and deathmatch for the amusement (and sometimes education) of the OP.\n\nIn a nutshell, the answer to a question of \"was it really?\" will always be \"depends\".  This case is no different.\n\nMuch hinges upon definitions, of which nobody is in firm agreement on.  What constitutes a Roman?  What constitutes an empire?  What constitutes continuance?  What constitutes a split?  \n\nYour choice of how to answer these questions of definition, will ultimately reframe the question to a particular answer, as well as lead to even more questions.  \n\nNot to mention, that history is always being used to legitimize the present, thus the answer to your question, is also political.  Some people/ideologies/cultures/states have vested interests in claiming  continuity or discontinuity of the empire.\n\nThis being no different on Reddit, of which some have a particularly defensive attitude towards the Byzantines, that some of us AHers here have theorized comes from a certain affinity for particular factions in computer wargames (thank you Total War and Paradox Interactive).\n\nPut another way, the academics don't even agree on the answer to this question.  I seriously doubt we'll be able to resolve it on Reddit either.\n\nBut lets just say, in the interests of giving you an answer (albeit an unsatisfactory one), that:\n\nA case can be made for either of those positions.  But there is no consensus.  Nor will there probably ever be one, because of the useful political hot potato the Roman Empire is and likely will be in the forseeable future to people interested in making the Roman Empire a precedent for their views."

Even as the nuclei are ejected, you'd have this positive nucleus and a negative cloud of electrons, and that's pretty attractive. Plus most fission processes happen within a solid material, so there's really not a whole lot of room for the nuclei to move before they're stopped, so the electrons catch up pretty quickly. I don't know the exact timeframes here, but I wouldn't call it at any point a \"plasma\" (excepting the case of a fission bomb, where the reaction gets hot enough to strip electrons from their nuclei)",

The kinetic energy of these fission fragments is around 180 MeV, about an MeV/nucleon in rough numbers, accounting for most of the energy released in the fission process. While the fragments are moving quite fast (of order 10^9 cm/s), they aren't *so* fast that some of the electrons can't latch on before separation. Consequently, the fission fragments ejected aren't bare nuclei, typically, but rather nuclei with ionization states in the 20s or so (depending on conditions).\n\nThis assumes the parent nuclei begin with most of their electrons (e.g., the fissile material is a solid or weakly ionized plasma). If the nuclei are in a highly ionized plasma, however, such as in the later stages of a supercritical assembly, then the parent nuclei may have only a few bound electrons, the fission fragments will acquire fewer (or no) electrons as they go, and your original picture is more appropriate. \n\nAs for your last question, not only the ionization state of the fragments as they slow down in the surrounding matter, but also how far they go and how long it takes them to stop depend on the properties of the matter through which they travel.\n\nEdit: fixed a grammar mistake in the last sentence.

                "I don't know the source, but this topic came up at informal gathering of psychology researchers that I recently attended. Apparently, most thoughts are actually non-verbal. In a study, researchers would ask people at random intervals to say what they were thinking at that exact moment. It usually wasn't verbal. It was things like what to make for dinner, the temperature, how they were going to perform some task, etc. In fact, they frequently had a hard time verbalizing what they were thinking.\n\n*second hand info, so take with a grain of salt*",

He developed the Descriptive Experience Sampling method, which tackles what people experience at the \"footlight of consciousness\". I think there are 5 main categories of how people 'experience'. I don't remember everything, but the link should take you to all of the resources.",
                "I've asked myself that question for a while.\n\nIn the end, it seems like I couldn't not think without using some form of language or words. (In this case english) Most of the things that I think about require me to say it or go through it in my head with an inner monologue. For example, I am saying everything I type in my head, and thinking what I am going to say next.\n\n\nOther times when I'm figuring out how to solve a problem, either a mathematical problem or a puzzle, I would talk myself through the process of how to do it.\n\n\nBut, there are instances where I do not use an inner monologue. When I am playing FPS's, the number one rule I follow is to not \"think\". I don't talk to myself when running around shooting people. I rely on instinct, thinking without thinking about thinking. The reason is, when I start to talk to myself, I become misled and play much poorer than if I were to just play.\n\n\nSo in my case, for many tasks, I use an inner monologue to \"guide\" me through problems, but during situations where I don't have time to either form an inner monologue or think, I simply think- on the fly.\n\nI hope this answers your question!\n\nEdit: I used an inner monologue to form this answer",

That experience is not all that 'advanced' or 'deep' or whatever, but it is definitely the one that threw the most light on my self-understanding. I am not that voice in my head, and I can feel that now.\n\nIt's a bit vague but perhaps he is suggesting it's possible to train the brain to think in other ways than inner monologue, which may be preferable for some people. Can't comment on it myself as I haven't experienced this phenomenon.",

                "I can do both. I'm getting to where I can almost count without thinking numbers.  I work in a bank and the most time-consuming part of counting bills is the time it takes to \"say\" each number in my head.  I know my brain can keep track without putting the words to it, because the concept of 5 is separate from the word \"five,\" but where I get hung up is trusting myself to know that I've done it right. \n\nI'm working on it though.\n\nOn a side note, why did we make the names for numbers so long? Why should the word for 17 have three syllables when it's not a very high number?",
                "I usually don't have an inner monologue. One exception is sometimes when I'm studying. You know how they say the best way to learn something is to teach it to someone else? I pretend to teach the material to some imaginary person in my head using an inner monologue.\n\nI actually prefer teaching an imaginary person in my head over a real person because often my first attempt to explain something is hopelessly verbose and convoluted. In my head I can keep answering the same question over and over until I have a concise, intuitive answer. That's when I know I really understand something. I find this method of studying extremely effective, and it has served me well over the years.\n\nTo answer your original question, I think it's more efficient to think without an inner monologue, but using an inner monologue while studying really forces me to focus on details I might gloss over if I'm just thinking normally.",
                "I can't talk about the why or what, but I can talk a bit about advantage.\n\nEducation research shows that metacognition (thinking about f yyour thinking) improves learning. I'm going to make a big assumption and assume that thinking in an inner monologue means you are more likely to be metacognating than if you aren't thinking in speech. If this assumption is correct, having an inner monologue may improve learning.",
                "You just reminded me that I can actually remember a point in my childhood when I noticed that I had started to think in words, and tried to decide which way of thinking was best.  I found it a little restrictive and strange.\n\nAdditionally I suspect that in the minds of 'thinking in words' people, language will ultimately affect the thought process.  Orwell touches on this in '1984' with reference to newer editions of the official Newspeak Dictionary having less words than the previous one, and removal of negative words, being replaced by simply prefixing positive ones - 'ungood' rather than 'bad' for example.  I also suspect this is what makes German speaking people predisposed to excel in areas where ambiguity is not beneficial (engineering for example) as the language seems to lean towards there being few ways to express some concepts.",
                "There's a lot of evidence that complex thought is impossible without language.  For example, until a child learns the word \"before\" they probably don't have any way at all to conceptualize of one event preceding another.\n\nIt seems that all thought, then either engages either the language centers of the brain, or alternately reflexively uses familiar connections in the brain that were originally indexed by the language center of the brain.  By that I mean- you don't think the word \"chair\" every time you see a chair- but you always recognize it- and the concept of a \"chair\" is almost certainly primarily indexed by the language centers.\n\nSo, really, the difference between an internal monologue and more automatic thought would be the degree to which you are activating the language centers of your brain, or merely activating those clusters of neurons that are immediately peripheral to words that are making up the core of the thought.\n\nTo a certain extent you can actually do an exercise in which you can see how the same thought can be accessed in two different ways while remaining substantively identical:\n\nRead this phrase to yourself:\n\n\"I really eating potato chips.  They're very tasty.\"\n\nNow, read the sentence again, but this time as you read it, imagine that it is the voice of your father or mother or a celebrity speaking it.\n\nSo what was the difference?\n\nThe first time you read the sentence, the language centers of your brain lit up. On a brain scan that would be an area somewhere in the left hemisphere of your brain, fairly medial- maybe an inch or two in, back and behind and above your left ear.\n\nThe second time you read it- imagining someone else's voice- those same areas lit up, but additionally, parts of your auditory centers lit up as well- almost exactly as they would if you actually HEARD someone speaking.

                "**(1/2)**\n\nThe idea that to obtain true freedom African-Americans needed their own land was expressed several times throughout the war. But this radical effort to give them lands aroused the opposition of conservatives and brought to light the great ambiguities within the Republican ideology. \n\nReconstruction, for all intents and purposes, begins in 1863, when the Union finally came to control large sections of Louisiana and Tennessee. The Lincoln administration then entered an oftentimes bitter rivalry with Congress over who should control the Reconstruction process. As a moderate, Lincoln wanted to bring the rebellious states back into the Union as soon as possible, but Radical Republicans believed that Reconstruction would be worthless unless massive social and economic changes accompanied it. They sought to break the power of the White elites and help Black Americans to be truly independent. Wendell Phillips, for instance, said that \"The war can be ended only by annihilating that Oligarchy which formed and rules the South and makes the war—by annihilating a state of society.\" But the idea of making special efforts on behalf of the freedmen clashed hard with the prevailing idea of Free Labor. \n\nAs an ideology, Free Labor was the guiding principle of the Republican Party and their vision of what the North, and ultimately the United States, should be. But the ideology held that people should be given the *chance* to prove themselves, with everyone being given equal opportunity in what Lincoln called \"the race of life.\" Thus, it's evident that the ideology ignored the existence of systematic inequalities that would require a greater social and economic intervention on the part of the Federal Government. Some recognized that it was \"nonsense to talk about the inferiority of the negro race, whilst at the same time they are kept in a state of degradation\", but as a whole many Republicans believed that the lack of success of African-Americans was a result of their own moral defects, accusing them of being \"indolent, improvident, servile, and licentious.\" As a result, the idea of giving them free land struck many Republicans not as a step for equality, but as unjust aid that they, perhaps, would not be able to use. \n\nThe Black community itself declared that they needed just legal and political equality to achieve economic and social equality by themselves. None other than Frederick Douglass said that when it came to the Negro and his future position the government should “do nothing…. Give him a chance to stand on his own legs! Let him alone!” He further argued that special privileges would only breed bitterness and resentment, and do nothing to prepare African-Americans for freedom after the government inevitably stopped its involvement, saying that broad intervention would only “serve to keep up the very prejudices, which it is so desirable to banish.\" Insisting that \"dependence is degradation,\" Black leaders sought only equal opportunity: \"Remove all obstacles, and give the black man an equal chance, . . . and then should he not succeed, he will not ask you or anyone else to mourn over his failure.\" \n\nNonetheless, as long as political and social power remained in the hands of the same social elites, and systematic inequalities that hindered the economic advancement of Black communities remained, Blacks did not really have an equal chance. The new Southern governments that were created with the blessing and permission of the Johnson Administration showed this through their creation of \"Black codes\", laws that restricted the newfound freedom and rights of African-Americans. For example, they declared all Blacks not in employment to be \"vagrants\", and then assigned \"hard work\" as the punishment for convicted \"criminals.\" Years before this, prescient Radicals, such as the Hoosier Congressman George Julian, led the fight for the creation of a Freedmen's Bureau that could protect them and their rights, because otherwise the ex-slaves would fall into a system “a system of wage slavery … more galling than slavery itself.” \n\nThe Radicals supported a Confiscation Act that could take rebel land and distribute it among former slaves. But although the House and Senate both passed individual bills to that effect, no unified measure was reached. Legislation for the creation of the Freedmen's Bureau was also delayed due to confusion and fights over whether the Bureau should be under the War or Treasury Departments. Since the Treasury was headed by the Radicals' friend Salmon P. Chase, they wanted him to oversight the whole venture. After Chase was appointed to the Supreme Court and thanks also to Sherman's Special Field Orders N°15, the Bureau was finally created in 1865. In accordance with the Republican aversion of permanent guardianship of the Freedmen, the Bureau was supposed to exist for only one year, and it was given no budget. Some Radicals, like Charles Sumner, wanted it to be a permanent agency, equal to and independent of the other Departments, but this was to no avail. \n\nThe fact that Sherman took a part in this Radical measure is kind of ironic, for he was a rather conservative man who is described as \"neither a humanitarian reformer nor a man with any particular concern for blacks.\" Sherman himself would later said that he only issued the order as a temporal war-time measure at the behest of Secretary of War Stanton. As Sherman's army marched through Georgia, some 20,000 slaves abandoned their plantations and joined this \"fulfillment of the millennial prophecies.” When he reached Lincoln's Christmas Gift of Savannah, he was joined by Stanton, and they met with the Black leaders of the city. They made it clear that “to have land, and turn it and till it by our own labor,” would be the best form of preserving their liberty, and also that they \"would prefer to live by ourselves, for there is a prejudice against us in the South that will take years to get over.” Four days later, Sherman issued his orders, which \"designated the sea islands and the rich plantation areas bordering rivers for thirty miles inland from Charleston down to Jacksonville for settlement by freedmen.\" By June, some 40,000 freedmen had been settled. \n\nIt was shortly after this that Congress finally agreed on the final version of the bill creating the Bureau, approved it and send it to Lincoln, who signed it immediately. To avoid appearing to give an unfair favoritism towards Blacks, it also took charge of White Southern refugees. More importantly for the purposes of your question, the Bureau also had the authority to divide up confiscated lands - thus its name of \"Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands.\" The Bureau now had the daunting task of dividing the four hundred thousand acres of land the government had confiscated, disposing that individuals could claim no more than 40 acres, which they could buy at the end of three years rental with \"such title thereto as the United States can convey.\"  \n\nBut, what title could it convey? Property was a right protected by the Constitution, which also prohibited bills of attainder, that is, statutes or laws that targeted a person or persons for punishment. To take away the property of the Southerners, even if they were rebels, could be interpreted as a bill of attainder. When the Second Confiscation Act was first approved, Lincoln had objected because it allowed the confiscation of both private and real property forever, without the use of courts, in the areas in rebellion. The act did limit confiscation in the Border States, disposing that only real property (i.e. slaves) could be confiscated through the legal system. Lincoln still objected, and though some Senators huffed that having the President dictate legislation was an affront to Legislative autonomy, the act was amended to allow the President to restore confiscated property through pardons and making it so that confiscation would not extend beyond a person's natural life. \n\nLincoln himself supported the Bureau as a way to protect the freedmen and prepare them for liberty, but he was not prepared to take the Radical step or redistributing lands. Nonetheless, despite Conservative pressure for overturning the Orders, he did not do so, and would continue to support the experiments in Free Labor conducted on other parts of the Union, noting that “an earlier and happier consummation than the most sanguine friends of the freedmen could reasonably expect\" had taken place. He later signed the bill that created the Bureau, and allowed the settlement of \"Shermanland\" to continue under the oversight of the abolitionist Rufus Saxton, who told the Black community that they \"were to be put in possession of lands, upon which they might locate their families and work out for themselves a living and respectability.”\n\nWe cannot know what Lincoln would have done had he been able to lead Reconstruction. He denounced the fighting over the future of the South as \"pernicious abstractions\" and focused on getting them back on the Union as fast as possible, in order to achieve peace and create governments of loyal citizens. He supported the aforementioned \"experiments\" and he wanted Louisiana to enfranchise Black veterans and literate Gens de couleur, but still allowed the restored Louisiana government to operate despite the fact that it didn't do so. In any case, Lincoln was assassinated, and Johnson was the one who took charge. The Lincoln administration had never enforced the provisions for confiscation of lands of the Second Confiscation Act, but the Bureau still had 850,000 acres of abandoned land, not enough for all freedmen, but still something that could be used to build a class of African-American free laborers."

Nuclear submarines, nuclear aircraft carriers, and nuclear power plants all generate electricity in the same way\n\nSome countries generate a significant amount of their power from nuclear energy.  France generates 40% of its electricity from its 58 nuclear reactors.\n\nExpanding capacity is hard.  New nuclear reactors are very expensive due to all the regulations and safety features that are required.  The local population doesn't understand them and is generally afraid of the radiation(which doesn't get out) and pushes back against the construction of new reactors and power plants. \n\nWe're more focused on expanding solar and wind capacity these days as they have far far less political push back and are significantly quicker and more cost effective in the short term than nuclear power",
                "It does, nuclear power plants are a thing. But what you're imagining, probably, is a personal nuclear reactor to power all of the stuff in *one* house.\n\nA nuclear reactor is really complicated and really expensive and if maintained improperly can cause a nuclear disaster; after use it generates highly radioactive waste material that needs to be disposed of (and even the government has no real solution for this!). Even if they would let you build one and fuel it with radioactive material, you would probably produce more energy than your individual house would ever use.\n\nYou might take a look at small reactors [this Wikipedia article](_URL_0_); if you click \"Gross power\" you can sort by the amount of power able to be produced: it doesn't get very small!\n\nA smaller scale nuclear-powered device is a [radioisotope thermoelectric generator](_URL_1_). Radioisotopes experience mass decay, and according to E=mc^2 they also produce energy. This has been used in spaceships going on very, very long missions. But you still have to get radioactive isotopes, so nobody would ever let you use it!",
                "Uranium fuelled reactors like the CANDU use ordinary uranium, \n\nhowever in the US, most reactors use enriched uranium for fuel, and the byproduct of that reactor can then be further processed to make nuclear weapons.\n\nStill other uranium fuelled reactors have an end product that can be isotopes used in medical testing and scientific instruments and for other scientific research purposes.\n\nAnd then there is the Thorium reactor that doesn't even use uranium. Thorium is plentiful and cheap. It also can be used as a reactor fuel, with a very intrinsically safe design, but the development costs are huge before a modern design can be standardised, and there is no military benefit from the end products."

                "It depends on what you mean by \"generate\". But...\n\nGenetic sequences don’t create cells from nothing. A genome is housed in a cell, and it got there from another genome that was housed inside a parental cell, and so on, going all the way back billions of years to the origin of cellular life. If you want to “generate” the organism from scratch, it’s not a question of pure information: you have to provide the genetic sequence with a very particular environment, that in nature would have simply been inherited from a progenitor cell. So it’s a physical problem of making and then putting thousands of different components together in very complex ways, and to do that, you’d need incredibly advanced biomolecular technology. \n\nYou also need additional information about the physical and informational structure of the organism that is not contained in the genetic sequence. (Look into [epigenetics.](_URL_0_))\n\nDepending on the complexity of the cell you want to make, generation from scratch might involve synthesizing lots of different organelles, different kinds of membranes, a microtubule framework, a cytoplasm with just the right chemical makeup, and putting all these things together in exactly the right way so the genetic sequence can operate correctly in the cell you’ve made for it. That is something far beyond our abilities at present.\n\nAnd this is only considering single cells. With multicellular organisms you’d face a whole host of problems relating to embryogenesis and development. If you think about your genetic sequence, it didn’t allow you to come into being fully formed, in an arbitrary environment. You started from a single cell in which your genome was configured epigenetically in a very specific way. Your subsequent development completely depended on being attached to a placenta inside your mother. So no, just knowing your genetic sequence doesn’t allow you to be generated in a lab somewhere.\n\nWith very simple organisms like bacteria, you can sometimes get away with substituting one genome for a quite different one, and the new instructions will still function with the foreign cellular “machinery”. There’s been a lot of work in this area, perhaps the most high profile being Craig Venter’s “Life 2.0” project, although it really falls under the heading of ‘partially synthetic organism’ rather than ‘generating life from scratch’.\n",
                "This is a really good question.\n\nEven if you have the complete DNA sequence of a molecule, it won't do anything by itself. DNA is chemically inert and needs other proteins, such as polymerases and transcription factors in order to know what to do. Not to mention how its folded in regards to nucleosomes makes a big deal on how certain regions are expressed.\n\nThe problem is really that every cell has come from a fully formed cell before it that has divided to form two cells. In order to create a brand new replicating cell we need to create both the DNA itself, and the incredibly complex chemical environment of a preformed cell. At the moment recreating am entire cell from scratch materials isn't really feasible.\n\nHowever, for simpler biological systems, specifically viruses, this is totally possible. For many viruses if you just insert their naked genome into a permissive cell you'll get infectious particles. In that sense as long as we have the sequence of the genome of a virus it's never truly extinct.\n\nAs DNA synthesizing becomes cheaper and more in-house this could actually become a problem. Any lab with access to the sequence of the smallpox genome, a DNA synthesizer, and the right cell cultures, could easily produce infectious smallpox virions.",
                "The other comments here about needing an operating cellular environment are the best answer, but just for completeness I should also mention that most genome sequencing efforts you hear about are not literally whole genome sequences. Even the most complete genome sequences, such as *Homo sapiens* or *Drosophila* fruit flies are still missing large sections of repetitive elements and heterochromatic regions. We are continually getting closer and closer to full sequence, but we're not there yet. Some people think it will actually never be possible. I tend to disagree, though there is certainly no way with our existing methods.\n\nBacteria have generally simpler genomes and genomic organization and I *think* there are complete bacterial genomes, but someone will correct me if I'm wrong about that.",
                "DNA is the code that determines the proteins/genetic traits/etc. for an organism, but the code itself is really just a basic part of a very convoluted greater system within a cell. What genes get accessed, how those proteins interact, how the cells divide, how the cells differentiate and everything else are part of complex signaling cascades. Your neurons are way different than your skin cells, even with the same DNA, due to these developmental signaling pathways. \n\nObviously when humans make a baby, we don't just form from DNA strands. We form from cells (sperm and egg) with their own DNA that fuse and activate all these pathways that are part of the (very complex) developmental process we've evolved. But take away the normal environment of fertilization, and things get a bit trickier. We've successfully cloned animals, but it took a lot of attempts and modifications aside from just replacing a cell's DNA with DNA of choice. Each species of cloned animal had different scientific hurdles that had to be overcome in order to be produced, and still other issues with the cloned animal once it was alive (which are progressively more difficult the more complex the species is). \n\nIn less complex organisms, cloning is easier. You could probably easily plop in your DNA of choice and it would go on to make an organism. But I don't know all the technical limitations involved.\n\nSo, really, you always need DNA as part of a cellular structure because the DNA doesn't really form the structures outright, it exists first in concert with them, including many proteins and their signaling pathways. DNA is not just this magic ingredient that forms an organism. It is accessed in specific ways to sort of run the \"development program\" of an organism in a very complex pattern of activation and repression of specific genes.\n",
                "This has (sort of) [already been done](_URL_0_). However, it required a functioning cell into which the synthetic DNA was implanted. So, yes - it is possible to generate an organism using synthesized DNA, but currently a host cell of the same species is required. ",
                "An organism is more than the sequence of its genome. *Much more.* \n\nIn a world where we know how to create life, let's imagine the instruction manual to do it is a great thick book called *This is Life*. Now let's imagine that some rogue ethicist breaks into the vault beneath the Declaration of Independence where the book is kept and burns it. The contents of the book are 95% destroyed, but the index and the table of contents are more or less spared. \n\nThat's about as far as knowing the sequence of an organism's genome, and the current state of molecular biology, gets you. I guess you could say we know what's in the book, and we've got bits and pieces of it, but that's it. \n\nWe don't know how to create a self-perpetuating genome (the synthetic [*Mycoplasma*](_URL_0_) cell from a few years ago was a synthetic genome that was laboriously pieced together and then inserted into an already living cell that was essentially hijacked by the synthetic genome). We don't know how to create a cell. We don't fully understand how a cell develops into an organism. Those would be, in my mind, chapters one, two, and three in *This is Life*. There would be many, many more chapters. \n\nMolecular biology is an extremely immature science. You could argue it only really got going in 1953, when the structure of DNA was determined. You could further argue it didn't *really* get going until the 1970s when restriction enzymes were first characterized. Simply put, we don't know nearly enough. Not remotely. ",
                "\"Generating it\" could mean many things. Let's break the question into a few smaller bits:\n\n**(1) Can we be sure we know the genetic sequence?** We can be pretty confident, but there is a snag when it comes to repeated regions. Sequencing costs have come down enormously over the past decade, but current techniques rely on sequencing many randomly generated short segments and then using a computer to identify where they overlap to build the genome sequence. Eukaryotic genomes often have long regions of repeated DNA, so if the short segments of DNA you sequence are shorter than the length of the repeated region, you will never know how many repeats the original genome had. On top of this, the genome isn't quite fixed between cells of one organism, with small alterations building up between the stem cells in different regions as you age. These problems are less of a concern in bacteria, but they might pose a larger challenge for making synthetic multicellular life.\n\n**(2) Can we generate the genetic sequence synthetically?** Yes. We can only directly synthesize a few hundred bases before errors start to become very common. But thanks to tricks like [Gibson assembly](_URL_2_), we can make those short synthetic DNA bits assemble into longer sequences. Again, there is a challenge when it comes to long stretches of repetitive DNA, because the reassembled DNA might skip a repeated section and these regions can shorten easily during PCR amplification, but these are technical challenges that money/time can overcome.\n\n**(3) Can we put the synthetic genome inside a pre-existing cell and make it work?** This is at the edge of our abilities now. More than 10 years ago viable polio virus was created from [synthetic DNA](_URL_0_). Other commenters mentioned the success of [Gibson et al.](_URL_1_) in generating viable bacteria using synthetic DNA. But doing this with other species will be trickier. DNA in multicellular organisms needs to have much more epigenetic regulation than in single-celled organisms. That is because your neurons, skin cells, muscle cells, etc. all have (very nearly) the exact same DNA in them. The epigenetic differences are what differentiates those cells from each other. Large portions of the genome have to be silenced in a viable cell, and different regions are silenced in different cells. This silencing is accomplished through many different mechanisms working at the same time, and there is much we don't understand. Even taking existing differentiated cells and and turning them back into stem cells (called [induced pluripotent stem cells](_URL_3_)) is very difficult. Getting a full \"sequence\" of all the epigenetic features of a cell line is beyond our current abilities right now. If we just tried to exchange a synthetic genome of naked DNA into, say, mouse cells, the cells would be reading all the wrong bits of DNA at once.\n\n**(4) Can we synthesize the rest of the cell?** As in, how far away are we from generating life from direct synthesis of not just DNA, but the proteins, membranes, etc.? This is far, far beyond what we can do. Cells are extremely efficient factories for generating complex molecules and assembling them into larger functioning units. And we don't even know everything that is in a cell. This would be like asking a child with a lego set to build a Tesla.\n\n**tl/dr** Some simple life forms can be generated from synthetic DNA right now, but for multicellular organisms this will be much harder.",
                "It might not be a decent analogy, but it would be like writing a book based on the index. You have all the information on what's in there, and you can compared to other books from it, but without the rules of writing, or the context for those words, you can't build the book. \n\nAs others say, a genetic sequence is not the full information for an organism, you need much more interesting things on top. The genome is just a remarkably simple looking basis. ",
                "For say a human, there's the issue of gestation. You'd need to have the mother completely simulated. In order to have the organism truly generated you'd have to generated the mother (otherwise its not true to \"generating it\" with no parent) and you'd still need to make the egg and sperm combine in such a way as to create that set of DNA.",
                "DNA is, in the sense you're looking at it, not much more than a blueprint that came along well after the development of cells and allowed a subset of them to have a stable enough genome that they could form complex and stable multicellular organisms. It's a latecomer.\n\nThe real functional star of the show, as far as genetic material goes, is RNA, which is less stable but much more versatile than DNA. DNA's function is to act as a stable, readable record; almost every other function carried out via genetic material is done via RNA, and there is a significant amount of information encoded in the relative quantities of RNA sequences, not just their codes.\n\nIn order to replicate the genome, assuming you have also advanced modern science far enough already to create a cell from scratch, you need the DNA sequence and a pool of RNA as finely-tuned as 4 billion years already made it.",
                "Others have given excellent replies particularly about the problems of building from DNA, but I didn't see any mention of epigenetics. \n\nThe complete genetic sequence of an organism contains active and inactive genes. Only active genes are expressed and used during synthesis. The so-called epigenetics of what is enabled and what is not comes partly from the environment and partly from inheritance and it may also change through development. If all the genes were expressed at the same time, the result may not even be viable as a mammalian pluripotent (non-specialized) embryonic cell has enough information to become any part of the body: heart, brain, eye or whatever. Clearly it cannot be all at once and be viable.",
                "It's like having a cookbook which tells you specifically how to create a particular million-course ultra-gourmet meal, but not having a kitchen.\n\nAnd yes, this could be possible - but we need to figure out how to build a sufficiently extensive kitchen first. Right now we have the equivalent of half a chopstick and a home-made candle."

                "I think this is going to be quite a subjective ranking, but Wild West towns during mineral rushes are certainly strong contenders. I know mainly about the mineral rushes in Colorado and then the Yukon Gold Rush, but I'm sure that a look into the history of the 49ers in California would reveal similar places that briefly were truly lawless. These were places that sprang up nearly overnight -- the hasty construction of the town of Creede, Colorado, was so poor that the entire town burned one night in 1892 -- that had no customs, family structures, religious or other charitable institutions, etc. already established in them. They attracted desperate people hoping to make a fortune, often in a get-rich-quick way, and then the inevitable businesses that followed: brothels, saloons, and gambling parlors all appeared to part the miners with what little money they might have made. With new people pouring in every day -- the trains coming into Denver's Union Station in the 1880s were packed, day and night -- there were always new arrivals ready to be fleeced. Official institutions like sheriffs couldn't keep up with the influx of new people to hitherto deserted or sparsely-inhabited places, and politicians were often easily corrupted with the promise of getting rich quick. \n\nThe infamous Soapy Smith -- whose wikipedia tagline really sums him up, so apologies for the wiki quote: \n\n >  Jefferson Randolph \"Soapy\" Smith II (November 2, 1860 – July 8, 1898) was a famous con artist, saloon and gambling house proprietor, gangster and crime boss\n\n-- personifies the kinds of activities that were common in these frontier towns. He worked out of Denver, Colorado, Creede, Colorado, and lastly Skagway, Alaska, during mineral rushes in those towns. He notoriously controlled Denver politics from the late 1870s until he moved to Creede in 1892. He gained his nickname \"Soapy\" for a scam he ran involving the selling of soap on the streets of Denver. Later, he operated out of the Tivoli Club at the corner of 17th and Market (not to be confused with the current location of the Tivoli Brewing Company on the Auraria campus). You can see some cool old photos of it [here](_URL_1_). The Tivoli Club was a gambling den where the house always won, and because Soapy and his associates controlled Denver city elections, it was allowed to operate, despite strong protest from the press, who dubbed it the \"slaughter pen\" because of how much unchecked violence took place there. In fact, one thing that had originally drawn Soapy to Denver in 1879 was its lax restrictions on gambling. \n\nEventually, however, Soapy's operation became too well known, and the politicians he had previously controlled were forced by public/media outcry to pass stronger gambling laws. So, in 1892, Soapy headed south to the town of Creede, Colorado, which was in the midst of a silver boom. The town went from a population of 600 in 1889 to more than 10,000 people in December 1891, and was famous as a place where it was never night -- it's in a narrow canyon, and the lights from the saloons, brothels, and other gambling establishments going all night reflected off the canyon walls. Soapy quickly established himself as the crime boss in the town and used that power to try to run out other outlaws. The sheriff, William Sidney \"Cap\" Light, was Soapy's brother-in-law. \n\nAs I said above, Creede burned down -- going from [this](_URL_2_) to [this](_URL_0_) (sorry, can't embed that last image). There's a great image in the Denver Museum of Nature and Science Rocks and Minerals section if you ever get a chance to go there that shows that main street in Creede jam-packed with people. After the town was destroyed, it was quickly rebuilt, but a silver panic in 1893 combined with Denver loosening its gambling laws yet again put an end to this lawless, frontier-period there as train-loads of eager miners stopped arriving and the criminal element, including Soapy, migrated back to Denver. \n\nSo there are two examples of essentially \"lawless\" places for certain times and places in history. I can tell you more anecdotes about similar towns, like Skagway, Alaska, where Soapy died in a gunfight four days after appearing in a parade with the mayor, or Leadville, Colorado, briefly the most populated place in Colorado during the silver boom and where Doc Holliday was exonerated by a jury after shooting the local deputy dead over $5. But beyond just anecdotes, I think what unifies these stories is the conditions, like I described above, that allowed lawlessness to flourish -- and note that they are not stable situations and that once the mineral rushes had ended, they became lawful towns once again. \n\nIf you'd like to read an amazing piece of historical fiction set partially in Colorado during this time and a little later, I highly recommend Thomas Pynchon's *Against the Day*. \n\nAll that being said, I'm sure other lawless locations include places in the aftermath of wars, or even during them (like in Syria right now) -- any time that normal society is interrupted, often by an influx of large numbers of desperate people and people who are ready and able to take advantage of them (two groups which presumably have a lot of overlap)."

This view was later criticized or apologized for by later indian astronomers, who clearly lacked the insights Aryabhatta had.\n\nAnd the ancient's idea of expressing all orbits of planets around the sun suggest a precursor of a Heliocentric theory. This however did not develop fully, as Aryabhatta continued the use of variable epicycles, which even though being a better system than Ptolemy's, shows that it was still an earth centric model for all calculation purposes.",

For example when Eratosthenes [calculated the circumference of the Earth](_URL_0_)...\n\n > Eratosthenes calculated the circumference of the Earth without leaving Egypt. Eratosthenes knew that, on the summer solstice, at local noon in the Ancient Egyptian city of Swenet (known in Greek as Syene, and in the modern day as Aswan) on the Tropic of Cancer, the sun would appear at the zenith, directly overhead (he had been told that the shadow of someone looking down a deep well would block the reflection of the Sun at noon). \n\n > Using a gnomon, he measured the sun's angle of elevation at noon on the solstice in his hometown of Alexandria, and found it to be 1/50th of a circle (7°12') south of the zenith. He could have used a compass to measure the angle of the shadow cast. Assuming that the Earth was spherical (360°), and that Alexandria was due north of Syene, he concluded that the meridian arc distance from Alexandria to Syene must therefore be 1/50 = 7°12'/360°, and was therefore 1/50 of the total circumference of the Earth.\n\nSo basically with a sundial and the memory of when the sun was directly overhead somewhere else, he more-or-less figured out the size of the planet. He was a little off because his assumption of a spherical Earth was incorrect (among other things) but his reasoning was almost spot-on:\n\n > If Eratosthenes calculation is performed with the correct data, the result is 40,074 km. This is 66 km of difference (0.16%) from the current aproximation of the Earth's circumference."

                "Because it was a ruse.\n\nSeveral leaders and juntas, but not all, in the many wars of independence in Latin America in the early 19th century used a supposed loyalty to Fernando VII to grow their base of support that in many cases were not clamouring for independence or had any ill-will towards the king. Through this, juntas and leaders could proclaim home rule in the name of Fernando VII in opposition to the illegitimate monarch installed by Napoleon after 1808.\n\nMiguel Hidalgo certainly took advantage of this \"mask of Fernando\" (as its known historiographically) to shield himself and the nascent independence movement in New Spain from any accusations of disloyalty towards the king. Although Hidalgo did not take pleasure in putting on the mask of Fernando VII, he mixed loyalty to the monarchy with attacks against Europeans (*Gachupines*) in New Spain in his famous speech in Dolores. This worked wonders for Hidalgo and revolutionary movements around Latin American who appealed to loyalty to the king. It might seem strange to us as to why revolutionaries would spout a different ideology than the one they truly wanted to achieve, but a closer look at the contemporary context of warring movements and even governments meant that in those fateful first years of the independence conflicts, you had to thread a fine line so as to not lose supporters to other groups, sometimes as close as a different junta in a different city. Furthermore, we can't assume that all revolutionary leaders and juntas were looking following *republican* principles. José de San Martín, for example, was far more interested in a constitutional monarchy than a republic.\n\nPredictably to us now, the ruse sooner or later stopped working and many threw off the mask when the time was right. This included Hidalgo who stopped evoking Fernando VII's name to gather support for his movement."

This means that a wing suit would have a glide ratio better than that of the Space Shuttle, and on par with a commercial airliner, but not as high as a sailplane.~~\nthe glide ratio will remain the same, but the amount of power required to sustain flight will be reduced by a factor of about 15.\n\n*It should be noted that there are powered wing suits that can fly on Earth, so those would obviously fly under their own power in this scenario, though it's not by flapping.\n\nAlso, since you're building a hypothetical giant pressurized building, you could increase the density of air to further manipulate things.  With higher density, it gets easier to fly, and at extreme densities, \"swimming\" through the atmosphere becomes possible, although at those densities, the pressure would cause other problems.\n\n**Edit:**  Many have pointed out that I didn't answer the question in terms of \"flapping power.\"  To my knowledge, there is no existing suit capable of this, so it would be speculation to try to answer that exact question. (There was a [guy](_URL_0_) who claimed to do exactly this, but I believe he later admitted it was a hoax.)\n\nIf the question was reworded to just mean in terms of general human-powered flight, /u/asdf90j2309jasdf answers the question with calculations for hovering [down here](_URL_1_).",
                "I think you'll find a lot of answers you're looking for in [this](_URL_0_) xkcd. It has more to do with air density, so there are a couple planets/moons in the solar system where you could do this without an enclosed structure. \n\nI think it's important to specify how pressurized you're talking; theoretically, an enclosed, pressurized structure on planet earth would be suitable for human powered flight as well.",

Since things weigh 6x less on the Moon, then one could maintain a hover if they weigh less than 156 lbs on the Earth, assuming 100% efficiency and not including the weight of the machine. So, I think it would be possible to build a helicopter bicycle that you could fly if you're fit enough, but you would have to pedal so hard that you would get exhausted quickly. It would be a trip that lasts but a few moments.",
                "Nobody has answered the question of what sort of thrust a human could make with a wingsuit.  I'd suspect it's only a few fractions of a pound.  I'm not even sure you'd develop enough forward airspeed to make the efficient wingsuits inflate on the moon.\n\nNow, could you fly on your own power?  Definitely.  You can do that in earth gravity.  For long periods.  (Eg; gossamer albatross)  Instead of needing 1/4hp you could do it on 1/24hp.  1/12hp is something that even \"untrained humans\" can develop.  So \"everyone\" could pedal a plan around your theoretical stadium.  \n\nCan a human develop 1/24hp with their arm and chest muscles?  That's another question.  And one I suspect is a \"yes.\"  So you could be Icarus if you felt like it."

                "Eating brains does run a higher risk than eating muscle or other organs, but that risk is still very low. If you read about the epidemiology of Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD), the most common prion disease, the incidence was 1 in 1,000,000 from 1979 to 1994 and 5 in 1,000,000,000 in those under the age of 30 in the US. With that said, CJD is is thought to have a 20-50 year incubation period which could explain why it's so rare in young people. I think more supportive (or contradictory) evidence of this will start appearing in the 2000-2040 time frame (20-50 years after) the UK 80s-90s outbreak and those that ate that tainted beef.\n\nTesting for BSE in cattle and discarding those that have the disease helps protect those that eat cattle organs (particularly the brain).  \n\nTLDR: It's all about statistical probability and the risk of a prion disease infection is very low.",
                "Tougher for the prions to transmit from cows to humans, however, cultures like the \"Fore\" in Papua New Guinea experienced much higher rates of prion-related diseases, [Kuru](_URL_0_), because they used to consume the body and brains of their deceased. Ironically, they only would participate in this ritual if the deceased looked healthy upon their death, and Kuru had a side effect of 'marbling' muscle making it more appetizing--only leading to the continuing spread of the disease. \n\nSource--wrote a research paper on Kuru and CJD for a physio class",
                "In addition to what others have written, a major problem with the 90s  outbreak was how modern western food systems operate. \n\nFor one, cows in many places were being given meat, bone and feather meal in their feed that may have been contaminated and may have spread the disease. On their natural diet of grass, cows may still spontaneously develop a prion disease, but it would be less likely. \n\nSecondly, meat products now often involve blending of meat from from different cows. That effectively multiplies the chances by however many individual cows contribute to a particular hamburger. When eating a brain, however, it is likely just a single cow involved."

                "There are a couple of things that happened, but mainly there's one thing, the rise of colonial rebellion.\n\nDuring WW2, France fell and resulted in one terrible thing, Free France was fighting for France and left the colonies to their own devices. These colonial holdings generally fought with the Allies (with North Africa siding with Vichy due to proximity and German invasion later on to support the Italians). With Free France fighting the Axis, the colonial holdings got used to being left alone. Combined with this, France was giving fuel to anti-French forces within these colonies due to neglect and long building anti-French sentiment building from the turn of the 20th century.\n\nWith France liberated, the focus was on the White French that fought over the years, pushing aside the many non-white soldiers that fought and bled over the years. Charles de Gaulle even told General Leclerc to find more white soldiers since many of his soldiers were from Central and North Africa. Naturally this would also alienate many of those soldiers that were suddenly finding themselves as inferior to the few white French that fought with them, something General Leclerc voiced.\n\nSo, with France secure, the French wanted to return back to normal but as usual that wouldn't happen. Many of the colonies had been pushing France away, including major players like French Indochina and Algeria in the early to mid fifties. In the attempt of trying to neutralize these threats, the wars would turn against France and cause the public opinion to change against them in favor of independence, leading to a Constitutional Crisis that stems from the Algerian crisis.\n\nWith a new Constitution led by Charles de Gaulle, France would politically settle in respect to their governmental position, but this doesn't mean that France is done. De Gaulle wanted to return France into a major world power. This would lead to many things, such as a strong military (which is still one of the premier forces in Europe and a major arms dealer in the world), a strong focus on atomic power to ensure no fuel dependency (as France has a high number of nuclear power plants), and a strong political position in the new Post-War/Post Independence Crisis Europe. All of these are major tenants of Gaullism that would become a major political ideology within France that was neither truly left or right. De Gaulle was more conservative but still asserted republican ideology within France and a unified ideal of France that is more patriotic than ideological.\n\nThis focus on a strong, unified, and powerful France would of course have problems with many other groups. France \"left\" NATO but only because of the American command structure that effectively had America as the leader of NATO. De Gaulle didn't like that and an American focus on equipment so France effectively pulled out of NATO, but never truly did as they made agreements with NATO to support NATO if there was any attack made by the Soviets.\n\nThe 20th Century wasn't the kindest to France. France hadn't industrialized as quickly as the rest of Europe and lost the population advantage they had during the early 19th century. Combined with the extreme loss of life during the First World War and the general ineffective interwar government made France ripe to be easily defeated during the Second World War. However France would recover thanks to de Gaulle.\n\nEdit: Forgot Sources\n\n*Free France's Lion: The Life of Philippe Leclerc, de Gaulle's Greatest General* by William Moore.\n\n*France and the French: A Modern History* by Rod Kedward"

                "The short answer would be that individual police officers aren't individually liable in most circumstances.  You can't sue them individually (well, you can, but it will be quickly thrown out).  Exceptions may apply in some limited situations.\n\nBasically, a police officer is an agent of the state, unlike a doctor or lawyer. As such, what they do is basically covered by the state.\n\nLots of people think that this is a bad idea, and that officers should be individually liable.  But the risks here are real.  A rich person may freely sue every officer that interacts with him, and \"out-lawyer\" them, eventually ensuring that no police officer will mess with them.  If you sue a department, the department has access to a much larger budget, oftentimes it's own legal staff, a large group insurance across many agencies, and at the end of the day the taxpayer. An individual officer has only access to his own paycheck, which are generally far more modest than those of lawyers and doctors. \n\nWhile protections for police officers and other often get a bad rap, and they often get a bad rap for good reasons, getting rid of the those protections also risks a return to the days when police weren't professionals, but rather jobs handed out to cronies and political supporters of elected officials, who may also become that elected officials private army.  That's bad.  Police officers require some degree of insulation from the fact that 99% of the people they talk to aren't happy to see them. \n\nDo some police officers abuse their limited liability?  Certainly.  But the solution is to remove those officers, not to destroy the system because of a few bad eggs."

But this is an example of a system where even the tiniest change can result in huge differences in the end results. Where and how the ball is dropped is different in a minuscule way which completely changes its path through the machine.

We simply represent one of many possible solutions to a particular problem.\n\nFor comparison, consider the marsupial mammals of australia and the placental mammals of africa. These environments are very similar and in each environment, there are categories of animals that have evolved to exploit particular niches. For example, there is a niche for living underground and eating worms. Thus the mole and the marsupial mole. Not closely related at all, but they have many common features such as very large front claws, because they are solving similar problems. For a more disparate example, consider the niche for large grazing animals. Africa spawned antelopes, etc; Australia spawned kangaroos.

                "Hello there ! \n\nThat perception of things comes from common misconceptions.\n\nFirst of all, the sense of the word tyrant have evolved since medieval times. It originates from Greek and originally meant someone that came to power out of legitimate ways, such as succession or election. With time it acquired the idea of absolute power and, finally, of oppression. Yet the Greeks, in general, did not see tyrants as necessarily \"evil\". It was, rather, one form of government, although probably not the best even by their standards. It is only with time that the word tyrant acquired its meaning of oppressing, dictatorial rule.\n\nThat is important, because medieval and Renaissance philosopher, surrounded and very fond of classical authors, may very well refer to the classical sense of tyranny. \n\nNow, if you apply that prism to their discourse, you will see that it generally does not aim at kings, for they came to power *via* legitimate ways (in this case, succession). Therefore, they are not \"textbook\" tyrants, for the lack one key component : illegitimacy.\n\nNow for the second misconception, I'll send you [here](_URL_0_), to an answer I've already written on the subject. The general idea, though, is that medieval kings would likely not really be considered tyrants, even by our modern standards. Their power was far less absolute than what we like to imagine and they had to deal with many counter-powers : nobility, administration, Church, deputies of the bourgeoisie, ... That would of course differ from one place to another, so keep in mind I'm speaking mostly about medieval France here.\n\nOne key element of the tyrant classical definition that we overlooked earlier is the idea that the tyrant, although he doesn't abolish laws, keeps himself above them. They do not really apply to him. That is NOT the case for French king (and English king were rather less absolute rulers). Laws, customs, rights and local specificity were to be respected, even by the king. \n\nI'll give you an example, too. In early XVth century France, the king Charles VI is stricken by madness. He has prolonged periods of delirium and depression, with short remission periods in between. Therefore, the kingdom is ruled by his \"private council\" : top nobles and administrators. In this council, two men oppose each other. Louis d'Orléans, the king's brother, and Jean de Bourgogne, the king's cousin. They are the two wealthiest and most powerful lords of France at the time. \n\nSince the king is not dead and his very person is sacred, he can not be removed from office, and no regent can be appointed. Therefore, he who controls the council controls the kingdom, and specifically the lucrative pensions that can be generously granted to himself. \n\nAt the beginning, the scales weighs in favor of Louis d'Orléans, who manages to assert his control on the council. Civil war is avoided in 1405, but the tension remains extreme.\n\nIn 1407, Louis d'Orléans is assassinated in a trap in the middle of Paris. The assassins are tracked back to the house of the Jean de Bourgogne, who rides out of the capital in haste.\n\nHe is summoned by the council and the king to be judged, and he finally comes. But with him is Jean Petit, a theologian from the Sorbonne. Jean Petit has redacted an \"Apology of tyrannicide\". In this speech, he explains that indeed Louis d'Orléans was a tyrant, considering himself above the laws, acting against the will of the king, favoring his own interest rather than the people's and generally trying to gather absolute power. Therefore, he concludes, he who had the tyrant slain is a hero. That, of course, scandalizes the nobility, because Jean de Bourgogne had his own cousin murdered and he confesses it **proudly**, yet it shows you the differences between our \"modern tyrants\" and what medieval philosophers would call a tyrant (since Jean Petit used their definition of tyranny).\n\n & #x200B;\n\nI hope that answered your question !\n\nI did provide some references in the linked post, but if you need I think I could provide some on this specific topic. Just let me know."

With a Chinese lead bank, Chinese state owned resource companies and development companies will get a better shot at contracts.\n\nEdit: Another thing is China's foreign reserve is full of US treasury bonds, which is not paying any interest at all right now. Putting some of it in the new bank will probably get them a higher interest rate than 0, even if they lose some of it.",
                "It means, in a basic sense, that nations will be able to go to an Eastern-led development bank instead of Western banks such as the World Bank and IMF (as you mentioned). Since countries usually agree to certain development terms when they receive loans from these places, the issuer of the loan gains control over the development process to a certain extent. Furthermore, since these banks are Western the development parameters will be much more Western-friendly, such as free trade with the US and EU, or growth in a market that would benefit the West. \n\nA Chinese/Eastern development bank would give an alternative to the Western approach. Whether it would be good or bad for developing countries is yet to be seen, but I believe competition usually breeds a positive outcome (lower interest rates, less strict requirements on loans). In either case, it would take away some power the West holds over certain developing countries. Also, it gives countries shunned by the West access to large development banks granted the Chinese/East are willing to put up with them (Iran, Venezuela).",
                "The Bretton Woods system of the IMF, World Bank,  and such,  grew out of World War 2.  With Europe and Asia trashed, the US was positioned to take the lead in economic growth,  and coerced the rest of world to adopt the dollar (and gold) as the trade currency. Having the dollar be the currency of the world Trade is very beneficial to the country in control of that currency.  \n\nTo use the system,  you have to abide by \"Western\" rules. Most of the West is developed, and makes their money by moving money around and giving it to developing countries. Developed countries don't have to rape and pillage the land to get ahead,  developing countries do. \n\nDeveloping countries don't like to be told that they can't do what they want and what they think they need to, in order to get to where developed countries are. The west was allowed to burn their forests,  pollute the water,  and force children to work.  Why can't developing countries? \n\n Bretton Woods system forces countries to abide by a 70 year old system, one beneficial  to the US,  and one some think is artificially limiting. \n\nThe repercussions of the growth of the AIIB , and the fall of the Bretton Woods? Who knows. Maybe having competition is good and allows both systems to serve different needs. Maybe having an alternative allows a country to have its needs met by the other and everyone wins. More likely,  the banking systems are tied up with the new cold war and the political aims of their parent country.  Instead of proxy wars through Asia between the Americans and the Soviets,  there are proxy banking wars between the US and China. ",

But it's not just a light tap, it has to strike with a decent amount of force.  In order to do that, the hammer (the part you cock back on a pistol, [highlighted here](_URL_2_) is spring-loaded.  When you cock it, the hammer is pulled against the spring and held in place until you pull the trigger, which releases the hammer, which hits the firing pin (or is attached to it), which hits the primer...etc.\n\nThere are two ways dropping a handgun can cause it to fire.  If the hammer is cocked and you drop it, you may jar the hammer so that it slips past the mechanism holding it back, in which case it slams into the firing pin just like it's supposed to do, as if you had pulled the trigger.  That is not good, and it's also why you should never keep your firearm cocked until you're ready to use it.  But as u/NO_LATTE_NO_PEACE pointed out, many pistols are double-action, so you don't have to cock the hammer first.  The hammer is cocked *as you pull the trigger* until you reach a point in the swing of the trigger that releases the hammer.  If it's an automatic or semi-automatic weapon, the firing action reloads the gun and cocks the hammer again.  Single-action weapons, like the revolvers of the old west, require you to cock the hammer each time you want to fire, before you pull the trigger.\n\nSo if you're carrying a weapon for personal defense, it's probably going to be a double-action, in which case you can carry it without it being cocked and you don't have to worry about wasting the time to cock it.  Single-action weapons are generally considered to be simpler and more reliable.  But that's neither here nor there.\n\nThe other way a weapon might fire when dropped is if it lands directly on the hammer.  In that case, when the hammer hits the ground and transfers the energy of the drop into the hammer, it pushes the hammer against the firing pin with a lot of force, exactly as if the hammer had been released by the trigger.  The floor hits the hammer, which hits the firing pin, which hits the primer...etc.  However, most modern weapons will not allow the firing pin to touch the back of the cartridge unless the hammer has been cocked first.  There is a mechanism in place that gets between the hammer and the firing pin or prevents the hammer from moving forward unless it's been cocked and/or the trigger is pulled.  With those weapons, you can bang on it as hard as you want and it will not go off... \\*\n\n\\* Until the gunpowder ignites from the shock, which is a thing gunpowder can do.  It's *possible* that if you dropped a gun from high enough the sheer force of hitting the ground would set off the gunpowder, but...that's not a realistic possibility.  It certainly won't happen from you dropping it from your hand onto the ground.\n\nIt *used* to be more common, partly because guns were not designed with the safety features to prevent the firing pin from touching the cartridge.  Older guns simply rested the firing pin against the back of the cartridge, and the hammer against the firing pin when it wasn't cocked.  Obviously, this is pretty unsafe, but hey, guns were still being improved upon so no one had anything better at the time.  We have also significantly improved our understanding of gun safety when we handle weapons so people to know better than to keep a gun cocked when you aren't about to immediately fire it, and technologies like double-action weapons have allowed people to be more comfortable because they don't need to have the weapon cocked before the gunfight starts.  Today it's very uncommon, unless someone is mishandling the gun, the mechanism is malfunctioning, or most likely, both.",
                "Some older single action revolvers when fully loaded with 6 rounds have the firing pin resting on the primer of one of the bullets. Since they have no safety, a bump on the hammer can fire the bullet. Modern revolvers have a safety that blocks the firing pin from the primer until the trigger is pulled. \n\nHere is a good demonstration of this _URL_0_\n",
                "It was somewhat true in the days of old with revolvers where the hammer rested close or directly on the primer of a cartridge. But in modern weapons misfires from dropping have been almost eliminated. There was a recall on Remington 700 rifles because they were causing misfired without pulling the trigger, but only when it was cocked and not on safe. Again though it was recalled. \n\nThe mechanism that stops misfires from the hammer directly contacting the primer is very present in the M9/ 92FS series pistols that the military uses. The weapon will not fire unless the trigger is pulled. There is a piece of metal in between the firing pin and the primer of the bullet. This piece will only move unless the trigger is pulled because the trigger is directly connected to this piece. So I can slam the pistol down, throw it, or otherwise try to cause a misfire and it will not unless that trigger is pulled. It also helps that the trigger is fairly heavy, so it falling cannot cause enough energy to transfer into the trigger for it to get pulled, which is what was causing the misfires in the Remington rifles. ",
                "Nope.  This is Hollywood nonsense. Modern guns do not discharge when they hit the ground.  In fact, most people will tell you that if you drop a gun it is safer to let it just hit the ground than attempt to catch it.  \n\nThe only times a gun will discharge on impact is (1) you are using an antique gun design, like a Colt SAA or (2) the gun is damaged and mechanically defective.\n\nThat scene in True Lies with the Mac 10 is total nonsense.",
                "It depends on the gun. Some do though. When people think of  gun they tend to think of something like a revolver or an 1911 pistol, both of which have a hammer that gets pulled back in order to fire. Many guns use an internal firing pin though that is not like a hammer, its more like a spring loaded nail that gets pulled back and compresses a spring, and when you fire, the sharp pin is pushed forward by the spring and strikes the firing cap on the back of the round. \n\nWhen a gun is dropped it is possible for the shock of landing to push the firing pin back only to have the spring snap it forward again, firing the weapon. You have to put a specific mechanism in place that doesn't allow the firing pin to move unless the trigger is squeezed. \n\nFor instance I own a Glock 17c which has a little mechanism on the trigger and the firing pin cannot strike unless the trigger is depressed. So a Glock cannot fire from dropping it if it's working properly. The Glock does not have a manual safety though so if it is cocked, it will always fire if the trigger is pulled and there is no way to prevent that other than to eject the magazine and un-chamber the round. Glock owners will usually tell you that with a Glock the safety is 'between your ears' IE you don't put your finger on the trigger unless you are prepared to destroy what it is aiming at. \n\nGuns like the 1911 on the other hand can block the hammer and prevent the weapon from discharging, but if there is a firing pin it doesn't always immobilize it so it's possible if struck against the ground for the weapon to fire even safed.

                "I saw your previous question,  I'm glad you came back for another shot. \n\nThe long and short of it comes down to *how small* of a group is required for oligarchy. Certainly for the first 145 or so years of US history, only a minority of citizens had the legal right to vote. This started with white, male property owners. The last property requirements for voting were finally abolished shortly before the Civil War. Then, for another 55 years after that, women were still not given the franchise until the passage of the 19th amendment in 1920. Only at this point can we safely say that a majority of American citizens had the legal right to cast a vote at the ballot box - that is, all white people. Of course, African-Americans were only given actual access to the ballot box in the 60s with the Civil Rights Movement and the Voting Rights Act. But this is just the legal sense of the term; it's just who has the theoretical legal right to vote, not who *actually votes*. \n\nGiven that voter turnout for presidential elections generally hovers in the high 50% range, and that it is much, much lower for off-year Congressional, all state, and all locals elections, one could convincingly make the argument that only a small group of people are *actually* exercising any control over the government through the ballot box, regardless of whether or not those people who are not taking part have a right to do so or not. \n\nAll of this doesn't even touch on the question of class - whether the \"rich and powerful\" or \"special interests\" are able to use their influence to the detriment of the rest. I'm sure there are lots of arguments that can be made for and against that claim, and I'm just not qualified - or willing - to jump down that rabbit hole at the moment. "

This is how new flu viruses are thought to come about, they mix and match their genes and re-emerge as new, more virulent strains.\n\nSome viruses can ONLY reproduce when its co infecting. The best example I know of this is Hepatitis D virus. By itself, it can do nothing, but if it infects along side Hep B virus, it can spread. It uses some of the Hep B machinery and Hep B surface proteins. ",
                "Yes this is possible. And it can have some terrifying effects.\n\nTracing HIV back to its origins (by looking at similar viruses), it appears that 2 monkey viruses, from 2 different species of monkey, were present in the same cell at the same time and mutated together. This mutant hybrid of both viruses made its way into a human (probably through a monkey bite).\n\nThis is not particularly hard for viruses to bond together, especially retro-viruses like HIV. They don't have DNA, they're just a chain of RNA that hijacks a ribosome to replicate. Since they're jacking the system, it's easy for \"normal\" protein synthesis to get disturbed and 2 virus chains to conjoin - well, much easier than the same thing occurring between Eukaryote genes."

                "They can't, which is why literary scholars around the 1940s, in the era called \"new criticism,\" thought authorial intent was irrelevant. Now, literary theory has changed a lot since then and many might say that the new critics went too far, but you still aren't going to find \"what was the author thinking?\" to be a primary question in academic circles very often.\n\nI mean, even if you have an interview with the author where he says \"This book is about true love.\" the author might become cynical when they are older and say \"Actually, I had no idea what true love was when I wrote that.

A good example (not painting related) is the amount of scholarship on the music and performance style of JS Bach that is based entirely on his local church's records of payments made to musicians each week. This seems like a random piece of information but it enables us to know how many actual human beings Bach had to work with, the constraints he had to manage, and his *likely* thought processes in writing his music. This actually led to a revolution over the past ~20 years in how his music is performed. "

                "So this is kind of a complex question and I have done my best to answer it by referring to the history of memorial representations in Cambodia following the Khmer Rouge being toppled in 1979. To summarise, it was a politicised image \\- and one that has been built upon by a succession of journalists and now foreign tourists. It is also a visually striking image and one utilised to inform in a very base/human way the almost unfathomable suffering of the Democratic Kampuchea period. \n\nThe image of the skull, or skulls \\- or piles of skulls \\- had been adopted by Mai Lam, who was a Vietnamese Colonel fluent in Khmer and had extensive experience in legal studies and museology, from the earliest points after the S\\-21 security centre was turned into the 'tuol sleng museum of genocidal crimes'. A large painting of a map of Cambodia, filled with skulls, and rivers of blood was on display until 2002, similar paintings hang in the museum today. The crimes of the Khmer Rouge were politicised by the new government in Cambodia which was essentially under Vietnamese suzerainty. Without going into too much detail \\- there is a reason that the museum at S\\-21 was made to be very reminiscent of museums associated with Nazi concentration camps. The idea of the exhibit was to \\(according to David Chandler\\) 'deny the the leaders of the CPK \\(communist party of kampuchea\\) any socialist credentials and encourage viewers to make connections between the DK regime \\(democratic Kampuchea\\) and Tuol Sleng on the one hand and Nazi Germany and Auschwitz on the other'. Remember at this time the communist Vietnamese were seen in some circles to have invaded Cambodia illegitimately \\(The US and China managed to keep the KR in their seat at the UN\\). The PRK government in Cambodia based its legitimacy on the fact that it had toppled a 'genocidal regime' \\(rather than a callous, radically marxist one\\), however it was in no position to condemn the entire movement as so many prominent figures in this new government were former Khmer Rouge Cadre until they had defected to Vietnam in 1977 and 1978.\n\nSo you have a situation wherein the new government is trying its hardest to be highly explicit in its condemnation of the very top leaders of the Khmer Rouge, they were tried in absentia and sentenced to death in 1979 in the first tribunal to accuse the 'Pol Pot Ieng Sary Clique' of genocide \\(the second is ongoing\\). In evidencing these accusations it became prudent to highlight to the world what the worst aspects of the Khmer Rouge period were \\- and one of the most straightforward ways of doing this would be to expose and excavate the hundreds of thousands of dead bodies which had been victims of execution during the regime. The so called 'killing fields' were dug up, and photographed. It is way too cynical to say that this was only done to prove a political point \\- obviously there is an historical and human element to digging up this tragedy \\- but when you visit places like Tuol Sleng, or its accompanying murder site Cheoung Ek \\(or the Killing Caves at Phnom Sampeau that you seem to be referencing in your question\\), the very explicit exhibits of bones and skulls stacked up behind glass is meant to viscerally remind the onlooker of the tragedy that befell Cambodia \\(and maybe who stopped it as well\\).\n\nI'm afraid I cannot right now give you an accurate answer as to when these images of skull piles began to be a prominent image associated with Cambodia. The Toul Sleng museum opened in 1979 \\(the blood and hair of prisoners was still visible on the floor to these early visitors\\) and international visitors were the only ones allowed for around a year. In this time period John Pilger published his influential documentary 'Cambodia Year Zero' but while there are a few shots of a broken skull there were no piles of bones depicted. Similarly in 1984 'the killing fields' by Roland Joffe was released to much acclaim and the 'idea' of Cambodia and the devastation of the Khmer Rouge was solidified in the western consciousness, one scene depicts a vast waterlogged bone field. I don't have evidence for this but I would assume in the mid 1980s once the memorial stupa was erected in Cheoung Ek \\(the large column containing thousands of skulls behind glass\\) the image may have become more prominent. As this 'killing field' and the museum at S\\-21 are basically locked in for any tourist going to Cambodia it would make sense for the striking images and photos of skulls to be disseminated into the wider 'western image' of Cambodia from this point on. In the mid 90's when the UN transitional peace process occurred there was a wider interest in Cambodia again as it was seen as 'opening up' following the Cold War. Around this time Ben Kiernan publishes the 'Pol Pot Regime', the cover of which is just a photo of skulls excavated with blindfolds still attached. There is a long tradition of books on the subject employing this kind of imagery \\- and for good reason, it is a striking image from a sales point of view.\n\nAs for why the skulls are often arranged in this particular way? I am unaware if there is any cultural significance of the glass, or the arrangement of the skulls in this imposing manner. I have seen many photos of other mass graves excavations around the country and the skulls are often stacked or laid out, it may be a helpful way to account for the number of dead in any given killing site. As for the more 'elaborate' installations near the capital, Mai Lam had also worked on the Vietnam War atrocity museum where the idea is to really move an audience or visitor. I would presume that the arrangement of the skulls is done to primarily shock the viewer, both young and old Cambodians and maybe even more importantly the international visitor. It is actually a fairly alien custom to the Khmer, who are around 92 & #37; Theravada Buddhist, to not properly bury their dead or cremate them. It is thought the dead may not find peace if they are not properly buried. As I alluded to previously \\- these kinds of ossuary have two primary purposes: to shock and remind people of the Khmer Rouge period, and in doing so legitimise the government that toppled the callous regime responsible for these atrocities \\- and the second being one more traditionally associated with memorial.\n\nA more simple answer may be that people are fascinated with these kinds of morbid tourist attractions \\- I would guarantee that 4/5 people you know who have visited Cambodia have a photo with them next to one of the exhibits of skulls at S\\-21 or Cheoung Ek. At the National Gallery of Victoria a recent exhibit by Ron Mueck entitled \"MASS\" \\- gigantic white skulls spread throughout a room \\- is directly influenced by exhibits like those in Cambodia or Rwanda. For many, myself included, seeing the nightmare of the Khmer Rouge regime represented in fields of bones and skulls is an enduring and powerful image, it makes sense that it is so often associated in the western consciousness with Cambodia.\n\nA good secondary source to consult for this is David Chandler's \"Voices From S\\-21: Terror and History in Pol Pot's Secret Prison\", as well as articles like Madness and Mayhem: The Aesthetics of Dark Tourism by Collette Copeland."

                "(Part 1)\n\nIn the 1950s, there was a distinct divide between major and minor record labels in the USA. The minor record labels were often regionally-based, and because of their 'minor' status - that is, they were not particularly large - they did not always have consistent, national distribution of their records to record stores. In 2017, it's worth remembering that, in the 1950s, if you wanted to hear recorded music at a time of your choosing, you had to have access to spinning discs like 7\" vinyl records - there were no Spotify, no iPods, etc - on a record player or perhaps a jukebox. Someone needed to physically drive these 7\" records to record stores in places like Alabama, Oregon and Nevada for the song to have any chance in the national charts, and having a national network of people doing this distribution is therefore expensive, and much cheaper and easier if you have lots of records to regularly put in the shops that have a good chance of getting sold.\n\nMinor record labels often found themselves in shallow waters financially, because payments by distributors and royalty payments etc tended to lag - minor record labels often went out of business *because* they had a hit (and so they might, say, have overspent borrowed money on pressing 1.5 million copies, when it had only sold 1 million copies, because while there was still demand when decided to print more, the demand had died down by the time they were pressed and distributed). Which is to say that there was not much money in minor record labels in the 1950s, and plenty of shonky operators who would fleece artists in order to increase their share of the takings/keep the record company afloat while they waited for money to trickle back from the distributors (if it ever did) to pay their creditors with. As a result, it was very typical for rhythm  &  blues acts on minor record labels to be paid a small lump sum fee for their recording - $30, perhaps - and to not expect much more even if the song was a #1 hit on the R & B charts.\n\nIn contrast, there was more money to be made in the (somewhat more staid) world of major record labels. These labels did have consistent national distribution, because they were not specialty labels - a major label like Capitol or RCA in the 1950s in the US put out everything from jazz to pop to classical music to country music. Because these labels had deeper pockets, pressing plants of their own, and better communication with their distributors (typically, they were the distributors), they could much more easily keep up with demand for records. And because of their deeper pockets, they had much stronger, more consistent promotion of their artists, and could weather (for example) printing too many copies of a popular disc much more easily than a minor label. As a result, they were generally also much more conservative than the minor labels, and much less willing to take risks on a fad like rock  &  roll that would probably be over in a year or two.\n\nHere is a table of which rock and roll acts pre-The Beatles' 'Love Me Do' were on which labels, with the white acts in italics:\n\nArtist | Major Label | Minor Label\n---|---|----\n*Bill Haley  &  The Comets* | Decca | -\nFats Domino | - | Imperial\nLittle Richard | - | Specialty\nChuck Berry | - | Chess\n*Elvis Presley* | RCA (1956-) | Sun (1953-1956)\n*Buddy Holly/The Crickets* | Coral/Brunswick (subsidiaries of Decca) | -\n*The Everly Brothers* | Warner Bros (1960-) | Cadence (1955-1959)\n*Jerry Lee Lewis* | - | Sun Records (1956-) \n*Pat Boone* | - | Dot Records (1954-)\nThe Coasters/The Drifters | - | Atlantic Records\nRay Charles | ABC Records (1960-) | Atlantic Records (1952-1959)\nBo Diddley | - | Chess Records\n*Gene Vincent* | Capitol | -\n*Eddie Cochran* | - | Liberty\n*Johnny  &  Dorsey Burnette* | Coral | - \n*Carl Perkins* | Columbia (1958-) | Sun Records (1955-1958)\n\n. \n\nThat list should make it fairly clear that, generally, where the major record labels deigned to notice that rock  &  roll even existed - and there was a lot of pushback by the major labels against what they thought was little more than degenerate noise - the major labels were going to be signing nice white boys who were presumably, in their eyes, less dangerous and more marketable. It was therefore almost always the white rock  &  roll artists who had access to the superior moneymaking potential of major labels. And yes, there was absolutely an element of racism in this, whether it was the public's racism, the record executive's perceptions of the public's racism, or the record executive's racism. Remember that the rock  &  roll era occurred before the Civil Rights act, and that an Elvis Presley had a *much* easier time touring large swathes of America than a Chuck Berry did.\n\nIn terms of the more famous individual white rock  &  roll acts, the obvious one to start with is Elvis: \n\nElvis Presley spent much of his rock  &  roll years before he went into the army covering African-American artists. Unlike Pat Boone (who we'll get to later), Presley had a definite love for R & B music, and his Sun Records singles demonstrates Elvis's relatively obscure taste in R & B; ['Mystery Train'](_URL_7_) is a [Junior Parker cover](_URL_13_), ['Good Rockin' Tonight'](_URL_5_) is a [Roy Brown cover](_URL_9_), while ['That's All Right'](_URL_4_) is [an Arthur Crudup cover](_URL_2_) (all black artists). When Elvis moved to RCA, his two 1956 albums, *Elvis* and *Elvis Presley* are full of covers of black artists, from [Ray Charles' 'I Got A Woman'](_URL_8_), and a bunch of Little Richard songs - ['Tutti Frutti'](_URL_6_), 'Ready Teddy', and 'Long Tall Sally'. The 1956 single ['Hound Dog' was originally by Big Mama Thornton](_URL_1_), and a bunch of new songs were written for Elvis by the African-American songwriter Otis Blackwell such as 'All Shook Up', 'Don't Be Cruel' and 'Return To Sender'. \n\nPeter Guralnick's 1971 book *Feel Like Going Home* quotes Sam Phillips of Sun Records as saying \"If I could find a white man who had the Negro sound and the Negro feel, I could make a billion dollars\"; pre-Elvis, Sun Records had made a name for itself by recording Memphis blues musicians like B.B. King. In a footnote in Guralnick's study of Elvis, *Last Train To Memphis*, Guralnick confirms the accuracy of the quote, but also points out its irony; this was more Phillips frustrated that the great music he was recording wasn't getting its due than a man with dollar signs in his eyes. Nonetheless, once Phillips discovered that a shy young country singer called Elvis Presley was a fan of R & B music, he was in the right place and at the right time to exploit it.\n\nAnother ...interesting case on that list is Pat Boone. Boone was on a minor label, Dot Records, who were nonetheless a reasonably well-established light-entertainment-pop-focused minor label. Dot Records deliberately saw their college-boy crooner Pat Boone as someone who would have the clean cut white boy looks to get away with singing ['Ain't That A Shame'](_URL_12_) ([originally by Fats Domino](_URL_0_)) and ['Tutti Frutti'](_URL_14_) (again). Pat Boone famously hated the 'blunt and ungrammatical' approach of the rhythm  &  blues tunes he was covering, so he really was only singing previously popular R & B songs for the money/fame. And, judging by his (60 years later, almost comical) approach to 'Tutti Frutti', he clearly did not *get* the music. Nonetheless, Little Richard's 'Tutti Frutti' got to #17 on the Billboard charts, and Pat Boone's got to #11. Fats Domino's version of 'Ain't That A Shame' got to #10, and Pat Boone's got to #1. Little Richard has a few different versions of the same quote about his feelings on Pat Boone, including [one in the 1990s BBC series *Dancing In The Street*](_URL_10_); the 1984 one quoted by Wikipedia explains it just as well as any: \n\n >  \"They didn’t want me to be in the white guys' way. ... I felt I was pushed into a rhythm and blues corner to keep out of rockers' way, because that’s where the money is. When 'Tutti Frutti' came out. ... They needed a rock star to block me out of white homes because I was a hero to white kids. The white kids would have Pat Boone upon the dresser and me in the drawer 'cause they liked my version better, but the families didn't want me because of the image that I was projecting.\"\n\nOther white artists were less reliant on songs already made popular in R & B circles by black artists, however. The Everly Brothers relied heavily on the songwriting of husband and wife team Felice  &  Boudleaux Bryant, while Buddy Holly was a fine songwriter in his own right (whose [covers of 'Bo Diddley'](_URL_11_) by [Bo Diddley](_URL_3_) and 'Brown Eyed Handsome Man' by Chuck Berry were only released after his death).\n\nAll of which does pretty clearly show that simply being a handsome white boy certainly made it easier to a) get atop the charts singing the same tunes as the black guys but not as well, and b) get a major label record contract.

                "I know you've asked this question (or questions similar to it) several times now, and I've been waiting to answer in hopes that I might be proven wrong. But there's no evidence that I'm aware of for European or Muslim troops adopting each other's equipment during the Third Crusade; one expects that, if they were going to, they would have done so some time in the previous one hundred years, rather than during an active campaign. The only source I'm aware of that even describes individual equipment to any great extent is Baha al-Din, who emphasized the protective qualities of the Europeans' armor, consisting of both mail and some variety of felt vest that excelled at stopping arrows. I can't emphasize enough that most medieval sources are *terrible* for understanding the small details of military life. They are, in the main, concerned with narrative (and glorification of aristocratic sponsors). Tables of equipment, casualty reports, payrolls: we have none of these things for the Third Crusade.",
                "Probably not, no. \n\nEquipment in crusade warfare was based on the user's tactical approach to battle; these were fairly incompatible between the Christian and Muslim armies. \n\nIt is likely that Arab use of longer lances stemmed from their experiences fighting Franks: the equipment of the Crusader forces favoured close combat and so lances allowed for Arab fighters to engage from a greater distance. However, these were not Frankish lances, nor were they copies. These lances, especially those employed by the Turks, were much lighter. \n\nLikewise, the Muslim armies were equipped with shields but these were not the shields of the Franks. Arab shields were smaller (round, not 'kite-shaped') and also lighter. The theme of weight reduction should be becoming self-evident here: the tactical approach of the Muslim armies was overwhelming that of mobility. \n\nThe Frankish *milites* were increasingly armoured. Mail flowed increasingly over the extremities, into considerable skirts, over hands and into loops around the neck and face. A Muslim outfit not serve a Frank, nor would a Frank's equipment benefit an Muslim, because each is tailored very specifically to their respective culture's ideas on warfare.  \n\nWould weapons have been re-purposed on the battlefield? Logically we would yes, almost certainly. Do we have evidence that it was widespread or institutional? No. \n\nFor more information please consider *Crusading Warfare, 1097-1193* by **R.C. Smail**. "

                "As a follow up question, is this that abnormal for the time? Or has there been a pattern of taxless governance in the past?",
                "I suspect that the claim in the video you're referring to is based on a misunderstanding. Alexander didn't abolish all taxes. Wherever he went during his conquest of Asia, our sources report that he levied specific amounts of tribute or tax - usually at the same level as the Persians had done previously. For instance, when he replaced the satrap of Phrygia in Asia Minor:\n\n >  He made Kalas satrap of the satrapy which Arsites had held, ordering the inhabitants to pay the same taxes that they had previously paid to Dareios.\n\n-- Arrian, *Anabasis* 1.17.1\n\nShortly afterwards, an officer named Nikias is assigned to oversee \"the taxes, contributions and tribute\" levied from Lydia (Arr. *An.* 1.17.7). Clearly, the people were still expected to pay up.\n\nIndeed, it was Alexander's habit to pay the debts *and lift the tax obligations* on his own officers and soldiers (or to their surviving kin) as a reward for brave conduct in battle. On one occasion he abolished all taxes from a particular town because it claimed to be a colony of Argos, which was the home of Alexander's supposed ancestors (Arr. *An.* 2.5.9). Gestures like these obviously wouldn't make much sense if these people were not paying tax in the first place.\n\nSo what is causing the confusion? It is probably the fact that when Alexander first liberated the Greeks of Asia Minor, he freed them from the tribute that had been imposed by the Persians. This sounds an awful lot like he abolished taxes. However, he immediately replaced them with a fixed \"contribution\" which the Greek cities were to make to the common cause (i.e. waging war on the Persians). Their tax burden may have been lower, but it was certainly not abolished as a matter of principle.\n\nThat said, Alexander followed in his father's footsteps in cultivating an image of peerless generosity, which drove state expenses far beyond what any previous polity west of Persia could have sustained. His feasts and rounds of rewards for his troops could cost many thousands of talents each. On one occasion, Alexander spent about as much on a single celebration in Babylon as the entire silver reserve stockpiled by Athens for the Peloponnesian War. In addition, the sheer expense of maintaining a professional army - let alone one the size of Alexander's expeditionary force - would have been insurmountable to any Greek state. In short, Alexander needed stupendous amounts of money to sustain his conquests, and traditional means of gathering revenue weren't going to cut it.\n\nIt made sense for Alexander to avoid trying to make up the shortfall by raising additional tribute from the lands he took. Firstly, even if his revenue stream could be doubled or tripled, it would not have covered his costs. Secondly, the heavier the burden of tribute, the more likely it was that conquered regions would try to throw off his yoke. This would require larger garrisons, which in turn would drive up expenses. There was a major problem of diminishing returns in the notion of raising more taxes. Instead, the examples above suggest that Alexander generally kept tribute levels as they were, except in those cases (the Greeks of Asia Minor, the descendants of Argives, the fallen among his troops) where there was a clear propaganda coup to be made by abolishing them. But where else could he get the funds he needed?\n\nFor Alexander's father, the solution had been the conquest of the silver and gold mines at Amphipolis. This breakaway Athenian colony was adjacent to Macedon and fell under Philip's sway early in his reign; after expansion of its mines, its yearly revenue was said to be upwards of 1,000 talents (Diodoros 16.8.6) - as much as the tribute of the entire Athenian empire at the height of its power. For Philip, this bullion appears to have sufficed to build his professional army and establish his rule over Epiros, Thrace and mainland Greece. For Alexander, it would have provided a solid foundation for his finances. But at the scale at which Alexander operated, it was nowhere near enough money.\n\nAlexander's answer was simple: that which he could not provide for himself would have to be taken from others. Specifically, his campaign against the Persians largely succeeded in funding itself, through the \"liberation\" of staggering quantities of stockpiled Persian gold. When Alexander captured Sardis in Asia Minor, he seized 40,000 talents; in his campaign overall, including the spectacular plunder from the palace at Persepolis, we can calculate that he may have captured in the region of 250,000 talents of Persian gold. If Herodotos was right to estimate the total tribute of the Persian empire at c. 14,500 talents a year, Alexander released for his conquests a sum of money equal to 17 years of collected tribute from the largest empire in the world. This, and only this, allowed Alexander to be simultaneously as warlike and as generous as he was famed to be."

                "There is a pretty big divide both chronologically and stylistically between the Baroque and Classical periods. I'm going to speak to individual composers.\n\nBach was well known locally, he was a renowned organist and wrote hundreds of pieces of church music that would be heard often by people of all income levels. In addition, he was an influential teacher and led choirs. He was not known to the general public outside the areas where he lived until well after his death. His vocal music became popular in the 1830s. Bach's keyboard works were studied and played widely, but were rarely performed in public until further into the 19th century. \n\nHandel and Scarlatti were both international stars in composing circles, and were both contemporaries and rivals. They ended up working in the courts of England and Spain, respectively, and Handel especially composed many pieces that would be heard by the general public: fanfares/oratorios/music for festivals and holidays, etc.\n\nBefore Mozart, traveling performing musicians were viewed more like oddities or circus performers to the general public. We know that Mozart and his contemporaries were all stellar improvisors, and would have a repertoire of folk and pop (opera) tunes that they could play and improvise off of on command. This implies that in addition to performing for royalty they would have performed for middle class audiences. There have been debates among musicologists about *who* Mozart wrote his pieces for, upper classes or lower (or both). His music was incredibly accessible to everybody regardless of education level during his time period, yet he wrote with finesse and showed an understanding of theory and form that only musically inclined intellectuals would pick up on. I don't know the current status of this debate though.\n\nBeethoven wrote pieces based off of \"Gassenhauers\", the equivalent of hit singles. The last movement of his Op. 11 Piano Trio is a theme and variations on a song that was sung throughout the lower class and would have been familiar to them at least. He was also important because he was one of the first composers to work independently of a patron. Once Beethoven went deaf he made his living off of selling scores of his music and commissions from wealthy people, but reviews of his music in newspapers suggest that his large scale works would have been largely recognized by the public."

Patton would use \"Mongol\" to describe people that modern Americans would describe as \"Asian,\" similar to how he would use \"Negro\" when modern Americans would use \"black\" or \"African-American.\"  \n\n[Here's](_URL_0_) an example of how ethnicity was categorized in the 19th century when Patton was born.   So to answer your question, calling someone Mongolian or mongoloid  in 1945 means something similar to calling someone \"Asian\" today.  \n\nOf course, most people in 1945 would ascribe traits such as deviousness or inscrutability to someone described as \"mongoloid\" or Asian.  Patton does so in the passage you're referring to.\n\n > The difficulty in understanding the Russian is that we do not take cognizance of the fact that he is not a European but an Asiatic and therefore thinks deviously. We can no more understand a Russian than a Chinaman or a Japanese and, from what I have seen of them, I have no particular desire to understand them except to ascertain how much lead or iron it takes to kill them. In addition to his other amiable characteristics, the Russian has no regard for human life and is an all out son of a bitch, a barbarian, and a chronic drunk."

You want experts on periods _prior_ to the Cold War. \n\nIt is worth noting that pretty much all of the millenarians of the past — the people who believed the world was close to ending — believed it was going to be because of divine intervention, e.g. rapture or apocalypse or what have you. In such a situation a bug-out bag is probably not going to make the difference, or even be a good idea.

                "Not sure on the specifics of this particular application/design, but there are a few ways you could make that happen. Note that a boat sail doesn't go perfectly perpendicular to the air flow: the ropes and shape hold it at an angle.\n\nFirst of all, the air being caught by the chutes pours out of the sides. This pushes against the air from the other chutes and pushes them apart. This might be the only thing going on in some designs. \n\nAs far as design possibilities go, where the rope splits into multiple ropes that attach to the parachute in different places at the top, it can split into different lengths. The difference might not be much, but it's enough for the force of the air to tilt the parachute (it will stay full and the ropes will stay tight due to the forces). The parachute can also be made asymmetrically to let a bit more air out of one side, making the parachute push in the opposite direction and pushing the other parachutes away.\n\n It looked like the three deployed together, ~~so there may be some sort of weak attachment holding them together and facing correctly that pops off when they inflate.~~ **EDIT: after further research, this seems to be done with very careful rigging, not some breakaway device.** As far as stopping them from rotating to steer into each other, it's just a matter of making sure that the forces pushing them away are stronger and that the equilibrium point is 3 equally spaced parachutes 120 degrees from each other. In other words, you design them so that if one starts to drift out of place, it creates some airflow that pushes it back. This is mostly from the air pouring out of the sides of the other parachutes. Edit: _URL_1_ Note the ports in the side of the parachute. This is the only place for air to escape, other than bending around the bottom. As far as the air escaping from the bottom goes: _URL_0_ Note the jet of air pouring out of the downwind side here (thick red line). With the three parachutes angled as they are, this is pointed toward the middle.\n\n**Tl;dr: Parachutes deflect air toward each other, pushing apart. They may also be designed to be at an angle when pulled tight.**",
                "Once fully inflated, the air pressure contained by each of the parachutes give a certain structure/rigidity to each chute, keeping them from collapsing when they come together (the pressure inside of each parachute will be equal, so no one parachute is more rigid/hard than another). \n\nAs far as the angles are concerned, that is just physics. they are counterbalancing each other in such way that there is enough outward \"pull\" on each one so as to avoid coming to close. The angles on the strapping (connecting it/them to the capsule) are not forced into place by anything other than this counterbalance as far as I know (the engineers will have accounted for this based off of the weight of the payload vs. the braking force generated by each parachute).\n\nAnother design feature of these re-entry/ cargo type parachutes is the very long shroud lines. When compared, the shroud lines on a Army Paratroopers parachute are much shorter(relatively). The longer shroud lines allow the steeper angle with with multiple parachutes. (Imagine, for a moment, if they were superrr short, as a hyperbole. They wouldn't be able to face downward as much, more angled, as it were.) ",
                "_URL_0_\nbetter vid of the parachutes opening up.  \n\n\nno idea about the wind dynamics. \nthe vid shows two chutes are lauched together first. then they launch the third parachute. \n\nafter all three are at full length, the chutes  catch wind and ooen up to its max size.",
                "It depends on the parachute types. Those big parachutes that you see landing the capsules for Apollo, SpaceX, Orion, etc., have a certain angle that they want to be at. This is called a \"trim angle,\" which is the angle from the vertical. It's partly because there is so much fabric compared to open spaces, but air wants to dump out of the canopy. The slots and vent opening don't give enough open spaces, so the parachute tilts to the side. How much it tilts to the side is the trim angle. There are nice curves that show stability with regards to the angle.\n\nYou don't want to make the suspension lines different lengths. That would be silly. For one, it would be obnoxious to pack. And the loads on the lines would be wildly different, which would be awful to design for. Also you wouldn't/couldn't add some kind of spacer or whatever. Each main is packed into a separate bag in its own bay. How would you have some connecting piece that goes from main to main, all the way inside the bag?\n\nFor other parachutes, like the pilots that pull out the mains, or the drogues that provide the initial deceleration and stabilization, there is a higher ratio of open space to fabric. The capsule also goes a lot faster under these parachutes, so the trim angle isn't being sought as much.\n\nIf you're really curious, you should read [Knacke's Parachute Recovery Systems Design Manual](_URL_0_).\n\nSource: I design parachutes for a living.",
                "It happens naturally, you're absolutely right that there is an inclination for the parachutes to go to a position where the centre of mass is below them.\n\nBut there are also aerodynamic effects that result in the parachutes staying open and keeping separate because the air they don't 'capture' (for want of a better word) rush between the gaps and push them apart.\n\n[This paper on the aerodynamic of parachute clusters](_URL_0_) has some nice pictures that show the fluid dynamics between the parachutes (pg 971).\n\nThe reason for the separation is that the air that isn't 'captured' by the parachute cluster flows between the individual parachutes before doing complex things in the low pressure region on the upper sides of the canopies. The net affect is the individual parachutes stay apart.\n\nYou're absolutely right to think the parachutes should collapse to the middle with the centre of mass below them - but thats only considering from a statics pov.  \n\nThe aerodynamic affects of the air flow between the parachutes and into the low pressure regions above the canopies as well as the interaction of the vortices that result over come that 'statics problem'\n\n",
                "Actually they do crash into each other. Particularly after opening (or disreefing as referred to in parachute lingo) the parachutes fly out and then come back in and crash together. \n\nParachute contact is undesirable because 1) it adds to the risk of canopy deflation 2) the descent speed increases when the parachutes contact as the aerodynamic frontal area of the system is reduced. \n\nIn order to help the system stability you can see spacex and Apollo and even Orion have missing panels in the canopy. The holes slightly increase the descent rate but greatly increase stability. \n\nSource: Masters thesis on thr Orion parachute system. "

However the amount is negligable for ship movement perspective and only relevant to aiming.\n\nThere are a lot of answers on how much a battleship moves from full broadsides, but its generally agreed to be negligable if it moves lateraly at all. \n\nHere is a video of the [USS Missouri firing full broadsides](_URL_0_) At what looks to be 30 degrees. Since the ship is underway its a little difficult to tell but it seems that the motion of the water plays more of a role in the ships lateral movement and roll then firing the guns multiple times. "

                "Your body vomits when it senses various different threats. These threats can take the form of toxic chemicals or stress hormones in the blood, swaying motions, or an upset stomach. Chemicals and hormones are detected by the brain’s chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ), swaying motions are detected by the inner ear, while an upset stomach is identified by the vagus nerve. Once the signal for a need to vomit arrives at the CTZ, it sets off a chain reaction.\n\nIn the Brainstem - The chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) receives a stimulus that might warrant vomiting. The vomiting centre begins a choreographed sequence of actions.\n\nThe  Salivary glands -  Your mouth suddenly begins producing extra saliva. This is slightly alkaline and forms a buffer to protect your mouth and teeth from incoming stomach acid.\n\nThe Diaphragm - You take a deep breath to avoid getting vomit in your lungs, then the diaphragm contracts in a few short pulses, squeezing the stomach to create pressure.\n\nThe Glottis - The glottis closes, sealing the airway. Nothing enters or leaves the lungs. Diaphragm contractions without vomiting cause dry heaves.\n\nAbdominal muscles - The abdominal muscles contract to further increase pressure. The pyloric sphincter at the bottom of the stomach is held closed. The only way out is upwards.\n\nThe Skin - The sympathetic nervous system raises your heart rate and makes you sweat across your whole body, to shed the heat from this sudden exertion.\n\n & #x200B;\n\nsource : [_URL_0_](_URL_0_)",
                "For substances that are perceived as acutely toxic to the stomach, you will throw up immediately (e.g. syrup of ipecac will irritate the gastric mucosa). For substances that trigger the CTZ (described in another post), they will induce vomiting a little bit later because the substance needs to enter the bloodstream first and cross the blood brain barrier.\n\nFor the remainder of \"things that make you sick,\" - which is largely limited to infections - they will often produce a 'toxin' of sorts (e.g. C. diff) which only is released once the substance makes its way into the small bowel/colon (remember, food doesn't sit in your stomach for very long. Very little absorption happens there). Bacteria that aren't killed off by the stomach acid will multiply rapidly in your GI tract. So by the time the bacteria/virus/toxins start to cause their damage, they are well in their way into the small bowels. You can't purge your bowels north, so you purge them south.",
                "Commenting for the diarrhea bit:\n\nDiahrrea is when your body throws up out your butt. This is why it's mostly water. If your body detects an irritant or some other pathogen it will signal to have your body fill your intestines with water, flushing out whatevers inside. This is why diahrrea causes dehydration. Your body uses a large quantity of water to flush your guts out, so it doesnt have time to be absorbed by your intestines.",
                "u/jiggity_gee had the best ELI5 answer for this\n\nSo your bowels are like a long train track and your food is like a set of cars on the track. Transit time between Point A, your mouth, and Point B, the chute, is a bit flexible but normally operates on a regularly scheduled basis.\n\nWhen you eat, you put cars on the track and send them to Point B. As these cars go to Point B, they lose passengers (nutrients) at various points in the thin tunnel portion (small intestine). The journey isnt complete and the journey has already altered the shape of the car pretty significantly giving a rusty color. Once in the larger portion of the tunnel, the cars are checked for stray passengers and are hosed down a bit so that transition out of Point B isn't so bad. Sometimes, the train cars park juuust outside the gates of Point B so they can exit at the best time for the operator (toilet).\n\nNow, all of this goes fucking nuts when you load a bad set of train cars at Point A. The track sensors located everywhere along the track, detect this alien set of cars and sends a distress call to the Supervisor (your brain). The Supervisor wants to handle the situation without having to phone the Manager (your consciousness) about the craziness on the tracks and also wants to make sure you never know it was on the tracks. It has to make a choice now: send it back to Point A violently and somewhat painfully risking tearing the tracks, or send it to Point B as fast as fuck? Depending on where it's located on the track, it'll choose the best route.\n\nLet's use the destination Point B. The Supervisor hits the panic button and puts all the train cars that are on the track (in your body) on overdrive. The tunnels are flooded with water and lubricant to speed all the cars up and get them the hell out of there as quickly as possible. Cars collide with each other, and previously well formed cars are just flooded with water and lubricant that they are just a soggy, shadowy reminder of their former glory state.\n\nThe Media (pain) hears about the car collisions immediately begins filming live the high speed, flooded train cars out of control. They want to knos how an alien set of train cars were put on the tracks and they want someone to pay for such carelessness. The Manager is just watching the horror unfold on Live TV but cannot do anything to stop it, because the Supervisor was deaf and he had not installed a means of communicating with him after hours in the office.\n\nI hope this answers your question.\n\nTL;DR when you get diarrhea, everything gets pushed out, one way or another. There are no passing lanes.\n\nSource: medical student"

Get into a Canadian bar?  Fake a Texas driver's license.\n\nID checkers *should* have a book somewhere accessible that shows samples of legitimate IDs from around the world.

                "Creating a fake passport good enough to pass scrutiny at a major western airport would range from extremely difficult to impossible, especially with the introduction of passports containing RFID chips and computers to verify the information on them. So if someone wants to travel under a false identity the most likely thing to do would be to use a stolen passport. It's far easier (though by no means easy) to alter the details in a genuine, stolen passport, than to create a new one from scratch.\n\nThis is one reason why pickpockets and thieves target foreign tourists -- a stolen US or EU passport can be sold for a considerable sum of money on the black market. Quite apart from its use as a fake identity for criminals, it can also be used by would-be illegal immigrants to try to enter a country legitimately."

                "Because meldonium medically has been shown to improve the exercise capacity of injured tissues (for example, injured tissues in the heart in heart attacks), it has been used without any approval for increasing exercise capacity of noninjured tissues (like muscles and a healthy heart). One of the major issues with meldonium is that it's quite unknown. Many of the claims of its performance enhancement are largely untested, but rather used anecdotally and to \"keep up\"  with other athletics trends trends and dopers. \n\nThe mechanism of action would be likely of one of modifying a number of metabolic pathways, some understood (like the one you suggested), and others not well understood.   Our metabolisms are very complex, and many effects have multiple inputs and modifiers. \n\nThe simplistic answer is that it seems to reduce oxidative stress on tissues. \n\nEdit: digging a little deeper into the original research on this compound is kinda weird because it is mostly eastern block stuff.  But I did find this:\n\n_URL_0_",
                "[Meldonium](_URL_2_) is an anti-ischemic drug, which means it increases blood flow to tissues. It has been shown to increase endurance performance in patients with angina, which is a condition brought on by poor blood flow. Increasing blood flow can have a performance enhancing effect for a healthy athlete, which is why meldonium ended up banned starting January 1st 2016 after being on the monitored list, [source](_URL_1_). It is classified as a metabolic modulator on the WADA [Prohibited List](_URL_0_).",
                "According to the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), meldonium acts as a \"metabolic modulator.\"  It improves sports performance by stopping the carnitine activities and stops the mitochondria from being overloaded by fatty acid breakdown during exercise and instead shifts the focus towards breaking down carbohydrates, which requires less oxygen to be taken away from muscles.  By reducing the pressure on the mitochondria, meldonium reduces the amount of urea and lactate in the blood and allows for improved oxygen transport to the muscles to aid not only in performance but in recovery.\n\nSource: _URL_0_",
                "Not to disrespect any of the good answers in this thread, but just to address a broader point, many of these associations are far too heavy handed when it comes to drugs of any kind as a rule. \n\nLook at Ross Rebagliati. He was stripped of his medal when they found traces of marijuana in his blood. Marijuana is clearly not a performance enhancing drug, it's just a drug. But nonetheless it was a banned substance for athletes. There are lots of similar examples, so I don't know if there actually needs to be a sensible justification for the classification in the eyes of many sports associations. ",
                "Additionally: a Russian speedskater and shorttracker have allegedly been caught as well. One is a world record holder and the other a world champion.\n \nApparantly they did so while combatting a heart condition. Impressive.",
                "• Meldonium is used to treat ischaemia: a lack of blood flow to parts of the body, particularly in cases of angina or heart failure.\n\n• It is manufactured in Latvia and only distributed in Baltic countries and Russia. It is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in the United States and is not authorised in the rest of Europe.\n\n• It increases blood flow, which improves exercise capacity in athletes.\n\n• Wada found “evidence of its use by athletes with the intention of enhancing performance” by virtue of carrying more oxygen to muscle tissue.\n\n• The decision to add meldonium to the banned list was approved on 16 September 2015, and it came into effect on 1 January 2016. Wada had spent the previous year monitoring the drug before adding it to the banned list.\n\n• The drug was name-checked in the latest investigative documentary on Russian doping reforms by the German Hajo Seppelt on Sunday. The documentary referred to a 2015 study in which 17% of Russian athletes (724 of 4,316) tested were found to have meldonium in their system. A global study found 2.2% of athletes had it in their system.\n\n• L’Equipe reported that the scientific advisor to the French Agency Against Doping (AFLD), Professor Xavier Bigard, said in interviews with athletes at last year’s European Games in Baku that a wide proportion of athletes admitted taking meldonium.\n\n• It is classed as an S4 substance under the Wada code, which addresses hormone and metabolic modulators.\n\n• The standard ban under the World Anti-Doping Code is four years.\n\n• A memo was sent out to athletes by Russia’s anti-doping agency last September informing them of the decision to ban its use.\n\n• Sharapova says she has been taking the drug for 10 years after she was regularly falling ill. She had a magnesium deficiency and family history of diabetes.\n\n• Several athletes have been suspended since the turn of 2016 after testing positive for the dug. Abebe Aregawi, the 2013 women’s 1,500m world champion, has been provisionally suspended after meldonium was found in an A sample she provided. Endeshaw Negesse, the 2015 Tokyo marathon champion, was also banned after reportedly testing positive for the same substance. Others include Olga Abramova and Artem Tyschcenko, two Ukrainian biathletes, Eduard Vorganov, a Russian cyclist and Ekaterina Bobrova, a Russian ice dancer.\n",
                "Maria Sharapova was apparently taking this for years, and it wasn't banned. Suddenly it's now banned, and her sponsors are either suspending her, or dropping her entirely. Wouldn't it be fair to give her a set amount of time (whatever a doctor recommends) to get off the drug? After all, it was legal until just now. If she suddenly just stopped taking it, this might be very detrimental to her health. It's not like she was taking a substance for years that was actually banned for all those years. ",
                "The real question is, when does something cross the line to become 'performance enhancing?'  From water, to caffeine, to broccoli, to creatine, to steroids.  Everything \"enhances performance\" so to speak.   It gets kind of silly after a while.  What's next? A ban on sugar?",
                "Possibly a naïve question, but could it be the case that she was taking meldonium prior to the January 1 ban and it would still appear positive in testing now?\n\nI only ask because I know some banned/monitored substances can show up months after stopping use.  For example, I'll stopped taking creatine several months before my recent blood test, but my liver results still showed elevated creatinine levels.\n\nEdit: spelling",
                "Given what Maria says about her medical condition (magnesium deficiency and diabetes...etc). What medication would she have been prescribed if she were a regular but active (not obese, not sedentary) person who went to the doctor? Would these medications have been better than meldonium save for the FDA approval?",
                "In a lot simpler terms than the top comment, melodonium basically allows for increased physical endurance through greater blood flow (aka muscles get more blood). Lots of Kenyan runners have been linked to it. It actually wasn't banned in the sport of tennis till this year, so not sure why Sharapova kept taking it.",
                "A lot of people seem to have already explained up how the drug helps performance. Some of you might still be wondering: why won't blocking fatty acid transport into the mitochondria for energy use HAMPER an athlete's performance?\"  \n  \nWell it's simple. Muscles mostly use fatty acids as energy only during rest, so really only at a very basal level. Almost ALL the energy they use for contraction comes from ATP, creatine phosphate, glycogen, and blood glucose.  \n  \nSource: I'm in medical school and had to learn that about a month ago.",
                "If you can follow the below. Basically Meldonium prevents Carnitine production. If you cant form Carnitine you'll have more of the amino acids lysine.

                "Rutherford was influenced by Prout's hypothesis that all atoms were made up of groups of hydrogen atoms, with the hydrogen atom being the fundamental particle. The logic was that the atomic weights known at the time were almost exactly integer multiples of the mass of hydrogen. If there were smaller particles, there would be smaller elements or elements with masses that fell in between multiples of hydrogen. Obviously Rutherford discovered that an atom wasn't just one particle but a positive nucleus surrounded by negative electrons, and then when he observed the process of nitrogen atoms releasing hydrogen atoms when bombarded by alpha particles he took this as evidence that the hydrogen nucleus is indeed the fundamental building block for all other nuclei. This was before the neutron was discovered, it was believed that the nucleus was only made of positive charges.\n\nOf course, protons are actually made up of quarks with fractional charges but there was no way to know that at the time.",

                "Let me preface this by saying that I’m just an undergrad studying nutrition and biochemistry so I am by no means an expert.\n\nThere are three key factors in the breakdown of food in the body:\n\n1. Chemical composition of the food (lipids, carbs, and protein)\n2. Regulatory hormones in the digestive system and;\n3. The thermic effect of food (TEF). \n\nAll are critically important to answering this question. The calorie model is good for the everyday eater because it is extremely simple, calories in = calories out; to maintain weight. There are of course derivations you can think of for losing or gaining weight. This works because calories are simply a measure of heat, so what is really being stated is energy in = energy lost as heat. However, the reality is not so clear cut. \n\nThe calorie system was initially created by literally burning macromolecules to see how much heat is released. It was found that carbohydrates (starches and sugars) released 4Kcal/g, lipids (saturated and unsaturated fats) released 9Kcal/g and protein (amino acids) released 4Kcal/g. It was from this that the calorie system we have today arose. Now, due to the TEF not all macromolecules are equal in the energy required to distribute them throughout the body. Lipids are already close to being in the form that the body likes to store them in, so they take very little energy to break them down (estimates 5-8 Kcal released per 100Kcal lipid) however, proteins and carbohydrates must be broken down into fatty acids which requires a great deal of enzyme activity before they can be stored as fat. For this reason, protein is rarely used in the body to store as fat if the body can avoid it, estimates of 25-35Kcal lost as heat per 100Kcal protein; carbohydrates are somewhere in-between. For this reason, all food is not broken down in the body in the same fashion, and is a reason why some vegetables actually have negative caloric value.\n\nNow, as per your example, consider a cake, let’s break it down into its component parts. 2100 calories in a cake, let’s say 40% is fat (whipped cream, butter, frosting) 55% is carbohydrates (flour, sugar, whipped cream, frosting) and 5% is protein (egg, milk). Desserts and sweets like this are a gold mine for the body, they see this enormous amount of fat and it looks great. The body is specifically programmed to eat as much fat as possible, as it is relatively scarce and is calorically dense. No matter if you eat this all at once, or in small portions, the % comp will remain the same. Therefore, the body is going to go after the fat and store it in fat cells. However, the key to this problem is the question of which method will store more fat as triglycerides in the adipose cells? \n\n**Let me stop here and say the following is speculation from what I’ve learned in school, I’d love for someone in the know to correct me if I’m wrong. \n\nWhen you eat the entire cake all at once, the body cannot physically digest the entire thing, a slew of enzymes are released from inception starting with salivary amylase and salivary lipase in the mouth to pepsin in the stomach. When the cake reaches the stomach (if the body doesn’t tell the sympathetic nervous system to throw up) it will mostly stay in the stomach while HCL and peristalsis do their thing to break down the food as much as possible, meanwhile, the stomach will push the cake through the small intestine in as quick as fashion as possible. Here, the small intestine, pancreas, gallbladder, and liver go into overdrive sending digestive enzymes to break down the food enough to be absorbed by the cell walls and into the blood and lymph systems.  Meanwhile, the CNS sends out “rest and digest” signals to the whole body including the pancreas which starts to make plenty of insulin for the bloodstream. These signals also attempt to slow down other normal activity in the body, in the hope that the body can more quickly digest this massive energy source. From here until the cake is digested, the body will attempt to store all of the fatty acids and carbohydrates as fat in the fat cells, the insulin levels will stay high until the cake is nearly out of the intestine. \n\n\nOn the other hand, when you eat only 1 piece of cake, the insulin levels will not stay as high for as long, which will make your body less lethargic allowing you to stay at an increased metabolic rate and using more calories overall. \n\n\nTL;DR Eating a whole cake causes more adipose tissue production thus leading to higher amount/ larger fat cells. \n"

                "Well, depending on your definition of 'worshiping the sun', some still do.\n\nFor example, in Hinduism, the god Surya is the sun god and is an important deity in traditional Hindu astrology.  He is worshiped as the supreme deity by the Saura sect (_URL_1_) of Hindus - tough admittedly they're a smaller sect than other major Hindu sects.  The Smrata Hindu tradition (_URL_2_) also worships Surya as one of its five principle deities, along with Shiva, Vishnu, Devi, and Ganesha.\n\nIn Japanese Shinto, the sun goddess Amaterasu is an important goddess, considered the ancestor of the Yamato clan, and thus the ancestor of all the Japanese emperors.  Ise Jingu shrine (_URL_0_) is arguably the most important Japanese shrine, and is dedicated to this sun goddess.  Worship at this shrine has been a key part of Shinto for hundreds of years.\n\nOther major religions (Christianity, Judaism, Islam etc.) don't worship the sun because it's considered to be a part of God's creation, rather than God himself.  This began with the Torah, as in Genesis 1:14, God famously creates the sun and moon (called 'lights in the firmament of heaven' in the text).",
                "If I may ask another question (if not I might put it as a seperate thread): Why *did* the ancient Egyptians worship the sun to such an extent? It seems that every Egyptian deity who was considered head of the pantheon in any region or time took on aspects of a sun god.\n\nI mean, I can understand that Egyptians would worship the Nile (as they did), because it gives the country life. But sunshine/warmth is a thing of which there always was an abundance in Egypt. Why would you worship a thing of which there is so much that it actually becomes a danger (draughts, fire, heatstroke, etc.) I could get it if say the German tribes in the freezing north worshipped the sun, but why somebody who no doubt would have been better off with a bit less sun?"

                "There's enough material in this question for a good-sized thesis. I have attempted to distill it down into a few paragraphs. I've found several books I now need to buy in the process, which is always good. :)\n\nThe 15th and 16th Centuries featured slow, gradual change in agriculture in Europe. People who worked on the land were differentiated by wealth much more at the end of the 16th century than they were at the beginning of the 15th, mostly due to consolidation of farming land, but you'd be hard put to point at a particular year or even decade and say that things changed then. Agricultural output increased, but this was in large part due to new land - forest or fen cut back, and in the Netherlands, land reclaimed from the sea. There's also some claim that there was an increased tempo of change toward the end of the period, possibly even constituing a sort of mini-agricultural revolution from 1560 onward, although I'm not completely convinced. \n\nThe following is generalised almost to the point of uselessness, to be honest, but here goes anyway. A 50-acre farm would have been a fairly comfortably sized one - with the average yield-seed ratios of the era (which are absolutely awful by modern standards, hovering around 4:1), 20 acres, mostly under grain, was just about enough to sustain a family of 5 (and in most areas, these are the smallest farms for which records exist). In a good year, on good soil, that could rise as far as 8:1, but more likely 6:1. And in a bad year, well, you were lucky to get your seed back. There were several periods where a few bad years came together - the mid 1540s and the late 1590s were very notable for this, and localised famines were the immediate result. Inefficient markets and slow transport meant that importing food from unaffected areas wasn't really possible. Toward the end of the 15th century, though, market movements were improving, and particularly in England, wool was a good cash option, so there's a movement then from arable to pasture land.\n\nThe ideal on 50 acres would probably have been to have a mixed farm; a good area under grain, assorted livestock and a variety of other crops. However, geography can militate against this - if you have good, fertile loam, you're not going to turn it into pasture grazing land (although you might have meadows for hay), and if you have thin, scrubby soil over shale hills, you can't do anything *but* turn it into grazing lands. Forest, marsh, coastal areas, and the presence or absence of rivers also have lots of effects - while water can be diverted (and very often was, with millraces and all manner of artificial streams) to get it to animals, it can't be made to run uphill - no pumps. So if you were grazing sheep on dry-ish hills, they needed to be herded down to water every day, probably a couple of times. Forest gives you firewood, and also foraging for pigs, but is otherwise land you can't put to other uses, and through most of northern Europe in these periods, could be home to wolves and bears^(1).\n\nHowever, mixing it up as much as you could gave you a bit of bulwark against the famine years. Assuming an ability to do that: barley, oats, wheat and legumes were grown on almost any farm. Rye was less frequent in the southern end of Europe, and more so in the northern end. Maslin, a period practice of growing different grains all mixed up in one field also happened (and that makes it quite hard to estimate yields). Onions, carrots and other roots, as well as brassicas, were the domain of kitchen gardens rather than full fields. \n\nThe fact that farms could be mixed didn't mean they were, though. Campbell and Overton (in the sources, below), point to a few farms in Norfolk that were 80% or more under barley for long periods - which can't have been great for the soil. And the other 20% would arguably have been fodderage and pasture for the horses (which were replacing oxen in all but the least progressive areas by the 14th century) necessary for ploughing for and transporting all that barley. \n\nIn terms of livestock, partly due to the cash value of wool, sheep moved from being a peasant stock to being a demesne stock - that is, they were kept directly by the owners of the bigger estates, rather than being owned by the peasants with wool passed on in rent. Pigs were everywhere - not in huge numbers, but everywhere. Cattle were more used for dairy than meat, but because of that, were nearly a necessity on any large farm - you need milk and butter and cheese. And chickens were probably pretty frequent too - capons (castrated roosters) on bigger farms, but mostly just everywhere and underfoot. They're not much accounted for in farming records, but they're there in recipes and other accounts. And in addition to the chickens, you have dovecotes, the introduction of rabbits to England around the 13th century as meat animals, semi-wild deer, and a wide assortment of other things. \n\nSo to give a vague conclusion before this gets completely out of hand, yes, late medieval/early modern farms were usually pretty mixed, but *could* be specialised. Specialisation probably happened more in otherwise wealthy areas like Norfolk, because people there weren't living on so much of a knife-edge of potential famine.\n\n**Sources:**\n\nSteve Hindle, 'Rural Society' in Beat Kumin, *The European World 1500-1800*, 2009.\n\nGrenville G.

There've been no bears in Ireland for 10,000 years, and wolves were never really a major concern up until they were hunted to extinction. So apart from mentioning they were there, I've no idea how much of a threat, socially or in reality, they really were. In either case, they were vastly, vastly more of a threat to livestock than people."

                " >  I squeeze the trigger which provides this energy for the bullet.\n\nHere's your problem.  Pulling the trigger isn't what provides the energy to the bullet.  The energy for the bullet comes from the explosive powder stored in the cartridge.  When this explosive is set off, the bullet flies forward.  \n\nThink of a gun's trigger like the gas pedal on your car.  The energy to make the car go forward doesn't come from your foot on the pedal.  It comes from the gasoline.  Your foot on the pedal just regulates the flow of gasoline into the engine.",
                "In most guns, pulling the trigger does not provide the energy to fire the bullet. When you load the first round in most guns except revolvers, the process of manipulating the action (the slide in handguns) compresses a spring.\n\nIn revolvers, pulling the hammer back will compress that spring. Some revolvers can also do this with a much heavier trigger pull.\n\nBy pulling the trigger, it releases the spring, which pushes a firing pin into the primer of the cartridge. (In a gun with a hammer, the spring pushes either the hammer directly into the primer or into a firing pin.) The primer explodes, igniting the gunpowder and propelling the bullet.\n\nIn automatic or semi-automatic guns, the explosion also cycles the action, loads the next round in and compressed the spring. Automatics will then let the spring decompress, repeating the firing process as long as the trigger is depressed. Semi-automatic guns require you to release the trigger and pull it again to fire the next round.",

The bullet goes bang, pushes back on the bolt (part that holds the bullet in place) bolt goes backward from recoil.  That motion is cocking the hammer back and loading the next bullet, and ejecting the casing of the just-fired bullet. \n\nSome more modern semi-auto and full-auto guns use some of the pressurized gas (same gas that is sending the bullet down the barrel) to drive the bolt backward.

When you squeeze the trigger it ignites the gun powder which propels the bullet forward. Think about how much energy is imparted with the flick of your finger. Not nearly enough to send a bullet off at faster than the speed of sound.\n\nWith automatic weapons, some of that energy being released is captured to effectively \"pull the trigger\" on the next round.",

                "It may be easier to clue you into what's happening by considering one rifle, fired in two separate ways.\n\nConsider the M16 military rifle. For the purposes of this answer, we will consider semi-automatic and automatic modes only.\n\nIn semi-automatic fire, pulling the trigger moves a part called the [*disconnector,*](_URL_3_) moving a small tab on the disconnector away from a notch on the [*hammer.*](_URL_1_) The hammer, under spring tension, flies up and strikes the *firing pin,* setting off the round. The force of the expanding gas drives the working parts of the rifle (the BCG, or [*bolt carrier group*](_URL_0_)) backward, forcing the hammer down. On its way down, it catches on that hook on the top of the disconnector, stopping it from firing again without releasing the trigger and pulling it again.\n\nIn full-auto mode, rotating the selector switch pushes the disconnector down so that the hook no longer catches the hammer. This time, a tab of metal called an *auto sear* sits behind the hammer. When the trigger is pulled, the hammer flies up and the BCG is forced backward, instead of being caught by the hook, the auto sear tips forward, catching part of the hammer. *But,* when the rear end of the BCG hits the auto sear, it knocks it off of the hammer. Under spring tension, the hammer flies forward again.\n\n[This video shows you in graphic form what I've described above.](_URL_2_)\n",
                "There are multiple systems where a portion of the gas or kinetic energy from the burning powder or expanding cartridge gets cycled back into the action. Here are a few examples:\n\nGas Direct Impingement: AR15\n\n* Hot gas made by the burning powder pushes the bullet out. There's a hole in the barrel that vents out a tiny bit of this gas and cycles it back to the gun. At the end of the bolt (the thing that locks to hold the cartridge) is a small cup that gets pushed, acting like a piston and causing the gun to unlock and cycle. This system puts dirty hot gas back into the gun.\n\nIndirect Gas/ Piston: AK47\n\n* Starting the same way as above, the gas pushes the bullet out, some of it is vented from a hole in the barrel into a chamber that has a piston. The gas pushes the piston, which is connected to the bolt. Causing it to unlock and cycle. This system vents the dirty hot gas outside of the gun, making the insides of the gun slightly cleaner.\n\nBlowback: Pistols, some submachine guns. \n\n* This system works by using the cartridge as a piston. When the gun is fired, the bullet works like a seal in the barrel. The hot gasses are pushing forward and back. When the bullet is towards exit, the pressure spikes the highest and pushes back on the cartridge too. The cartridge pushes against the action cause it to unlock and cycle the next round. ",
                "\"No such thing as a stupid question,\" my old teacher would say.  And then he would turn to the rest of the class and say \"Does anybody else have a stupid question?\"\n\nWhen you shoot a bullet in a simple handgun, what happens is that pulling the trigger releases the spring-loaded hammer which hits a firing pin, which ignites the primer, which ignites the powder, which propels the bullet out the barrel towards something you hopefully wanted dead.  On a single action revolver, you have to manually pull the hammer back again which also rotates the cylinder to bring the next bullet into position (in some very rare old guns you have to manually rotate the cylinder as well).  On a double action revolver, you can do that or you can just pull the trigger which will pull the hammer back and rotate the cylinder for you, but this is a harder and longer pull and may affect your aim and rate of fire.  For advanced users, hold down the trigger and slap at the hammer (also called \"fanning\"), quickly pulling it back and rotating the cylinder, and since the trigger is already pulled the hammer falls back and fires the bullet as quickly as possible.\n\nFor an automatic gun, the gun uses the recoil of firing the bullet or the expanding gases to do the \"bring the next bullet into position and pull back the hammer\" part.  Essentially, the machine gun does the fanning part for you.  Powered by the bullets themselves, it will keep firing until you run out of ammo or the barrel gets too hot, which is actually a problem in combat situations.  In WWII, the British would fire unnecessary rounds to heat up their guns so they could heat water for tea.\n\nIt's worth noting that in larger machine guns, those with multiple barrels, they have outside sources of power to rotate said barrels into position.  Early gatling guns had manual cranks.  Newer ones have electrical motors and have a spin up and spin down time during which they can't be fired.  My favorite machine gun is the [General Electric GAU-8/A Avenger](_URL_0_) which also has an A-10 Thunderbolt II \"Warthog\" airplane built around it.",
                "You provide energy to move the hammer for the first bullet. All other bullets are using the energy of the previous bullets discharge to reset the hammer and since you are holing the trigger down it does not lock in a cocked position and instead strikes the next bullet. ",
                "From the gunpowder. \n\nAutomatics are generally either recoil operated or gas operated, but the energy all comes from the gunpowder.",
                " >  I mean, if I think of a simple handgun, I squeeze the trigger which provides this energy for the bullet. But in automatic machine guns there is no such source, right?\n\nActually there is. \n\nThe shiny part you can see in [this image](_URL_0_) (showing the inner working of a SG-550 (standard military weapon in Switzerland) is the hammer. When you load a bullet into the chamber the hammer is automatically cocked and when you pull the trigger you release it. \n\nThe hammer then hits a sort of bolt (I don't know the exact English terms) and this bolt is then rammed into the primer of the cartridge. The primer explodes and ignites the \"larger\" load of \"gunpowder\" which expands abruptly and pushes the bullet out of the rifle. \n\nDuring the firing process part of the energy created is used to reload and during the reload process the hammer gets cocked again. \n\nThe only difference between automatic fire and semi-automatic fire is that the hammer isn't immediately released again after being cocked. \n\nSqueezing the trigger doesn't provide the energy for the bullet. It only sets of the process that will fire the bullet. "

                "Not an answer but blue is the shortest wavelength and therefore the highest energy of the visible spectrum. And higher energy is harder all around to deal with. For example, 7,000 kelvin light bulbs emit a lot of blue spectrum and many people find them to be burning and fatiguing of their vision. Another example is radio engineering, where higher frequencies are orders of magnitude more difficult to design and have increasingly erratic behavior. So it is built in to the wavelength/frequency of the light wave and the amount of energy required to generate it.",
                "Blue LEDs came along after red, yellow and green, but today white LEDs use a blue LED plus phosphors to make red and green. So production of blue LEDs is commonplace if not exactly \"easy\". \n\nDeep blue fireworks are difficult because the burning copper compounds don't emit only blue. They emit blackbody radiation as well because of their heat. That makes for a less saturated blue. The temperature is critical. Too hot means more washed out. Too cool means less blue to start with. A similar effect happens when things are heated to incandescence. At first you see deep red, then orange, yellow, and white. The red doesn't go away as other wavelengths are added. You don't see an overall green or blue hue even though both wavelengths are present in a white hot object.\n\nIs blue paint or dye difficult to make? I know blue is less common in nature than red, yellow, or brown, but green is also uncommon in animals. Many bright green snakes and frogs are actually blue and yellow. The blue comes from interference, the yellow from pigment. When they die, they sometimes turn blue as the yellow pigment fades away. ",
                "It all comes down to energy. \n\nFor emission, blue light has the highest energy, so to emit it you need to have two states that are pretty far apart in energy that are set up for electrons to transition efficiently between them. Generally, the wider the energy gap between two states, the higher the chance there are other states in between (due to defects, etc.) that electrons would more efficiently hop to (usually non-radiatively), thus quenching the emission.\n\nFor pigments, the problem is the opposite. To appear blue you need to absorb red and green. This requires have a very low-energy transition that red light can excite *without* having a higher-energy one that blue light can. This can be a challenge too, since many extended materials that absorb red and green light (like Si in solar cells) also absorb blue to some extent and just end up looking black. \n\nThree of the main ways to achieve this are to use a transition metal ion with a d-d transition in the red (usually Cu or Co), to use a near-IR absorption that tails into the visible, or to use an extended molecular structure to narrow the gap between ground and excited states. The first approach is how most ancient blue pigments like [Cobalt Blue](_URL_1_) and [Azurite](_URL_2_). The second mechanism is how [Prussian Blue](_URL_5_), [Ultramarine](_URL_3_), and [molybdenum blues](_URL_0_) work - a very easy  (read: low-energy) \"intervalence charge transfer\" where an electron hops between to atoms of the same element in different oxidation states. The last is a more modern approach, where extended pi-conjugated molecules like [copper phthalocyanine](_URL_6_) or [indigo](_URL_4_) are used; many of these organic molecules tend to be less stable to oxygen and UV light."

        "selftext": "My name is Ken Kosik. I’m a neuroscientist and neurologist at University of California, Santa Barbara. I'm fascinated by nearly every facet of Alzheimer’s disease and other cognitive disorders. I tend to think about the nervous system in terms of genetics and cellular and molecular biology, but also find the clinical questions compelling. AMA!\n \nThe incidence of Alzheimer’s disease is spiraling upward. By age 85 the likelihood of getting the disease approaches 50%, a grim reward for the octogenarian. Few diseases are as simultaneously cruel and mysterious as Alzheimer’s for its ability to obliterate a lifetime of memories and destroy histories even as it robs the person of his or her capacity to function in the present. And because we use memory to envision the future, Alzheimer’s disease also takes away expectations, anticipation, and hope.\n \nNearly 25 years ago, on a trip to Colombia, Dr. Francisco Lopera introduced me a family he had been tracking for the previous decade. We began a collaboration to find the cause of their early onset dementia, which turned out to be Alzheimer’s disease, and to identify the mutation responsible for the autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. The mutation turned out to be the substitution of glutamic acid for an alanine at position 280 of the presenilin I gene. The large extended family that harbors this mutation consists of about 5000 people whose lineage can be traced to a single founder, probably a conquistador who came from Spain not long after Christopher Columbus. Those family members who harbor the mutation are genetically determined to get a particularly aggressive early onset form of Alzheimer’s disease with the first symptoms apparent by age 45. The hallmark amyloid begins to collect in the brain about a decade earlier. Recently, this large Colombian family has begun to participate in a clinical trial that is testing an antibody directed at amyloid in the hope that the drug can reduce the amyloid burden and retard disease progression.\n \nThis story and others related to Alzheimer clinical trials is the subject of a NOVA PBS documentary titled “Can Alzheimer’s Be Stopped?” produced by Sarah Holt. I hope you will be able to watch it on the evening of April 13 at 9/8c on PBS: _URL_0_\n\nBy the way, this is AMA so please feel free to ask me about my other research interests, which include brain evolution and a research project on how the earliest cells during human development become neurons.\n\nThanks again for all your questions. I will continue to answer questions when I can this week, so stay tuned.",

Indeed, over 95% of *all* AD clincial trials have failed.\n\nThis trend (and other observations, such as the observation that even healthy individuals have Aβ oligomers) has prompted researcher to propose new hypotheses about the patho-etiology of AD. Of these, one hypothesis suggests that dysfunctional Presenilin (the gene which is mutated in these Colombian families) may be the key driver of AD.\n\nHow do you feel about this hypothesis?

It was a difficult decline, to say the least, causing health declines for us caregivers as well. I have two questions:\n\n1) Each of them ended up with different extreme behavioral issues - one with unmanageable OCD and anxiety, one with wild paranoid hallucinations and panic attacks, and one with frontal lobe dysfunction causing hypersexuality and a total lack of inhibition. Does Alzheimer's affect each person's brain differently, causing damage to different parts that cause such different behaviors? Or did each of them have these latent tendencies already, with Alzheimer's being the catalyst that brought them out?\n\n2) Is there quality research going on regarding the health declines of caregivers, and ways to mitigate and treat this? I've seen sleep deprivation, potentially stress-induced high cholesterol and blood pressure, severe depression, and cognitive decline in their spouses. Support groups help some with the tears, but trying to get medical help (and insurance coverage for it!) is difficult, as many primary care doctors and insurance companies don't seem to see caregiver burnout as a comprehensive medical condition.",

From what I know now, all of those were normal readings.  \n \nLast week we had to take her to the ER because of an irregular heart beat. This happened directly after a physical therapy session. The ER wanted to admit her and potentially put in a pacemaker but due to her illness and her DNR we opted to do a follow up appointment instead.

The Lipizzaners and other baroque breeds are also [trained in even more traditional moves](_URL_0_), which include jumping so as to get above/on top of foot soldiers, rearing up on their hind legs and striking out with their front, or jumping and kicking out their back legs. Horses are extremely trainable animals and love to please handlers whom they have grown to respect; it's presumably possible that an intelligent horse person could have trained their war horse to do any number of offensive moves while on the battlefield, though some were more standard than others. \n\nHaving been a horse person for decades, I feel compelled to include the disclaimer that horses are not by nature aggressive animals (quite the opposite). The only horses I have ever met that are truly aggressive towards humans by their own volition (and not while being asked to do that by a handler/rider) have been abused by humans in their past or are currently in a lot of pain (i.e. suffering from ulcers). Some ponies (horses under 14.2 hands tall, a hand is 4 inches) and some mares (unspayed female horses) may have an attitude that appears as aggressiveness to a non-horse person. They are, however, big prey animals and can be startled easily if not handled appropriately (and sometimes even if they are) or view behavior as a threat which often leads to being kicked or pushed over and injured unintentionally. They exist on a fight or flight plane -- loud noises, sudden movements, anything perceived as a threat or possible predator must be escaped. If it cannot be run from, they will fight it.",
                "Could a horse disembowel a man? Maybe, but I doubt it. Horses don't have the right tools to remove a man's intestines or to cut him open. A horse's teeth just aren't set up for that kind of thing (being herbivores and all). And while a kick from a horse can kill you, your intestines will likely stay within your body.\n\nI've found little evidence or reason to suggest that horses were trained to kick or attack at will on the battle field. In fact, that would be a really undesirable trait for a warhorse. It would make the horse absolutely impossible to handle. There's no way around that one- if the horse is trained to attack people and other horses, it will attack people and other horses, and it won't differentiate between its handlers and its enemies, especially in a combat scenario. It would not behove a knight to have his prize horse constantly attempt to kill the squire tasked with leading it to the battlefield, nor would it be good to allow the horse to attack men randomly. Knights, by and large, wanted horses that were obedient. \n\nIn his 1853 book, \"The Horse,\" William Youatt says that, \"the after-usefulness of the animal is founded, is early attachment to and confidence in man, and obedience, resulting principally from these\" (99).\n\nI've seen the claim that horses would bite and kick in combat in a fair amount of secondary and tertiary sources, but I'm yet to find a primary source that describes this actually happening. If it did happen, I'd imagine that it was probably unintentional and not something that the knight would train into his mounts. Because again, it would make handling the horse and stabling the horse an absolute nightmare (pardon a pun). If the knights were to charge, they would be doing so in a group. Why would the knights want their horses attacking other horses in their formation? Because that's what would happen.\n\nHere is a 17th century painting of Polish warhorses.\n\n_URL_0_\n\nNotice how they are in a tight formation, not attacking each other. This is the more typical warhorse.\n\nAnd beyond that... a horse's teeth aren't going to break armor. If a horse rears to strike, that puts the knight at a huge disadvantage because suddenly, all of his weight gets thrown back and he can't reach with his sword or lance. It exposes the horse's legs and stomach, which wouldn't have been armored, and on bad footing, it sets the horse up for a fall. If the horse kicks with its hind legs, that means the knight is facing away from the threat, which again, puts him at a disadvantage because he can't turn in his armor well while in the saddle, and he can't use his weapons. If his back is to the enemy, he would either be turning or running. Additionally, cavalry serve to break infantry lines and harass the enemy. The advantage of the horse is that they are mobile. If the horse is kicking, rearing, or biting, the horse is no longer mobile- it's stationary. And if the horse isn't moving, it's a much easier target to hit.\n\nAnyway. So I don't believe in the whole \"war horses would kick and bite!\" myth. I just can't find sources that prove it, and I can't find any logic that would make it make any sort of sense.\n\nHorses are inherently dangerous, but not so dangerous that they are unable to be handled safely. Horses were ultimately a way of getting a weapon to the battlefield, and they had to be obedient enough to do so reliably. And there is no horse training in history that would allow for a horse to bite a man on it's on volition. That has universally been considered a vice that needs correcting.\n\nIf that groom was killed, he probably did something he shouldn't have done around the horse.",
                "You may find interesting [this medical journal entry from 1896](_URL_0_) describing injuries from horse-kicks. \"No class of traumata produce such a variety of injuries and in such varying degrees as a kick of a horse upon the abdomen.\"",
                "On a related note, one of the most famous statistical distributions, the Poisson distribution, was popularized through a statistician's effort to estimate the total deaths by horse-kick in the Prussian army. So it was obviously a significant enough problem to warrant a large statistical study looking into it."

In a lot of ways the marketing techniques used with the (economically) lower and middle classes simply don't work with the upper class. To improve sales they develop a relationship with their potential customers, offer options for their vehicles based on the needs that their clients express to them, and make appearances (both with their representatives and their vehicles) at events that are more likely to have their clientele in the first place.

It might be that whatever causes Parkinson's *also* causes the damage to dopamine receptors. \n\nAlso, depression is linked to serotonin and norepinephrine, not dopamine. If anything, there'd be a lack of *motivation*, not depression. ",
                "There are 3 main pathways for dopamine in the brain. The nigrostriatal path is responsible for movement and that's the part that is compromised most with Parkinson's. You also have the mesolimbic, which is the \"reward\" center pathway, and mesocortical, which is more involved with emotional modulation. People with Parkinson's have degeneration of the cells that manufacture dopamine, so all of these pathways can potentially be affected, but for some reason the movement is most compromised.",

Researchers hypothesize that the effect of Parkinson's on this system is responsible for the clinical symptoms of depression and anxiety.\n\n[Source](_URL_0_)\n\nFor those living with Parkinson's, and family  &  friends, do stop over at /r/Parkinsons.

                "There seems to be a little confusion/questioning about what you're left with after the water step, fibrinogen or albumin so I looked up the blood contents\n\nConveniently there is this image at wikipedia, which is pretty fascinating:\n\n_URL_0_\n\nAll the way to the right you can see the things present in the grams per litre range\n\n    Albumin 40-50 g/L\n    Globulins 25-35 g/L\n    Fibrinogen 2-2.5 g/L\n    Transferin 2-3 g/L\n\nInterestingly these are all \"big\" things in that they are all proteins with fairly high molecular masses. Just about everything else in your blood ( <  1 g/L) is a small molecule. There are some exceptions (proteins with names ending in '-in') but they are vanishingly rare and not worth considering here.\n\nSo what happens with your mildly gruesome process/experiment? The blood in your bottle cap will undergo 2 processes that \"dry\" it off, some of the water will evaporate off and the prothrombin/thrombin will get on with coagulating your blood.\n\nThrombin converts the fibrinogen (soluble) in your blood to fibrin (insoluble). The fibrin can bond to itself and will form a loose sticky mesh. This mesh forms the main structural matrix of a blood clot or scab. Embedded in this meshed will be any large items in your blood; blood cells (red  &  white) and proteins.\n\nWhite blood cells and most proteins are pretty rare so the mesh will mostly contain red blood cells, albumin, globulin and transferrin.\n\nYour next step is to move the coagulated disc to water. It is not completely clear to me what happens at this step. Certainly all the haemoglobin (the red stuff) leeches out of the disc and back in to the water due to the osmotic gradient. There seems to me to be two processes this could happen.\n\nFirst, the fibrin mesh is sufficiently loose so the red blood cells just dissolve back to the water. Red blood cells are pretty big, if this is the case then you'd also expect all other trapped water soluble elements (proteins, small molecules) to also return to the water. This means your remaining slimy material is almost certainly just the remaining Fibrin mesh with nothing else\n\nAlternatively the water you've added may lyse (break open) the red blood cells, due to the osmotic pressure. In this case the haemoglobin will dissolve back in to the water but leave the detritus of the red blood cells trapped in the fribin matrix. Albumin and haemoglobulin are all around the same molecular weight (approx 60KDa), so if the haemoglobulin can dissolve back to the water then so can most of the other blood proteins. In this case the slimy material left is the fibrin mesh with the remains of the red blood cells trapped in it. Globulins can range up to 1000s of KDa so perhaps they might remain trapped in the mesh too.\n\nEdit: As pointed out below overnight drying may just rupture all the redblood cells. I don't know whether the fibrin network will trap enough water to prevent this. So perhaps the latter outcome is most likely"

                "Bones usually have 2 main fascial compartments around them. A flexor and extensor, and some have a medial compartment too. There is no real need for a strong dorsiflexion action in the lower leg (bending your foot upwards), the muscles are used mainly for stabilization and so there are no large muscle groups there. Compare that to the other side of the leg where a strong plantarflexion (pushing your foot donwards) action is needed for walking and you have the huge calf muscles.\n\nedit: mixed up extensor and flexor in the leg again",
                "Other answers address why there is less muscle mass on the anterior side of the leg, but don't answer the question of why the tibia is exposed.  I don't think k there is a really good answer... Probably coincidence as much as anything, but consider this:\n\nThe arm and leg are actually built very similarly, and the forearm has two bones (ulna  & amp; radius) just like the leg does (tibia  & amp; fibula).  The ulna is the arm-version of the tibia, and if you feel your own arm, you can trace the unprotected bone all the way from the elbow to the wrist just below the pinky finger.  In my opinion, the only difference between the ulna and tibia is that the tibia has to bear all your body weight, so it is a much larger bone, and thus your shin is a lot more prominent than your exposed ulna.\n\nTo answer your second question: why do we have no protection from bumping our shins?:\n\nThe tibia IS the protection.  Bone protects soft tissue from injury, ie. the skull protects the brain, sternum and ribs protect heart, vertebrae protect the spinal cord.\n\nEdit: I don't really think the point of the tibia is protection.  It is there to support the body and anchor muscles  &  ligaments.  Just saying that while many muscles 'cushion' bones from impact, that's not really their purpose, and you wouldn't grow a muscle on the front of your shin just to keep from bumping it.\n",
                "If comparing the amount of tissue on the anterior portion of the tibia, then any benefit of additional tissue to protect the shin from damage would be outweighed by the detriment of increasing mass in the legs resulting in decreased running speed, manoeuvrability, and endurance.\n\nIf comparing the position of the tibia relative to the centre of the leg (keeping the mass of tissue the same but changing the anterior-posterior location of the tibia), then having a more anteriorly located tibia would allow a greater lever action from the calf muscles to lift the body during [toe-off](_URL_0_) of the gait cycle.\n\nOverall the driving force to protect the shin would be outweighed by the driving force to run faster and for longer (think minor injuries when it is impacted which can heal vs. ability to outrun predator or prey). So evolution optimized for the most anteriorly positioned tibia that had just enough tissue on the anterior side to still allow sufficient enough blood flow.",
                "The muscles don't really serve as bone protectors. Muscles are for motility. This fact is demostrated by the many bones in your body that have no mucle between them and the skin. Skull, sternum, vertebrae etc. Even the back side of your ulna has nothing between it and the skin just like the tibia in the same respective area."

A cat on a branch that won't come down just doesn't feel like coming down and would like you to bugger off to let him do his own thing for a while.\n\nEdit: Well, ok, I guess I'm thinking of full grown, outdoor cats. Really young cats, or cats who have been indoors their entire lives, can get a little creeped out, actually. They get too high up and get scared. They'll figure it out eventually if you give them a chance, though.",
                "You can, and you can't. On the one hand, it will probably figure out how to get down again, and be fine, depending on how smart/old/agile it is. On the other hand, it might take a while which means it'll be crying in the tree for a while, which gets annoying at the very least. Depending on the weather, you may not be able to let said cat just figure things out. You also run the risk of it jumping or falling from too high of a height, which could lead to injury.\n\nMy recommendation is to stay with it for a bit, see if it can figure out how to come down - but if it's not making progress, if it's cold out, or if it looks like the cat wants to try jumping, etc, give the cat a hand.

Almost all animals have a very strong desire to do everything moving head first. That is why a cat doesn't climb down the same way they climbed up. My best guess is that when the cat gets thirsty enough it will try and jump down. Might be successful, might not.",
                "  The saying is one never sees cat skeletons in trees so they will eventually risk coming down on their own, still it reminds me of an event that did amaze me.\n\n Near 30 years ago, I rented a 2nd floor apartment with a large tree outside the window. Came home from work, it was starting to rain and I heard a cat crying in the tree. I climbed it a short distance but the silly cat then climbed higher The rain was getting worse so I said 'FU, cat' and went upstairs. A friend cane by with some good weed so we got stoned and watched the lightning. It turned into a pretty nasty storm, waves of rain. and the cat was howling in full view from the window- but beyond reach.\n\n Perhaps God lent a hand, hard to say, but a bolt NAILED that tree. It was now dark out but in that flash I saw the cat blown clear. As my friend hollered 'Praise the Lord' (the thunder was deafening/ rocked the house) I witnessed it tumbling through the air. Cat was nowhere to be found, so it apparently survived.",
                "So we had some stupid cat get stuck in a big pine tree we have in the back yard. Probably climbed the tree to get away from our two dogs. On the first day, we figured we'd leave it overnight and it would find a way down. By the end of the second day it hadn't moved and was up there crying.\n\nEventually, I was able to use a tennis ball tied to a string to run a line over a branch above the cat. Had to use a tennis racquet to hit the ball high enough because the stupid cat was like 30 feet up. I then tied a basket onto the line with a can of tuna in there. Once I got it close enough, the smell of the tuna must have really worked 'cause the cat jumped right into the basket and I lowered it down to safety.\n\nSo, to answer the question, I think they can get stuck in trees. Especially with dogs patrolling the bottom of said tree.",
                "Why can't you just get a hose?",
                "We had a cat that treed itself for more than 4 weeks in January and February in NY.  It was too stupid to climb down, and every time we tried to put a ladder up to get it down it got scared and climbed higher.  It went through snow and ice storms and still stayed in the tree.  Every time we called a vet to see what we should do they said, \"don't worry, it'll come down.  Try luring it down with food\".  So my mom hung cans of tuna in the tree and grilled steak under the tree for the whole month, but she wouldn't come down.  She was about 40 feet up by the end of it in a very thin tree.  Because of the location on the property we couldn't get a cherry picker up there either, so after more than a month we cut the tree down.  As we were lowering it, the fucker jumped out of the tree still 30 feet off the ground and ran away for 2 days.  When she finally came home she was just skin and bones and was never the same again.",

                "This past summer, our cat went missing. He'd been gone overnight before, so we weren't worried.  After two days we put up signs and started to get calls about a lot of cats that weren't ours. After five days we started to give up hope. By chance, a guy outside of our neighborhood did see a sign after a week. Our cat had been stuck in his tree for 6 days.  It was up about 40 feet.  We ended finding a local guy who is a (professional?) tree climber.  He went up and after 30 minutes, was able to grab him, stuff him in our provided pillow case and lower him down by rope.  Here's a photo that the guy took right before he got him: _URL_0_\n\nI'm not sure he was every going to come down.  It was in the 90s that week and he had gone 6 days without water except for one night of rain. ",
                "I had a cat be stuck in a huge, huge tree for about four days when I was a kid of around 7. My dad told me not to worry because \"You don't find cat skeletons in trees\" and I said, \"That's because the wind knocks them down\". To this day I am still pretty sure my theory works over his.",
                "Cat's claws are curved in such a way that they work for climbing up but not for going down, so they basically have no traction going down. If they're not too high up, they'll just jump down, but if they're very high up, they may be facing a dead-if-you-do, dead-if-you-don't situation.\n\nWhen I was a teen, a neighbor's cat got stuck about 100 feet up a very tall tree. The next day, the fire department showed up and got it down. A few months later, it happened again. Each day when I went outside, I heard the cat meowing for help. On the third day, I asked, and they said the fire department refused to come again.\n\nI went home, put on some tight gloves and a jacket. I got a belt and tied it around the bottom of the jacket. I carefully climbed the tree. When I got to the level of the cat, he immediately came over to me and clung to me. I put him in my jacket and zipped it up. He was very calm, seemingly relieved.\n\nThe little boy who lived there had come out to watch. When I got down, I handed him the cat. From that day forward, every time he saw me, he would say, \"You saved my cat!\" or something similar. I never imagined it would mean so much to him, nor the way it would make me feel every time he said that. I just wanted to help the cat.",
                "Wow, not a single inside-cat owner explaining this?  \n\nBasically, once your inside cat makes it outdoors, you're slightly terrified that you'll lose them permanently.  Cats don't always return home like dogs tend to do - you have a spooked inside-only kitty outside and you may well never see it again.\n\nIf they spook and run up a tree, well... the issue is in trying to get them down NOW so you can control the recapture, or at least continue following it until it calms and can be retrieved to the house.  \n\nYou certainly could leave it to get bored/tired/hungry and figure out how to make it down, but then you're effectively abandoning your cat.  Odds of ever seeing it again go way down.  \n\nThis whole concept only really applies to indoor cats that are pretty unfamiliar with outside/trees.  Outdoor or hybrid in/out cats are pretty comfortable in an arboreal state.",
                "Cats can survive falling at their terminal velocity (the highest speed they will reach when falling), this is why they can and do jump out of many story buildings and survive.  \n\nThough like anyone else jumping from heights it's not really a smart move as there are a lot of ways they can seriously injure themselves.  \n\nCats will usually get desperate and jump if they have to.  But they do the distressed wailing first because they know you'll try and help them and it's usually much easier to help than to pay vet bills for broken bones.  "

                "A good question. Though I have no credible sources, I would imagine its as simple as this:\nUSA, Russia, and China all have small pox locked away for a few reasons. First, though no current humans knowingly have it, the virus could be hiding or laying dormant elsewhere. Animals such as bats and vermin are known carriers for some pretty scary stuff like ebolai. So its technically possible for the disease to make a come back. \n\nSecondly, if any of us were at war with each other, the temptation to use it as a weapon is going to be pretty high. Sure, the Geneva Convention outlawed biological warfare,  but in an all out third world war, nothing will be off the table. We keep the virus so in case they try to infect our population, we can create vaccines to counter it. \n\nThere may be some more points such as medical applications of altering the diseases,  but the above reasons are my speculation as to why we still have them. ",
                "ELI5 answer: we can never be 100% sure that someone else has not kept a deadly virus in a lab. Therefore the risk of it being used as a weapon in the future will always exist, even though it might be small. So it makes sense for us to keep a version of the virus to use in case we need to engineer a treatment in the future. ",
                "they are kept in case some country or terrorist group has an unregistered secret culture (a viable or dormant preserved form of the disease) that they may use for biological warfare. If, say, smallpox was released to the public in a terrorist act, everyone born after the 1970s when they stopped vaccinating would be susceptible to the disease. The idea behind keeping cultures of these diseases is to allow the quick and workable design of a new vaccine for a hyper-mutated weaponised strain in the event of attack, to eliminate loss of life. However the debate behind keeping these cultures is rife and the potential risks may outweigh the benefit. Basically, they should probably just cook the cultures and be done with it but we can't be sure that someone isn't harbouring the disease in some secret place.",
                "This was [discussed on NPR](_URL_0_) on Friday, specifically about smallpox, which is the only disease to have been completely wiped off the planet except for lab samples. For smallpox, there is an actual debate about destroying it completely instead of risking it being released again in the future.\n\nI'm pretty sure the rest of them pop up here and there, even if they're mostly eliminated. So it's worth keeping them around to study.",
                "A lot of them are kept as an index to compare generic structure of new outbreaks to old ones as well as to identify specific strains. ",
                "A lot of people have answered the first question, for your second question: It's not a movie. Breaking a vile on the ground isn't going to release a massive wave of disease wind into a conveniently open air duct leading to it spreading throughout the building. These are super secure buildings, with well trained staff, made specifically for housing these bugs and preventing the spread outside of its walls. ",
                "Eliminated doesn't mean no longer exists.\n\nFor example, they recently found smallpox scabs in an envelop that dated to the Civil War, which contained the active virus.  Keeping the virus around allows scientists to because to combat it should an outbreak occur.\n\nAdd to the fact that multiple countries are doing this, and some countries might choose to use it was a weapon, there is a value in keeping it around."

                "Its more a case of how safely newer cars can run on the edge of knock. Unlike older cars, your new car has an amazing computer that can read all sorts of sensors to determine how to run with the ~87 octane you're putting in it. \n\nFirst off its important to know what octane is. In the past it was a measure of certain molecules in the fuel, now its a measurement of how resistant a fuel is to ignition in light of heat and pressure. Low octane is thus less stable than high octane. It will ignite easier and less predictably.\n\nNext knock, its mostly referred to iginition in the cylinder at a bad time. Hot spots, pressure and heat can cause the ignition of fuel/air mixtures at really bad times, like when a cylinder (piston, oops!) is traveling up! This is nasty slam which can cause tons of damage over time to ring lands, bearings, etc. Also note that ignition is not instantaneous. It takes time and deals with the flame front from the spark to the piston head. So what you want to shoot for is igintion at spark with the flame front meeting the piston head at the downstoke. Preferrable when the connecting rod is at an angle where the vector of force is such that more force goes to rotating the crank than hammering the bearing.\n\nSo the name of the game is controlled ignition! \n\nKnock sensors detect when ignition goes bad and can retard timing to ensure future ignition at certain loads/rpm occur nicely. Intake temperature sensor can alter timing as well when it gets too hot outside. MAF / MAP sensors work in turbo cars to alter timing based on pressure added to the cylinders. \n\nIn short your new car is a robot with tons of sensors, algorithms and data tables that help it determine how to best run low octane fuel safely.\n\nEDIT: I have modified many turbo cars, helped reverse engineer automotive ROMs using IDA and have written my own software to edit ROM tables, log data, etc. My own last car was a turbo STi running 24 psi on 93 octane, and more PSI when I turned my meth injection kit on. \n\nEDIT #2: This is a snapshot of timing data a car would use. _URL_0_\n\nEDIT #3: When talking about timing values, you're talking about degrees of crank/rod angle before TDC (top dead center, or totally vertical connecting rod) Since ignition takes time, you spark before TDC and hope to god the flame front hits the piston head on the down stroke, after TDC.\n\nEDIT #4: Another thing to consider is fuel economy and AFR (air fuel ratio). There is a AFR point 14.7:1 *stoich* thats the optimum ratio for perfect combustion. The problem is that this makes for very unstable conditions in a high compression engine as leaner ratios can create very hot combustion. Against this is set of bad pollutants created at this lean ratio. All taken together its best to run at 12.5:1 to even better, low 13s:1. Once again, until recently with new materials and great car computers like those in the Impala, this just wasn't an option and you would have to run richer to cool the cylinder while wasting fuel.",
                "Many factors are involved in controlling \"ping\" or better described as pre ignition. \n\nOne of which is materials being used in the construction of the cylinder head/heads and block casting. A general rule of thumb, at least in the small block chevy world, is that aluminum heads will allow you to run 1 compression higher while all other variables are the same. Not always the case, but it explains the point superficially.\n\nAnother is cooling. A lot of work goes into the plumbing of the engine. Take for example the older chevy small block engines. The coolant system was fairly simple, but because of the way it was setup different parts of the engine would run at different temperatures because the coolant would get progressively warmer. Hotter parts cylinders will detonate faster. \n\nThen of course there is all of the computer controls which very finely calibrate how much fuel to add to help control/cool the cylinders.\n\nOthers will chime in with more specific things. But in general every little thing will play a role which adds up. Like quench, cam profile, cylinder ring gap, oil, etc.",
                "Also probably benefit of direct injection systems.  It injects the gas into the cylinder at the last possible moment, allowing the engine to better prevent pre-ignition knock\n\nSource\n_URL_0_",
                "To begin with, many of the other comments are highly relevant, but a better understanding of \"knock\" will fully answer your question. Knock occurs in any gasoline engine when ignition occurs before TDC and the combustion pressure front hits the piston combustion chamber face at a crank angle in which the vast majority of the load does not do useful work on the crank but simply overloads the wrist pin and crank bearings. The premature ignition timing creates much higher combustion chamber pressures and resonances that destroy valves, erode cylinders, heads and pistons, and break rings. The cause is simple and key to your answer: something in that chamber causes a spark (incorrect spark plug timing, burning/sparking components or intake charge), or gets hot enough to cause spontaneous combustion. To elaborate: A intake charge of fuel and air can be pre pressurized and heated by a turbo and then after being compressed be beyond autoignition temperature. Or a exhaust valve could be made of a material which retains heat (glowing hot) and the local mixture can therefore ignite due to contact (think simple physics, conduction, convection, and radiation).\nModern engines have active fuel management (computerized) that stops potential preignition mixtures during high load conditions (something a carb would not do) and also hot intake conditions (this is designed into the fuel map), they also employ sensors that detect knock and adjust intake mixtures accordingly (richen to decrease combustion chamber temperature).\nNow with that being said, high compression ratio engines have been built in the past that worked great. For example: the fireball combustion chamber has been run at up to 14:1:\n_URL_1_ \nand here: \n_URL_0_\n\nAs has been pointed out it is modern fuel management and spark timing, as well as better design of the cooling system within the block and head (thank computer aided design) and last but not least modern material choices that have allowed less expensive engine designs to running higher combustion chamber pressures and thus achieve higher efficiency. \n\nNote: All of this is simplified for the sake of a short response.\n\nSource: I have designed and manufactured heavy fuel, and spark ignition engines for prototype and production.\n",
                "tugi is correct in that combustion knock (ping etc...) is premature autoigntion of the fuel. There have been significant advances that have enabled regular (IMO low octane) fuels to be more widely utilized. The knock sensor alglorathim is part of that, but just as important are advance to the combustion chamber, scavenging, direct injection, in-cylinder fluid dynamics and EGR (exhaust gas recirculation).\n\nTechnically what you are noting as as knock is end gas knock, which is premature ignition of the peripheral charge late in the cycle. end gas knock is a function of time and temperature (and to some degree pressure).  This is commonly modeled with the livingwood-wu integral or [similar methods](_URL_0_). Temperature is primarily a function of compression ratio, however it is also a function of composition (ratio of specific hearts of the working fluid), initial temperature at intake valve close, and to some degree the combustion rate. \n\nWith a direct injected engine the fuel evaporates inside the cylinder, cooling the charge. This effectively increases the knock tolerance of the engine, as it decreases the final compressed charge temperature prior to spark and combustion. Moreover if the combustion chamber has good turbulence then the combustion rate increases decreasing the time that the end gas has to wait till the flame arrives. These two factors decreases the time temperature history and thereby reduce knocking propensity. \n\nAdditionally cooled EGR can be used to reduce the effects of compression heating (charge temperature prior to spark) by changing the specific heat of the charge (EGR has a high specific heat reducing charge heating and combustion temperatures).\n\nIn all likelihood the engine you drove does a bit of all of these. which are all aimed at increase fuel economy and power in a smaller displacement engine.\n\n\nEDIT! I can guarantee that GM or any other OEM has optimized the combustion rate and performance of a \"normal engine\" that is intended for 87AKI gasoline where the engine is not overly limited by knock at typical driving conditions, that would affect the vehicles ability to meet  corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) requirements. ",
                "Motorcycles can have mechanical compression ratios much higher (13:1 is common,) and still run on 87. With motorcycles, it's important to understand that the mechanical compression ratio is different than the effective compression ratio. The effective compression ratio is a combination of the mechanical ratio and the volumetric efficiency of the engine.\n\nAn engine spinning at 10,000RPM doesn't do a great job of filling the cylinders completely, so it has a relatively low Volumetric Efficiency. Because of this, the cylinder doesn't quite fill up completely, so the actual pressure in the cylinder isn't as high as you might expect.\n\nVolumetric Efficiency describes how well the engine is capable of filling the cylinders. A VE of 1.0 is considered very good. Some naturally aspirated engines can do better than 1.0, by taking advantage of the inertia of air to ram air into the cylinder. Turbo-charging is a technique that permits VE to go well above 1."

                "Have you ever watched *Game of Thrones*, or better yet, read the ASOIAF books? One thing that has always stuck out to me is the way Martin crafts a very strong family-centric identity and motivational pattern for the noble women characters. Obviously the motives of actual people are infinitely more complex and diverse than fictional characters. \n\nBut we might think of the picture he creates of Cat and Cersei in particular as *normative* or prescriptive for the late Middle Ages. That \"Family First\" mindset is our frame of reference for understanding the lives and duties of new patrician and noble mothers.\n\n\"First\" would first mean the new mother taking care of herself. For England, Barbara Harris describes a three-stage \"lying-in\" period that was expected (though again, actual practices would vary by case). First, the mother was *literally* lying, in her bed; after a period of two weeks or so, she was considered healed enough to sit upright; after another stretch of time, she could walk around but still only in the birthing/lying-in chamber. (Which she had prepared in advance to be special and awesome.) \n\nAll of this gave her body time to recover from the trauma of childbirth before resuming her regular household and court duties. And most particularly, before she was in the presence of men--especially her husband--again. (Incidentally, this is one reason that the \"wet nurses so she could get pregnant again ASAP\" thesis is just an excuse, NOT the whole story.)\n\nIdeally, the newborn would be removed from the mother almost immediately and given over to the care of nurses. The point was not at all to break the emotional ties between mother and child--in fact, mothers and fathers alike were expected to be intimately emotionally involved with their children. In Jewish families (stepping away from \"nobility or gentry\" for a moment), for example, mothers could not participate in the circumcision ceremony for their newborn sons but provided a special clean diaper cloth for the ceremony.\n\nInstead, the point was that any random woman could change a baby's diaper, any nursing woman could breastfeed an infant. Only the infant's mother could resume her duties at court and/or running the family and household, as swiftly as possible, thus doing far more to secure their long-term good fortune than dangling a rattle over a rocking cradle once a day.\n\nOnce women had returned to full participation in church and household, their Family First mentality pushed an expansion of their previous duties. Whether at court or traveling to visit family members and important acquaintances, mothers were to seek our potential marriage partners and wardship situations even while their offspring were toddlers. \n\nLater on in their children's lives, Christian mothers are often attributed with or charged with taking control of securing their children an education--in the high Middle Ages, some queen mothers are even credited with teaching their princeling sons to read--but for sure, didactic literature expects mothers to teach their children Christian morality by example and in the basics of Christian devotion (the standard prayers, the Ten Commandments,  & c).\n\nNow, it's important to remember yet again that this whole picture is normative. There is some evidence, especially from Germany, that suggests more flexibility for new mothers in how much attention they paid to day-to-day details of infant care. A very, *very* popular devotional practice in 14C-15C was what Rosemary Hale calls *imitatio Mariae*: imitation of Mary.\n\nThis meant envisioning yourself swaddling Jesus in his swaddling clothes, laying him in a manger, laying him in bed, decorating his swaddling clothes, breastfeeding him. Some women even had dedicated Christ-child dolls to LARP with, assuming \"LARP\" was a meditative practice that was, at its heart, a prayer. The devotion was documented and encouraged through \"Vitae Christi\" books, lives of Christ, that were enormously popular with religious women, especially in Germany.\n\nThe point is obviously not that aristocratic women role-played nursing Christ, so they were familiar with nursing their own/each others' infants. Rather, it shows how medieval people understood that the daily tasks of motherhood created an exuberant *emotional* bond between people and their rec center ( & c). \n\nIn some cases (Birgitta of Sweden, Katharina Tucher) we even witness aristocratic and/or wealthy mothers enacting the imitatio Mariae. They understood at an experiential level that what they were envisioning themselves doing with the Christ-child was, in fact, *mothering*."

They were hired on a contractor basis to run protection details for specific individuals, both in the private and public sector. The US Govt hired them to do certain tasks and cover dignitaries. And Haliburton/KBR (Dick Cheneys company) hired them to play machine gun bodyguards to cover the oil men. So the difference is they are specifically hired for protection, and not hired in a basis to actually instigate or start battles. Where as a true mercenary would be specifically hired to fight battles. \n\nThat is what the difference is \"supposed\" to be, and what Blackwater was \"supposed\" to do. (And a good majority of them did do).\n\nHowever, the reality of it though is a good portion of blackwater jumped through 1 legal fucking loophole after another... and they sure as shit were mercenaries. 4 \"Contractors\" are serving serious time while their \"boss\" hung them out to dry, and sold blackwater to a group of investors only to make millions. ",
                "Mercenaries are prohibited because they will fight for any side provided that they are paid enough. And therefore have no stake.\n\nContractors are hired by a specific country for security positions. They escort convoys, they help guard bases and offices and such, they are very heavily armed/trained security guards, officially. They don't actually conduct patrols, they don't go out and fight, they aren't meant to be used like soldiers.",
                "Mercenaries don't give a cut of their profits to the governments out to get them. When they do, they become contractors.",
                "Interesting. I did not realize that they were not technically Mercs.\n\nA distinction without a difference, in my view. ",
                "The geneva convention lays down a very specific definition of \"Mercenary\" making it easy for anything to escape that title. Lots of private military contractors provide support, training, protection, etc. so its difficult to to pin down a single definition of who and what they are. For a *really* good deep dive into this topic, check out \"The Modern Mercenary\". I'm about half way through, but really interesting stuff. ",

                "The difference is mercenaries are hired guns that are paid to do one thing (Fight an opposing force, asssasinate someone, etc.) and generally have no rules or protocols to follow in order to get that task accomplished. \n\nBlackwater (now known as Academi) and companies like them are contractors who work under a strict contract which details what they are supposed to do and how to do it. They are known to provide security for individuals, businesses, government buildings, bases, etc. They also might be hired to train soldiers and in some rare cases aid them in a mission/operation. This is where it gets choppy because since they aren't acting under military law and rules they can't be Court Marshaled or otherwise tried as part of the nations military, which sometimes allows them to use it as a loophole. This is certainly rare as most of them wouldn't do this because it would be a breach of contract and they wouldn't get paid but it does happen. \n\nI don't know if this was posted in light of the 4 former Blackwater members being tried recently for the massacre of Iraqi civilians, but I glad those murders are being sentenced finally.

                "how does one sign up for Blackwater?",
                "Alright, this is actually something that I can answer with an informed and well supported view. I'm currently studying for my Master's degree in international security and have studied private military. According to Peter Singer, author of *Corporate Warriors*, there are 6 essential characteristics that distinguish mercenaries from other combatants and military organisations:\n\n1. *Foreign:* \"A mercenary is not a citizen or resident of the state in which he or she is fighting\"\n\n2. *Independence:* \"A mercenary is not integrated (for the long term) into any national force and is bound only by the contractual ties of a limited employee\"\n\n3. *Motivation:* \"A mercenary fights for the individual short-term economic reward, not for political or religious goals\"\n\n4. *Recruitment:* \"Mercenaries are brought in by oblique and circuitous ways to avoid legal prosecution\"\n\n5. *Organisation:* \"Mercenary units are temporary and ad-hoc groupings of individual soldiers\"\n\n6. *Services:* \"Lacking prior organization, mercenaries focus on just combat service, for single clients\"\n\nTo counter these characteristics, there are 6 reasons why private military firms (PMFs) are different:  \n\n1. *Organisation:* \"Prior corporate structure\"\n\n2. *Motives:* \"Business profit-driven, rather than individual profit-driven\"\n\n3. *Open Market:* \"Legal, public entities\"\n\n4. *Services:* \"Wider range, varied clientele\"\n\n5. *Recruitment:* \"Public, specialised\"\n\n6. *Linkages:* \"Ties to corporate holdings and financial markets\"\n\nBasically, mercenaries are usually assembled on an ad-hoc basis and are in it for individual profit motives. Additionally, they generally only offer simple combat services, rather than the vast array of services that PMFs can provide. PMFs are corporations that hire personnel usually on contractual bases, and these persons can provide a wide range of services. \n\nToday, modern militaries rely heavily on private military firms to help them function. While firms like what was previously known as Blackwater provide services at the forefront of operations, there are other types of companies that provide consultancy and support and logistics. So while one PMF may provide a private security detail of a VIP, another firm could build military bases and installations, operate mess halls, service latrines, or control the supply chain. The operations of *military provider* PMFs certainly falls under a grey area of international law, but other types of PMFs may be more black and white than you'd expect. I hope this gives you a better understanding of the key differences between mercenaries and private military companies. ",
                "PMC's, or private military contractors, are supposed to be used defensively by definition. Mercenaries are defined as offensive, which makes them illegal, but the difference is hazy.",
                "ELI5:\nPrivate military contractors are contracted to provide services for non-inherent government functions (defensive, maintenance of infrastructure, logistics like fuel and water, etc.). Mercenaries are contracted to provide services that include inherent government functions. A government function in a battlefield can be considered the conducting of offensive tactical operations. \n\nA little more explanation:\n\n**Private Military Contractors** or PMCs for short such as Blackwater, DynCorp, Aegis, etc., are contracted to provide services for *non-inherent governmental functions*. Non-inherent governmental functions can be serving as an interpreter or providing certain supplies such as water or electrical maintenance for a military base. An inherently governmental function would be conducting offensive operations such as seeking out and eliminating insurgents. \n\n**Mercenaries** are on the other hand contracted to carry out *inherent governmental functions* such as conducting offensive operations. One example is where a company called Executive Outcomes _URL_0_, a Private Military Contractor from South Africa, operated in an offensive tactical role in Equatorial Guinea's 2004 coup d'etat.\n\nPMCs such as Blackwater are sometimes called (*PMC employees sometimes consider the reference mercenaries as a derogatory term*) mercenaries due to the grey areas that a battlefield can provide. Also questions as to how they chose to act within those circumstances have led to this term being leveled against them and the field as a whole. Within the diplomatic security contracts the contractors serve as security details. These contractors are detailed to protect clients (State Department foreign service and other VIPs) from hostile encounters. Example would be a client is driven to meet with some elders of a community and mortar fire is reported to be incoming. The contractors are alerted and the contractors extract the client to a safe location. \n\nThe role of the contractor in this example is to use all options to disengage and get the client to safety. However if they are tactically cornered or the client is pulled away from the detail, the contractors are to engage and attempt to recover the client and then get to safety. This can also lead to calling in any local military support if this occurs. How tactical situations arise and how choices are made to engage or disengage can result in an ambiguous grey area leading to questions about the roles of PMCs and how much their roles overlap the line between governmental functions and non governmental functions.\n\nSource:\nI worked within the Diplomatic Security / Private Military Contractor (PMCs) field (not Blackwater, but a competitor) for several years, mostly in efforts relating to deploying personnel to and from theater.  After leaving that line of work I subsequently studied the gov't policies revolving the High Threat Protection Diplomatic Contracts as part of my Masters Program, but I am by no means an expert in this! \n\nedit:Removed some bolding",
                "A lot of FUD here, to be expected from a pretty loaded question.  But to truly understand this, one has to understand the problem the Geneva convention was trying to solve.\n\nMercenaries saw wide use across Europe before the advent of professional volunteer armies, which really only saw their first use in medieval Europe relatively recently - with the Spanish Tercios of the mid 1500s.  Before that, and for a long time after that wars between feudal lords were fought almost exclusively by proxy mercenary armies.  Some wars were fought almost exclusively by mercenaries on both sides.  Anyone who had some money and a claim could raise an army and cause general havoc among established nation states.  This was a serious problem that caused frequent chaos, enabling non state actors to act as nation states.  Coups, looting, unrest, all this enabled by the heavy use of mercenaries.  This is the problem the the conventions seek to address - by eliminating the ability of non state actors to purchase foreign armies that can overrun countries.\n\nBlackwater, in that context are really not what would be recognized as mercenaries in a historical context.  For the most part, they are citizens of the state they fight for, they don't have the ability to wage a war on their own.  For example, you couldn't just buy Blackwater services to take over a country and install yourself as king.  And so, Blackwater is probably more similar to a volunteer based state actor regular army, than a non state mercenary per the Geneva convention.  There's nowhere in the convention that defines a mercenary as someone who doesn't receive a direct salary from the state.  Many of the first professional militarized were not compensated this way.",
                "I thought Blackwater changed its name and was going to or did merge with Triple Canopy. ",
                "You can't use mercenaries to fight your war but you can hire them to provide security for your personnel.  \n\nAlso the part of the definition of mercenaries is that they are not nationals of one of the nations involved.  So if all your mercenaries are from your nation you get a pass.",
                "America decided that international courts don't apply to them  \nNicaragua case: - international court says 'hey america, stop running around with soldiers in a foreign country' court rules 'we're the law', by that logic, no court can prosecute america.    \nUN prosecuting body the international criminal court- america makes it not have universal jurisdiction so they only apply to nations that join up. - Henry Kissinger is the driving force behind this.  \nBut what if your on a signatories land doing war crimes, what if afghanistan is signed up?. - America creates bilaterial immunity agreements (Coined 'bilateral impunity agreement') with nations saying 'here take some money and write into statute, if you prosecute our people we'll find them and take em back'  - E.g Afghanistan signed this for an 8 billion infrastructure deal.  \nI have sources but I'm writing this pretty quickly, feel free to challenge me I'm sure there's more to it.",
                "Blackwater(and other such compares) are hired as bodyguards/guards(and along these lines) and not as mercenaries which is why they are \"legal\". Mercenaries are paid to fight a war and are hired to engage enemies. Blackwater does not necessarily engage enemies(unless attacked) but who knows, they could be willingly driving in some area known as an enemy territory, see some people and attack them because they are \"suspicious\", \"on the verge of attacking\" or as a \"precautionary defense\".\n",

I know it seems like a slight difference, but it means a lot in terms of ROE (rules of engagement). I'm an Army Vet and I worked with a lot of paramilitary contractors. ",

                "I could not say if he was the \"first\" candidate to do so, but Lyndon Johnson, in his 1948 race for Texas's vacant U.S. Senate seat against retired Governor Coke Stevenson, relied on a _significant_ fundraising disparity to close the gap between him, and the massively popular Texas statesman. \n\nRobert Caro's _Years of Lyndon Johnson_ -- and especially book 2, _Means of Ascent_ -- describes Johnson's political empire as a little-discussed network of major corporate donors, forming a veritable who's-who of major Texas industrialists: Sid Richardson (oil magnate and philanthropist [he was later a major donor to Rice University]) , Herman Brown and George R. Brown of Brown  &  Root (which would be acquired by Halliburton on the latter's death), and Alan J. Wirtz (businessman/politician). Money made its way to Johnson's campaigns through the ordinary means of above-board contributions up to the then-existing limit of $5,000.00; then, it reached him in cash-stuffed envelopes, hand-collected and hand-delivered by aides. \n\nAll of this meant that when Johnson declared against Stevenson, the latter's ordinary time-tested means of campaigning -- driving town to town, sitting and speaking with voters in town squares -- was quickly overmatched. By circumventing campaign finance caps, Johnson was able to blanket the Texas airwaves in a manner unprecedented in early-modern politics -- helped, of course, by the fact that he owned, through is wife, several major local radio stations -- and even hired two helicopters to take him on a jet-age version of a whistle-stop tour of the state. \n\nEven that wasn't enough to win the race, which dissolved into allegations of vote-rigging and fraud, and ultimately had to be resolved [in court](_URL_0_) when Johnson claimed to have \"won\" by under 100 votes. Caro makes a persuasive case, based on an interview with the only south-Texas party operative still alive at the time he wrote the book, that the decisive votes were in fact invented. It's a good and depressing read.\n\nNote: the $5,000.00 limit Johnson worked under (and circumvented) was a product of the 1939 Hatch Act. The Federal Election Campaign Act of 1972 would lower the individual cap to $1,000.00 per candidate, with a per-cycle individual cap of $25,000.00. The per-candidate and aggregate caps were both found constitutional in *Buckley v. Valeo*, 424 U.S. 1 (1976). The aggregate cap was invalidated in the recent case of *McCutcheon v. F.E.C.*, 572 U.S. ___ (2014), and the $1,000.00/candidate cap was increased by the \"McCain/Feingold\" Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act.",

                "Rachel Herrmann published a great article about this a few years ago in *William and Mary Quarterly* - you can find it [here](_URL_0_).  She argues that while \"historians generally take the case of cannibalism in Jamestown for\ngranted\" in fact \"the existence of cannibalism in Virginia is not easily verifiable.\" While Herrmann acknowledges accounts like John Smith's:\n\n >  so great was our famine, that a Salvage we slew, and buried,\nthe poorer sort tooke him up againe and eat him, and so did divers\none another boyled and stewed with roots and herbs: And one\namongst the rest did kill his wife, powdered her, and had eaten\npart of her before it was knowne, for which hee was executed, as\nhee well deserved; now whether shee was better roasted, boyled\nor carbonado’d, I know not, but of such a dish as powdered wife I\nnever heard of\n\nHerrmann argues that:\n\n > Cannibalism may or may not have taken\nplace during 1609–10; some evidence exists to suggest that it did, whereas\nother accounts might be cited to argue that it did not. Ultimately, there is\nno way to answer this particular question definitively... What historians can do is consider the various accounts together and acknowledge that cannibalism should no longer be stated as a bare fact in the chronology of early Jamestown.\n\n**The kicker here** is that 2 years after Herrmann published, archeologists announced that they had uncovered **physical evidence of cannibalism:** the remains of a young girl (about age 14), who had very clearly been dismembered, and whose bones were found in a heap of bones from dogs, cats, and horses that had also been consumed during the starving time:\n\n > “The chops to the forehead are very tentative, very incomplete,” says Douglas Owsley, the Smithsonian forensic anthropologist who analyzed the bones after they were found by archaeologists from Preservation Virginia. “Then, the body was turned over, and there were four strikes to the back of the head, one of which was the strongest and split the skull in half. A penetrating wound was then made to the left temple, probably by a single-sided knife, which was used to pry open the head and remove the brain.”\n\n > [...]\n\n > Lead archaeologist William Kelso today at a press conference at the National Museum of Natural History, we now have the first direct evidence of cannibalism at Jamestown, the oldest permanent English colony in the Americas. “Historians have gone back and forth on whether this sort of thing really happened there,” Owsley says. “Given these bones in a trash pit, all cut and chopped up, it's clear that this body was dismembered for consumption.”\n\n[source](_URL_1_)\n\nThe archeological evidence is pretty conclusive, and it's confirmation that settlers were desperate enough to eat other people (along with dogs, cats, horses, etc).

                "There is no real rule of thumb. It depends on the balance of power and the prestige of the various languages, although population size can have an influence. For instance, Gaul was romanised because the Roman culture became the more prestigious one in the region. So first the local elite started speaking Latin, and then it seeped down to the rest of the population. By the time the Franks came, Latin was the still the language of prestige (since the Roman empire still existed), and Latin was also the language of the majority of the population, so they adopted Latin.\n\nIn Britain on the other hand, Latin had never rooted as much, and the Anglo-Saxons brought a new culture of prestige, so over time their language became the prestigious one.\n\nUltimately, it is impossible to predict, as it always is with language change. Prestige and population size are important, but it also depends on how stubborn people are, how much communication there is between the speakers of the different languages, how much a ruler might press the use of his native language, and all kinds of factors."

                "So the cool thing about biology is that we're all just \"chemistry buckets\". We're just a lot of very advanced chemistry, and chemistry dictates everything we are.\n\nProteins are a family of molecule that are actually very diverse. They can make structures, like cell walls and fingernails. But again -- just chemicals. They're not \"smart\". A protein has a job to do, and it does it. Keratin, which is one of the proteins that make up hair and nails, is shaped so that it lines itself up into structures. \n\nOther proteins carry \"messages\" from one place to another. Really that just means that some protein is sent into the blood, where it travels the whole body -- cause again, just a sack of chemistry -- and eventually it'll find a place that it fits. And when it does \"fit\" into something, that something may react, maybe by producing other chemicals.\n\nProteins also break down other materials (enzymes), can attack pathogens, and do lots more. \n\nDNA itself is the protein cookbook. It's also just a chemical; a huge one, but a chemical nonetheless. In labs, to inspect DNA, they actually grow more of it. You just take DNA, and throw it into a soup of other chemicals that replicate DNA (those same chemicals found in the body) and then you cook it, and boom, you have a lot more DNA.\n\nEither way, there's another chemical that interacts with DNA. It latches onto a bit of DNA, takes its shape, falls away and then another chemical comes in and builds a protein from that shape. It's almost like taking a cast and then a mold of something you want to sculp. The DNA is huge and \"codes\" lots of different proteins -- all your proteins, in fact -- but the RNA only needs to interact with a section at a time. \n\nAnd remember still, nothing \"smart\" is happening here. It's just several chemical reactions, one after another. \n\nBut because DNA is the template for every protein your body uses, it defines your whole body. There's one protein that causes the gold flecks around the ring of your iris (in your eye) -- some people have it, some people don't. But at no point do these biological tools make \"decisions\"; the DNA doesn't \"control\" a cell in the sense that it's directing traffic. It's just a very complex system of different chemicals interacting with each other and producing different effects."

We don't really know how likely it is for life to begin from scratch. Nick Lane is a well-known author and researcher who has [written on the subject](_URL_1_).\n\nSome strong indicators might be: \n\nIf it did not use DNA or RNA to store information.\n\nIt might not be carbon-based life, which would be good evidence it was not terrestrial. \n\nWe can trace the origins of a subset of genes (~6000) back to a single [common ancestor](_URL_2_), so if it lacked any version of these genes it would be a strong indicator. \n\nThe Venter Institute has being doing some [cool experiments](_URL_0_) looking for the minimal genome, and have gotten it down to ~250 genes that are essential to life, so if something was existing with a different set of core genes that could be a strong indicator.",

It could be the alien lifeform is based on different chemistry, or perhaps it's similar but has unusual chromosomes. Something to that effect. \n\nIt would be compelling if there was something that was from their own evolution path that allowed them to exist on specifically other planets, which wouldn't be necessary on Earth like not needing oxygen.",

                "Assuming this hypothetical alien has DNA, a good way to determine non-terrestrial origin would be to isolate the [Base Pairs](_URL_0_) in said DNA. All life on Earth uses the same nucleobases of Cytosine, Guanine, Adenine, and Thymine (and in RNA, Thymine is replaced by Uracil). If the lifeform's DNA (or DNA-analog) does not utilize the same nucleobases, then it is safe to say that it evolved from a different \"primordial ooze\". \n\nAs others have also said, however, isotope ratios would also point to an origin other than Earth or even our solar system. This pertains to the original formation of our solar system, and the geological process that resulted in heavier elements (easily identifiable, radioactive elements in trace amounts) that are ubiquitous in life on Earth. Different types of stars produce different amounts of various elements, and the ratios would easily identify a nonterrestrial origin.",
                "If it is DNA based, compare codon sequences for the amino acids. It is highly unlikely that there would be much similarity to life on Earth.

                "Older answer from the Waterloo AMA:\n\nNo. Britain had plenty of festivities planned but they were mostly cancelled. \n\nMany of the usual activities for Waterloo celebrations were impossible or impractical. Dinners between regiments were impractical because of the war. Visits to the battlefield were planned but cancelled because the Germans currently occupied the battlefield. The Royal United Services had planned to unveil a Waterloo museum, but it was pushed back. \n\nOf course the victors at Waterloo still used it for propaganda purposes. Images of Wellington and Blucher were still positive. But most of the German celebrations focused on the liberation of Germany from occupying French forces in 1812 (there were massive celebrations in Germany to commemorate the anniversary in 1912) as opposed to Waterloo. \n\nEdit:\n\nJust to add Russia had issues celebrating because they had been moving closer towards France and thus had issues celebrating victories over Napoleon. \n\nAustria had issues celebrating because they had no victories over Napoleon to celebrate (heh). \n ",
                "The Battle of Waterloo occupied an anomalous place in 1915. The battle site itself had narrowly avoided becoming a battlefield the prior year and the Germans controlled this corner of Flanders for the remainder of the conflict. Although the local German commander of the region held a small parade on the centennial, according to an American journalist, the German commander used it as an opportunity to harangue the British for their perfidy. The largest Waterloo celebration was arguably at Hanover, where an estimated crown of 100000 gathered at the Waterloo Column to celebrate the past victory of German arms. Hanover's museum held an exhibition of Waterloo artifacts, but only those of German provenance. Hanover was the exception and because wartime events had forced the cancellation of parades and celebratory reenactments of Waterloo, both Britons and Germans had to devise creative means to mark the occasion of the centennial. \n\nA good deal of the celebrations were symbolic in nature.  In the context of the entente, one of the more obvious ways to simultaneously memorialize Waterloo and serve the war effort was to stage commemorations of the battle as symbols of international reconciliation with France. For example, on the June anniversary witnessed *The Times* recorded several instances of reconciliation on both a state and private level. In Paris, the oldest British residents “placed a wreath in the new cemetery at Neuilly- sur-Seine, where lie many French and British soldiers who fought and fell in the Battle of the Marne.” The London authorities placed a heart-shaped ivy wreath, wrapped with a tricoleur ribbon, around Wellington’s equestrian statue in Hyde Park. Paris matched this courtesy by attaching bouquets of red, white, and blue carnations around the wax statues of Napoleon and Wellington in Madame Tussard’s museum.  Furthermore, the centenary memory would develop further the idea that Waterloo represented a titanic military struggle between two equals. A Times editorial stated that:\n\n > To remember [Waterloo] is to praise [French] qualities; for we should recall this victory with less pride had it been gained over an army less glorious and a captain less renowned; and for all our appreciation of- Wellington’s genius and of the courage and tenacity of \tour soldiers, we know well how easily victory might have been turned into defeat had not \tNapoleon's good fortune deserted him on the field of battle.\n \nTwo weeks prior to the centennial, the Royal Artillery elected to honor the graves of its Waterloo fallen. Eventually they found forty-one graves and placed a small wreath on them.  At a Waterloo Day luncheon in Woolwich the Royal Artillery officers present marked the event with a quiet remembrance. According to a publication put out by the Royal Artillery, the officers  were asked to “honor the names and memories of Artilleryman of all ranks, who fought at Waterloo and to remember those men of today who are fighting with the same bravery as our men of 1815.”  At Wellington College, annual Waterloo Day Banquet, originally funded by a subscription from Wellington himself, had been cancelled in lieu of a memorial service for the alumni killed in the current conflict. *The Times* reported that before the ceremony, the current Duke of Wellington planted an acorn taken from the grave of Copenhagen, Wellington’s famous horse.  Both the Wellington College ceremony and that of the Royal Artillery prefigured that of the postwar commemorations of the war which involve gestures and solemnity to properly honor the dead.\n\nGerman symbolic commemoration often took the form of contextualizing the dead within the context of the German *Heimat* or homeland. One of the *Heimat* journals  *Niedersachsen* bimonthly published a special centennial issue. The expressed hope of this issue’s editor was the erection of a worthy monument for the King’s German Legion will be erected in Hannover when the chance of an honorable peace is near.  This issue celebrated the heroes of Lower Saxony, including luminaries like Duke Frederick William and the general Christian von Ompteda, but the issue also delved into the life of the ordinary soldier as well. For example, the issue reproduced the silhouette of sergeant in a minor militia battalion.  Although not completely free of the wartime-era bombast, the commemorative issue reproduced many of the existing monuments and gravesites of the Lower Saxon Waterloo heroes, thus grounding the memory into local culture. The issue closed with a use of commemorative memory that drew an indirect but distinct comparison to the current wartime environment: a list of the dead and wounded officers from Quatre-Bras and Waterloo, arranged by unit, rank, and name.  In this circuitous way, this *Heimat*-centered centennial of Waterloo draws upon the power of the dead by recreating a more modern form of remembrance.\n\nBut beyond just commemorating the dead, the centennial in wartime was often an excuse to trot out chauvinism and mobilize the past to fight the present conflict. One curious example of this iteration of memory was when both nations engaged in a loose dialogue with each other around a curious rumor about the Lion’s Mound at Waterloo. 18 June issue of *The Times* reported that 1,500 German soldiers were at work to dismantle the 31-ton bronze lion atop one of the most prominent landmarks of the battlefield, the massive artificial earth embankment erected to honor the Prince of Orange in 1820.  The article cited an anonymous source for this story and treated it as a straightforward example of German destruction of Belgian monuments such as the destruction of Louvain the year before. In reality, the Lion’s Mound remained intact during the war and the The Times story has all the symptoms of typical wartime atrocity rumor. Such accounts frequently combined an unsubstantiated report from a few witnesses with a strong tendency to believe in the enemy’s worst instincts.  Rather than let this bit of wartime gossip lie fallow, the German magazine *Jugend* with  a comedic retort to this British atrocity story. After reassuring its readers that the story is false, the magazine published a poem “Der Löwe von Waterloo” by A. D. Nora wherein the lion itself had abandoned the field due to the behavior of the British:\n\n  > When he saw Wellington’s heirs allied [with the French]\n >  Murderously full of hate and anger\n > towards the grandchildren of Blücher’s\n > German blood, the Germanic blood of\n > The noble lion seized\n > Such loathing of today\n > That he tucked in his tail \n > And with animalistic haste\n > Descended from its heights\n > And no one knows whither he fled\n > Yes, that I could understand well\n > Poor Lion of Waterloo! \n\nAlthough comedic in tone, the poem insinuated British malfeasance when they elected to side with the French. The lion’s disgust with this choice amounted to an assertion by A. D. Nora that contemporary Britons had relinquished their birthright to the battle.\n\n"

                "Volunteer fire fighter here. Our station is ran by the county. Our city owns a very old (50s) fire truck and the county loans the other two. We are insured by the county and receive survivor benefits in case of Injury. As far as being paid, these outfits are usually in locations where the city is unable to afford it and relies on volunteers. Realistically it is volunteer so if somebody doesn't feel like going they have nobody to answer to. Hopefully I answered your question.",
                "My father worked as a volunteer firefighter in his township for many years. More or less it was just a tiny little town with a bunch of townies hopping on the truck. Population was next to nothing. I think it peaked under 600?\n\nHe had scanners set up in one of the offices that he could hear throughout the lower level of the house and he carried the push to talk Nextel of the time. The town was small enough that the post office didn’t even deliver. So the guys would hear the call, hop in the car and respond. \n\nSomething like 80% of that town lived below the poverty line, and realistically they couldn’t afford full time firefighters. County took the calls and put them out on the radio as reported structure fires, accidents with entrapment and the guys just ran. If I remember correctly neighboring townships responded to fires as well. Everyone just sort of showed up.",
                "I was a volunteer FF back when I was younger. The village I grew up in was 100% volunteer. No paid skeleton crew or drivers. To staff a paid department costs lots of taxpayer dollars. Yes, the firehouses and gear costs, but think about the salaries, benefits, utilities for the crews while on duty. It adds up to lots of money. And this was mid 80s when you didn't have the level of gear that's around now, and required. It was sort of unspoken that if an employee working in town for you was a volunteer, you allowed them to respond. It wasn't required, but it could be your house I was responding to. At any given fire call, you could have maybe 5-8 guys (at the time we didn't have any females), or 35. Just depended on the time, day, weather. Yes, there were those that you knew wouldn't respond after a certain time, or if it was raining/snowing out. They were more members for the social, and networking aspects of it. The dedicated guys were the ones that were there at 3am to a known false alarm (the typical pulled ones or faulty alarms), or still there at 2am rolling up hoses after the call.",
                "Yeah so often times in the volunteer depts they have a cheif and maybe an assistant chief that are paid. Other than that everyone is volunteer. But here's the thing, in a very rural town where there isn't a lot to do, church, school and the Vol Fire dept are your social clubs. So basically in the small towns they guys all build up a friendship with each other so people will always show up because that's what you do for your friend.",
                "I'm on a small \"volunteer\" fire department. We don't have enough money or calls to have a crew of guys sitting at the station getting paid all day so we all go about our day and respond to calls when they come in and when we can. Sometimes we're short staffed and call in mutual aid from a nearby department. We do get paid tho, something to the tune of $30-40 a call. That can be good pay for a silly disregard or shit pay for a 4 hour fire, but I find that the guys here don't care much about the money. We get something in the range of 5 calls a week, usually at 3:00 am or so🙃. \nWe train twice a month and have a meeting once a month.

Small towns would either have to do without a fire department or rely on nearby cities to dispatch firefighters to them.\n\n\"Volunteer\" firefighters have regular jobs, but carry a pager so they can respond to fires (or sometimes as support to paramedics) in town.\n\nWhile they're on a call they're usually paid a little bit. They also get pretty solid tax incentives where I'm from. They also get the training they would need to get hired as a career firefighter.\n\nIt's a good gig...",
                "I was a volunteer firefighter in Suburban Philadelphia for around 20 years.  I'm still a \"member\" of the company but I no longer go out on fire calls.\n\nIn our situation, the fire station is owned by the township along with the fire apparatus (four engines, a ladder truck, a rescue truck and a utility \"tactical\" vehicle).  The firefighting gear is owned by the fire company, which is a non-profit corporation.  Funds to purchase equipment are provided by a \"Relief Association\" which is a separate nonprofit corporation that gets its funding from the state.  The state gets the money from a tax that it imposes on insurance companies that write policies on properties in the township.  If you buy homeowners or property insurance, a portion of your premium goes to the state via a tax, which is dedicated to the local volunteer fire company to fund equipment purchases (turnout gear, air packs, rubber gloves, medical equipment, etc.).\n\nWe also have pledge drives where we'd send out requests for donations to the public.\n\nAs to why they're not paid?  It costs a lot of money to outfit a paid fire department.  Salaried firefighters are not cheap, and they usually require decent benefit and pension packages  Money doesn't grow on trees so towns with paid fire departments have to raise taxes to pay for them.  Most suburban and rural towns don't have enough incidents to justify a full-time paid department and the substantial increase in tax burden that it would bring.\n\nThe problem today is that there aren't enough volunteers.  We rely on \"mutual aid\" systems where if there's an incident in my township, the county will dispatch fire companies from neighboring townships and boroughs too in order to help insure that enough people show up.  The best time to have your house catch on fire is 7:30 on a Tuesday night when we're all at the fire house for training.  The worst time is 1:00 on a weekday afternoon when everyone is at work or school and can't get away to run off to the fire station.",

It is up to the members to decide how to spend the money (following municipal fiscal policies)\nWe are 100% volunteer and receive no financial compensation.\n We do not have the population density to justify hiring career firefighters, the municipality just wouldn't be able to afford it, which I would say is the case for most of Canada and the United States, the tax base just isn't there to support paid firefighters.",

I typically receive about 600 dollars a year, a tax credit, and a couple free meals."

Try it with fruit, like fresh cut peaches and cream. Try it in your coffee and watch it unfurl...it's absolutely beautiful.  It is probably the only cream I would put in tea.  You would use this for making homemade ice cream.\n\nLight cream is the lighter, less fat version of heavy cream. No good use, since if you want \"diet\" cream you came to the wrong place. You probably should just be using less heavy cream. \n\nWhipping cream is for whipping.  Add sugar. Takes alot of arm strength, or a mixer.  I believe it is lighter than regular heavy cream which helps it to whip easier. I don't know about heavy whipping cream, as I've only tried to make homemade whipped cream once and I dont know if I bought whipping cream or heavy whipping cream.",

I've tried them all. I always have some on hand - it's a staple.\n\nIt is perfect in coffee in the morning, providing a richness with less cream needed vs. say a half-and-half. It blends nice when I mix it with marinara for a cream sauce on pasta, works great in home made cream of chicken soup, is amazing poured over sliced up strawberries or peaches with a sprinkle of sugar, adding a smidge gives fluffiness to scrambled eggs, and I can flat out make kick-ass whip cream from it that puts cool whip to shame, for dessert / milkshake toppings, etc.\n\nYep, heavy whipping cream.

                "Adapted from an earlier answer of mine.\nThe focus is less on the Cuban economic situation (which I'm less familiar with) and more on why the Cuban international missions proved a durable strategy, with a focus on Angola.\n\n\n\nFrom the start, Cuba's military interventions were accompanied by social contributions, also drawing on the experiences of the extensive inner-Cuban literacy and medical campaigns that began shortly after the revolution. F. Castro had spoken out against the perils of illiteracy as early as 1953, and initiated a national literacy campaign in 1961. While official figures have to be treated with caution, we know that the 8-month long campaign was a success, and led to UNESCO declaring the country free of illiteracy. Another point to keep in mind here is Cuba's tactic of international solidarity, which could mean military aid esp. in the 60s' and 70s', but also and increasingly after the fall of the Soviet Union a form of \"medical diplomacy\". Humanitarian missions were meant to improve Cuba's foreign relations. With the end of the Soviet Union, then Cuba's main economic and military supporter, there was a marked shift from military to humanitarian interventions, with Cuba's foreign troops returning home. \n\nI won't go into detail here because of the 25 years rule, but a few years ago around 35,000 Cubans were still occupied in more than 70 countries in various fields. On the one hand, we have cases of Cuba gaining new allies through emergency aid (as in Honduras), and of medical exchanges connected to economic advantages, as with Venezuelan oil payments. On the other hand, it seems difficult not to see a motivation of solidarity and cooperation at play in these large-scale actions, as with the medical school ELAM which educates international students mostly free of charge, in order to let them use this knowledge in their home countries - also strengthening Cuba's prestige e.g. in Latin America and Africa.\n\nDuring the campaign in Angola, the Cuban-Angolan cooperation was the basis for the construction of governmental structures and of national education there, employing around 50,000 Cuban civilians until 1991 and thereby strengthening the MPLA's position. I'm going into this Angolan example some more below to show how especially educational aid could function, as well as its limitations - hopefully as a useful parallel to your question on medical aid, which would often (but not always) be used in tandem.\n\n​**Cuban education in Angola**\n\nIn a fascinating book on the topic (\"*Kubaner in Angola: Süd-Süd-Kooperation und Bildungstransfer 1976-1991*\"), Christine Hatzky talks of \"South-South cooperation\", highlighting how two non-Western countries worked together in times of the Cold War -- both in order to further their own goals. Turning to Angola: From the early 1960's opposition to the Portuguese colonial regime had started forming. Following the military coup in Portugal 1974, there started the war for independence between various native movements. In 1975 the Angolan MPLA declared independence, backed by the USSR and Cuba. This led to a decades-long civil war with another liberation movement called UNITA until 1991, but continuing afterwards, who had South African (and at some point indirect US) backing.\n\nAlready during the conflict for independence, cooperation between Cuba and Angola constituted a main basis for the construction of political structures in post-colonial Angola. The educational cooperation also meant that methods for stabilising rule were brought from Cuba to Angola, serving to strenthen the MPLA's predominance. The construction of a nation-wide public educational system was an important addition to this tactic -- it was made possible through the employment of thousands of Cuban teachers and pedagogues. It was the biggest civil foreign mission of Cuba until 1991, spanning ca. 50.000 civilians in total, and ca. 10.000 active in education.\n\nBoth powers followed their own political interests in this educational policy in a relatively equal way, without direct interference by the Cold War powers. On the other hand, the Angolan government often made demands on Havana. Angola had a certain leverage due to their financing of the civilian mission, which was kept secret by Havana even from the civilians themselves. Because of this the mission \"based only on solidarity\" as propagated by the Cuban government has to be challenged -- we rather see a direct support of the MPLA, from which Havana profited directly. In the end, the commonly proclaimed goals of the creation of a socialist Angola were not realized, as the MPLA started applying stronger capitalist policies from the 80s onwards.\n\nNow for some more details on the educational policies: The Cuban civilans supported administration and control of the territories claimed by the MPLA. However, due to the mission's large scale the indigenous development of an Angolan educational system was strongly disrupted. For one, not enough Angolan teachers were educated.\n\nOn the one hand the comparatively innovative pedagogical measures taken by Cuban teachers helped to overcome the colonial educational system. On the other hand this was relativized through internal rules: Thus the teachers' work was only measured by the succesfull holding of exams, not by a sustainable transmission of knowledge. One exemption can be mentioned, the formation of a small but very influential Angolan elite, connected to their education in Angola and in Cuban boarding schools.\n\nVarious factors have to be taken into account when talking of a 'failure' of the educational cooperation. First and foremost, it took place during times of civil war, in addition to major South African military interventions. These military conflicts strongly disrupted an literacy campaign (modeled on  the Cuban experience). They also meant that many of the Cuban civilians employed in Angola were traumatised by their time in the country -- something not discussed publicly in Cuba until now. The official Cuban discourse rather highlights the military successes esp. after 1991 - including the decisive Cuban assistance during the huge Cuito Canavale battle, which rebuffed South African involvement in the civil war, and is a reason why Cuba was/is seen as an influence on the end of apartheid in independent South Africa..\n\nIn truth, the small advances made in Angolan education, infrastructure, administration and medicine due to Cuban civil aid were destroyed since the mid '80s by the opponents of war. Until 1992 the Cuban civilians were gradually recalled. One major consequence for Cuba was the professionalisation and economisation of international solidarity, esp. through the building of administrative structures in Angola but also in Cuba itself -- influencing later Cuban humanitarian missions.\n\n---------\n\n**Coming back to your question:** at least for the discussed fields of medical and educational aid, these were strongly tied to Cuban advances made after the revolution. Especially the large scale literacy campaign; and the strong focus on medical education and medical campaigns (including vaccinations and cataract surgery) in Cuba. Cuba could then (and still does) build on these advances in order to \"export\" their expertise as a medical diplomacy - both to gain economic benefits in return, and tied to the ideology of solidarity. These measures have become more important since the fall of the Soviet Union and the end of Soviet military and economic assistance, with such diplomacy providing benefits including oil and allies.\n\n-----------\n\nIncreasingly by the 80s/early 90s, the military missions were seen as less successful than the non-military aid (excluding Cuito Canavale) - with e.g. Che Guevara's doomed Congo mission in the 60s.\nI didn't go into more detail so far on the many main cases of Cuban \"medical diplomaty\" because they mostly fall outside of the 25 years rule, so will just add a bit on those since they seem relevant to the question - they can generally be considered much more successful than the Angolan case. For a few more numbers, since 1960 about 130.000 Cubans have participated in international missions, to places including Guatemala, Pakistan, Bolivia, Indonesia, Beliz, Peru, Mexico, Ecuador, China, El Salvador and Chile for desaster aid. In those 50 years of medical cooperation, more than 85 million patients were treated.\n\nJust to add a more current example, the well-known 'Operacion Milagro' ran in Venezuela from 2005. With the comparatively simple and cheap cataract operations, it's made possible for people to read (again) on a large scale. A different example is the literacy campaign in Bolivia run from 2006 - 2008 with the help of Cuban teachers. Such actions can boost Cuban presitige in these countries in Latin America, but also in Africa and increasingly in Asia, as mentioned above.

I'm hoping you guys can either help me debunk it, or even prove me wrong.\n\nHis suggestion is as follows: Lets say you have a pressure vessel containing gas at 300 bar. You put this 300 bar pressure vessel inside a second pressure vessel which contains gas at 200 bar. And you then put THAT pressure vessel inside a third vessel containing gas at 100 bar. You now have a russian doll pressure vessel system. His theory is that each pressure vessel will need only be designed to withstand 100 bar of pressure since the delta between each layer is 100 bar.\n\nSupposedly this theory would extend to 1000 bar and beyond. \n\nPurely based on theory and ignoring the practicalities of transferring gas in/out of the tanks - is this true/not true and if so, why?",

                "So I am but a humble 3rd year mech. Enr. Student but if these tanks will be used for supplying fuel to something, then in practice this theory may only work via static pressure, the forces being acted upon the Inner walls of the inner vessel would become more prominent as the gas is used from the outer vessel and vice versa, if you use gasses from the inner vessel the outer vessel will impart more forces upon the outer shell of the inner vessel and as you will basically have a section of vacuum inside your other vessel. Now if your vessels are being drained equally in theory this could work assuming uniform pressure ergo your tanks would probably have to be round and there would have to be a perfect seal seperating the outer vessel from the inner vessel with the only point of connection being a one way T valve valve outside of the tanks.\n\nEdit: if you really want to find out then do hoop stress calculations pressure*radius/thickness, there are a few assumptions you can make such as the pressure of the Gass will impart half of its total pressure on the inner walls of the outer vessel and half of its pressure on the outer wall of the inner most pressure, if you have 500 psi in the outer pressure vessel and 250 psi in the inner pressure vessel theoretically the walls of the inner pressure vessel should feel next to no stress other than the compressive forces of the gasses.\n\nEdit2: TLDR, your collegue theory may be true but only in the case that we don't ignore practicalities and such.",

If you can nest every part of your system like that then you can reduce the stress on each layer.  \n\nWhy isn't this the normal way of handling high pressures? Imagine having to build it.  Imagine having to modify parts of the system once it's built.  Imagine having to inspect the system.  It's an absolute nightmare at every level.",
                "I'm an engineer who works with pressure systems. That works on paper, but there are practical problems.\n\n1. Manufacturing: Creating nested means you have more seals between vessels which are prone to leaking, not to mention difficulty of assembly\n2. Inspection: How are you going to inspect the inner vessels?\n3. Pressure regulation? Say you actually need it at 1000 bar. Then you need to regulate the pressure at 900 bar, 800 bar, etc.\n3. Failure: If one fails, then its going to cause a larger than intended pressure differential, and you will have a bad day. (Admittedly, if you have a single vessel that ruptures, you will still have a very bad day. But there will be less shrapnel).\n5. They make pressure vessels that go to 150 Kpsi+. Is this not enough?\n6. As an afterthought, qualifying it would be difficult. A normal pressure vessel would be simple: Do not use above X psi. Put a relief valve on it and done. Safe. With the nested vessel thing, someone's going to mess up and rupture it.\n"

                "\"Jerry\" as a term for German troops is probably a diminutive of \"German\".   It was in use by  British troops in France by early 1916.   The Daily Express quoted it in March 1916 and in September 1916 explained it as \" \"Jerries\" - That is the \"official\" Irish designation of the enemy.\"   It does not appear to have been a particularly derogative term.\n\n\nThe term \"Tommy\" is an abbreviation of \"Thomas Atkins\", a generic term for British soldiers since at least 1815 when the British War Office released the \"General Regulations and Orders\" with sample forms and directions for record keeping where the forms showing how to complete soldiers records used the generic name \"Thomas Atkins\" as an example.   The usage of the name as an exemplar for forms continued to appear in the 1832 version of the direction \"On The Enlisting, The Discharging, and The Pensioning of Soldiers\" and has continued.   By the 1860s, soldiers were commonly using the term in reference to themselves.   There is a complaint letter in the Soldiers Gazette of 1864 signed by \"Tommy Atkins\". In 1890 Rudyard Kipling wrote the poem \"Tommy\", published in the collection \"Barrack Room Ballads\" which established the term as an identifier for the British soldier throughout the English speaking world. \n "

They'll remain a fan long after they graduate, and their kids will probably be fans too.\n\nAs far as the South in particular: in the early 20th century, with a down economy and a whole host of other issues, people in the South had little to be proud of. When their college football teams started winning, they latched onto it as something that they could take pride in. That continues to this day.",
                "It's not that much different than fans of pro sports - It's just that the southeast region of the country was really Underserved by pro teams of any sport.\n\nLook at Baseball - for the longest time, it was pretty much the Braves for that entire region. Other sport leagues are similar, although it has slowly changed.\n\nSo, if your dad and your grandpa were huge fans of Alabama or ole Miss, and went to or listened to every game - guess what you will probably grow up being a fan of?\n\nFWIW, i grew up in NC, where ACC Basketball was king. I think most people who grew up local have more interest to ACC basketball than they do to any professional sport (Except maybe NASCAR), even though now there are pro Football, Hockey and Basketball teams. \n\n",
                "I am from the South, and football is a huge part of the culture. Even Friday Night football at the local high schools is a big event, and it gets competitive. There aren't many pro teams close by, so there's more emphasis on high school and college football there      \n\nBecause of the competiton, a lot of good talent is cultivated at the high school levels in the area, and they play for local colleges and do well there (again part of the culture is staying closer to home)     \n\nNow good talent from other parts of the country hear about these SEC schools doing well and join one of the schools. Repeat this for a few decades, and you get good coaches, good staff, and good players across the conference      \n\nTL:DR; Southern culture loves football, and over time this helps the SEC become a strong conference",

                "Specifically to the SEC, a large portion of the attention comes from the media.  It creates a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy because several SEC teams have been good for extended periods (Alabama, LSU, etc).\n\nWhat winds up happening is that NEXT year, the media ranks those SEC teams highly - and when they inevitably lose against each other, they fall less in the polls because they lost to another highly ranked team.  In other words, they're tough because we say they're tough, so then they go play other tough teams.\n\nThis problem is not nearly as bad as it had been - the SEC hasn't even been a factor in the last two titles or Heisman winners - so part of that myth is falling away.  \n\nOf course this addresses just the \"SEC-specific\" part of your question.  It's also important to note that college football is very cyclical.  Back in the 80-90s, the old Big 8 ruled the roost with teams like Nebraska and Oklahoma being dominant.  During the early 2000s, you saw the rise of teams like Miami (ACC) and USC (then, Pac-10).  The media loves to jump on a bandwagon and the SEC is only the most recent flavor.",
                "The SEC is kind of an anomaly with the level of fan craziness and the level of success as a collective.  I think there are four major factors in play.  \n\nFirst, the amount of football talent that comes out of these states and usually play SEC schools.  I think four of the top five states for producing NFL talent per capita are SEC states.  While there is incredible talent all over college football, it is just deeper in the SEC.  \n\nSecond, the small town culture.  By that I mean in random towns in places like Alabama, Mississippi, or Louisiana there aren't a lot of options for entertainment on Saturday afternoons.  Here in Louisiana (LSU fan here), Saturdays in football season tend to be centered around where you want to watch the LSU game.  Games become social events.\n\nThirdly, as other have mentioned the lack of NFL teams to root doesn't give people the options football fans in other parts of the country have.  Several SEC schools don't have an NFL team in the state.  \n\nLast, SEC fans figured out that other SEC teams doing well will only help their team in the long run.  The streak of NC's helped build a lot of goodwill with the former BCS and now playoff committee.  There is this uneasy alliance where SEC fans will chant \"SEC\" but absolutely hate each.  ",
                "If you ever get the chance OP, go to an SEC football game (especially one that's a big game or heated rivalry), and you'll understand almost instantly. I was always a casual football fan, but being a student at an SEC school I got free season tickets, went to my first game there and fell in love instantly. There's nothing like it. I'm not a huge sports junkie, but I keep up with my NCAA football from August to September.",

Failure to do so would have profound spiritual repercussions. \n\n >  Knight from Europe going to conquer the Holy Land in the name of God\n\nTo be clear, this is a pretty terrible understanding of what the crusades actually were. Only a very small minority of Crusaders actually stayed in the Levant after fulfilling their pledges to visit the Holy Sepulchre, and while possession of the territory was considered important, crusades were first and foremost an act of penitence just like any other pilgrimage. God, after all, expunge all non-believers from the face of the earth, if he so chose. The Islamic possession of Outremer was thus an opportunity provided by god to aid in your spiritual salvation, regardless of actual outcome.\n\nAlso, the formal position of squire was an innovation which significantly postdates the First Crusade, and it is thus unlikely that you would have existed at all.\n\nSome reading:\n\n* Riley-Smith, Jonathan.

                "OK, a small rant at first- **I'm opening AskHistorian and what I see? Anecdotal evidences and *Romeo and Juliet* cited as a source? Has anybody given it a second thought?**\n\nOK, serious answer, but let's start from the bottom.\nDid people marry so early in the past?\nYes. And No. \nThe false impression that people pushed kids into the bed of elders comes from the fact that most written sources deals with the aristocracy who didn't have to think about common folk's problems (described below) but has the most to win and lose in dynastic games- so yes, they married early, but not as early as one might think. \n\nThe line between betrothal and marriage was often very blurred, negotiations about dowry could take years, changing alliances could make a deal not a deal and force to change it, personal reasons like parents claiming that bride is too young or having problems with letting the child go also played a part- so in fact \"young\" was closer to 17-18 than 12.  \n\nPoorer parts of the societies married even later- woman had to gather dowry, men had to inherit land or learn trade before he could support a family (for example apprentices were usually forbidden from marrying). When we look to parish records, the age of women is often above 20. And don't forget that you had to pay for church marriage and got permission from your lord so it wasn't in uncommon for couples to live as \"common-law marriages\" till they could afford proper wedding.\n\nSo what about those child marriages? Technically they were possible (for girls above 12) and sometimes they happened when the situation pushed- especially when survival of the dynasty was imperilled. Now my personal observation- due to unusual circumstances surrounding those weddings they made it to the literature and public conciousness. So we remember 12 years old princesses marrying old men, but forget about those boring 18 years old marrying young men.  Case from my country- everyone knows that 40 something Władysław II Jagiełło married a 12 years old Jadwiga (their child was born 13 years old after ceremony so who knows what happened in private chambers) but his second and fourth brides were 22 and 17 respectively. And his third bride? Mother of 5, widow after 3 husbands, well over 35. So that's all about anecdotes. \n\nNow let's go to the case- I haven't found details about ceremony, but I doubt that he would actually made out with a child- when the bride was younger than 12 the bedding ceremony turned into purely innocent sleeping side by side. If someone was really eager, he could bare his and her legs up to the knees. After such \"consummation\" marriage still theoretically could be cancelled, but Church jurisdiction simply wouldn't take seriously a full ceremony with so young girl.\nAnd international reaction? Apart from those who actually lost something with this match it was probably \"meh\", since I haven't seen any trace about moral sithstorm you could expect. \n\nEdit: from the initial shock I forget about resources- Jacques le Goff and his \"L'umo medievale\" about the age of marriage and  \"Kronika Kobiet\" by Maria Żmigrodzka-Wolska for details about bedding. \n\n"

In terms of composition that really depends on the director. But one key difference is that they have more time and larger teams to do things than someone not paid to do it. The director gets a shitload of footage to cut together from pieces he or she likes in post production. They storyboard scenes typically and run through them a bunch of times (if time permits), this gives them numerous selections of each frame from the scene, which they can cut together to make the best of what they've got. They also have booms, which are those microphones on sticks that you see in blooper reels. The boom allows them to record audio separate to the camera, which also lets a sound engineer pimp it out to sound ideal for whatever's going on. And let's not underestimate the skill of the camera operators, who've been doing it for years and therefore have excellent motor control, as well as a keen eye for where the camera should be focusing (not just looking in a general direction but where it doesn't blur the image, you'll notice most shows use at least slight depth of field to make the actors or important parts of a shot \"pop\").

An L cut is when the audio from one track starts before the visuals of that shot. This makes the transition into that shot much smoother and less jarring. There are plenty of techniques in editing like this. \n\nEach movie has a rythm in its editing.  An editor needs to find the rythm for the film and edit the film accordingly. For an action flick it probably has a fast rythm. For a romantic drama it might have a slow pace. For fast pace each shot in the time line shouldn't be longer than a few seconds. For slow pace each shot might be 5 seconds or longer. Having a defined rythm really makes a clip more enjoyable and professional. \n\nA lot of amateur editors edit each shot to long. My film teacher would always say only show what you have too and keep each shot as short as possible. (unless you are purposely keeping long takes). \n\nFor sound, recording at least 60 seconds of ambient noise at each location can really help the editor fix audio mistakes. \n\nAlso color grading so that all the shots match in hue and saturation also improves the quality of a video. But if it's over done it can look amateurish. \n\nThat's just some stuff. If anyone is interested I can talk about other techniques and tricks when I get out of class. \n",

You touch a hot plate and even before you can process what happened you pull the hand away, it's a subconscious reflex to avoid harm driven by pain. You see an attractive male/female you sometimes get a desire to have intimate relationship with them, it's a normal biological reaction which helps you have offspring. Animals have the same drive, but aren't held back by social standards, morality etc. They feel hunger, they feel thirst they try to eat/drink. They seek safety, refuge, have urges to protect their offspring. Basically they have every primal instinct we have, but they don't have the ability to process it like we do, to attribute importance to them, to contemplate it.\n\nIn essence they're just a little life form bound by rules of action - reaction caused by chemicals in their body, which are produced for them to react to external stimuli. They aren't self-aware. They are just a biological computer bound by a set of rules, even humans are, only difference is we can evaluate our actions on a deeper level and avoid some of the primal impulses we have, because of our societal guidelines.\n\nI'm sorry if I didn't answer your question like you wanted it to, but I feel like there is no right or wrong answer for it.",
                "No one knows. Consciousness is one of the greatest mysteries of science and philosophy, and, though our instinct might suggest that all moderately complex animals have some form of it, there's relatively no hard evidence one way or another. \n\nAn even more intriguing (yet in some ways itself quite illuminating) question is \"what might consciousness be like for an animal that seems conscious yet has no centralized brain at all, like a lobster?\" Further, if we say something without a centralized brain can have consciousness, who's really to say that something like a plant doesn't?\n\nI'm barely scratching the surface here, so  I'd advise looking elsewhere for perhaps an ELI15 answer. I like Dennett as a jumping off point, but I'm on a mobile so hard to grab a good link. Personally (and this is WIDELY debated), I think many animals likely have some kind of consciousness, but language is the defining feature of anything that looks at all like human consciousness, so much so that you'd barely recognize a chicken's \"consciousness\" as such if you were somehow transported into its head. \n\nEdit: word",
                "Very simple organisms run like a programmed computer. For example, at the cellular level (edit: as in, a single celled organism), consciousness probably doesn't exist. However, as you increase in complexity, you get consciousness. A lot of scientists think that consciousness stems from underlying biological processes, which has sparked the 'does free will even exist' debate (which is a totally different topic). The examples used in your post (rodents and insects) could have consciousness. Many rodents are actually highly and surprisingly intelligent. Insects are more mysterious, they *could* have [consciousness](_URL_0_).",
                "We can't even agree on [what consciousness is like for humans](_URL_0_).  Trying to understand what other, non-human organisms perceive is far more difficult than that.\n\nFrom *what we can observe*, it appears that they operate like biological computers.  However, those same observations can be made about any living creature, including humans.  There have been a lot of studies done which show that humans are less in charge of their own decisions than they think they are (often in the context of making marketing messages more effective).  We have yet to find the part that makes humans conscious individuals instead of just complex biological machines, and such a part may not even exist.  We may very well be nothing but organic computers.\n\nIn other words, we have no firm idea of what consciousness is like in general, and until we do we have no hope of understanding what it's like for any specific creature.",

They pretty much lived in the moment, and while they were biologically the same as you or I, they lacked the ability to talk or anything like that. I think I remember reading about one of them who was eventually rehabilitated and when asked about what life was like before, during those feral years, described it as living in the moment, not being able to think like we do now.

Tap water is generally fairly basic, so unless you add lemon or some other acid to the pot, they'll nearly always change color. If the pot was really acidic, the water would change colors too, but it would end up being fairly red.",
                "_URL_0_\n\nThis deals with baking but it has some useful information.  Here is the part I think probably applies,\n\n*\"Carrots contain pigments that are sensitive to changes in pH balance. When the shreds of carrot come into contact with the alkaline baking soda, a chemical reaction takes place that causes the pigments to change color.\"*\n\nIf you just used tap water to cook the carrots, maybe you have hard water.  Perhaps it was the pan you cooked it in.  Some pans are reactive with certain foods.\n\nHope this helps.",

                "Many anthocyanins (some of which carrots contain) are also polyphenols and as such they may oxidate on contact with air, especially if there's polyphenol oxydase or catechol oxydase present. My theory is that their oxidated forms may react with reduced forms producing charge transfer complexes, which are usually colorful. Such a process causes the browning of apples, potatoes and bananas.\n\nI find the acid-base reaction hypothesis less plausible, as they are usually very fast and the effect would be visible immediately on contact with basic water. On the other hand redox reactions are often much slower and it might take some time before the effect is visible.",
                "This is really interesting, I'm not sure if I can figure out what is causing this. Probably need to do some experiments.\n\nBoiling water will help extract water-soluble pigments from the carrots. I think these are anthocyanins. But what is puzzling is the colour change over a course of a few hours.\n\nSome answers are suggesting that the pH in your tap water is high to begin with, so the carrot water changes colour. But if this were the case, dipping carrots in ammonia will turn them green -- not that I've tried this, but I'm pretty sure this does not happen. If it really did happen, I think we would have more kids doing chemistry experiments with carrots instead of boiling red cabbage to make indicator paper! In other words, if the carrots are responding to a high pH, it should be instantaneous, and not take place over the course of a few hours.\n\nThis points to another mechanism for the colour change. Suppose the chemical structure of those carrot pigments slowly changed over time. Say, they get oxidized. What would its structure be? I wasn't able to find anything on this. Maybe some other compound in the carrots helps this reaction along. But what might this be? I am skeptical of this mechanism because the boiling might have broken down these chemicals already.\n\nSo now, we turn to something else. What if, it's a reaction that involves some ions that result from the tap water and the boiling pot? Maybe these ions get incorporated into those pigments. But I'm not sure about this either. That's an awfully intense green colour you've got there. I can think of some ions that will do this, but I doubt they will be in the water.\n\nBottom line -- not sure of the reason. I'd like to see this repeated actually.\n\nOne piece of information that might be helpful is knowing the pH of the tap water. Try boiling chopped up red cabbage and see what colour it is. That will give us a rough estimate of what the pH is. We'll be able to compare with this picture on Wikipedia: [link](_URL_0_)."

They have gotten worse over the years; especially since I'm both near and far sided.

They'll still book a follow up sight test anyways as that's the rules over here, but it's useful to rule out tiredness, dry eye etc",

Using different plus and minus lenses, we are able to move the location at which light is being focused, giving you clear vision. \n\nThe automated machines, called an autorefractor, uses special images on the cornea, the clear part of the eye, to determine the lens that would be needed for the patient to have clear vision. Accuracy can be tough on these automated machines as optometrists do not want to give a patient whatever the machine says, as it can lead to overminus-ing or overplus-ing the patient, which can have negative impact on vision.

                "One thing is that nicotine and other drugs are designed to increase dopamine levels in the prefrontal cortex - this is not the area of the brain that experiences the dopaminergic declines associated with those who have Parkinson's Disease - their decreases in dopamine levels are primarily in the midbrain (near the substantia nigra).\n\nThat said, I wouldn't be surprised if nicotine's effects were non-selective. One should also examine the effects of other drugs (like ritalin) on Parkinson's too.",
                "It's my understanding that Parkinson's involves the actual death of neurons that produce dopamine. You won't bring those back by smoking cigarettes to release more. Even still, you can't limit this to the mere act of smoking cigarettes. Everything we do that has a reward to it is driven by the dopamine system. Not just cigarette smoking, but sex, eating, taking cocaine, so on. \n\nLastly, I am not a biochemist, but I believe that the way nicotine affects the brain is that it excites acetylcholine release and then inhibits its re-uptake. Additional acetylcholine in the brain would not help the balance of neurotransmitters. ",
                "Before I get to your actual question, let's start with one point. The risk of dying of lung cancer from smoking is 22.1% for a male, and 11% for a woman, approximately 20X higher than a non-smoker. The risk of Parkinson's Disease is 8 in 100,000 as a whole. So, let's assume that smoking has some positive effect in lowering the risk of PD. Trading off reducing the risk of PD by vastly increasing the risk of dying of lung cancer? Bad trade-off. [This study](_URL_0_) does seem to show a correlation between smoking and reducing Parkinson's risk. It does not show a reduction in symptoms once the disease strikes.\n\nAnd remember smoking does not just absolutely cause lung cancer. It vastly increases the risk of emphysema, cardiovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, and other cancers. [Read more.](_URL_1_)\n\nHowever, the problem with the assumption that smoking is a good anti-PD drug is multifold. First of all, it's trying to apply a specific pharmacologic effect with the worst possible drug delivery system ever. So, there is research to develop dopamine agonists with localized delivery that won't kill you like smoking. \n\nIf someone wants an excuse to smoke, they shouldn't use \"I'm preventing Parkinson's Disease\" as one of them. It's a horrible risk trade off. "

                "Difficult to say. Genetics are complicated; not all congenital diseases (that is, diseases you have from birth) are passed to offspring. As well, not all genetic diseases show obviously until much later in life, or maybe not at all (but can still be passed on to offspring). \n\nAt the end of the day, while a eugenics program may sound like a good idea, historically they've had some pretty bad results (like the Holocaust). Having kids is considered more or less a fundamental human right by a large portion of the population, hence why criminals and the mentally handicapped aren't sterilized (anymore). \n\nBasically, while there could be some health benefits to such a program, it would very rapidly become a political minefield. \n\nAlso, sidenote: genetic diseases are much, much, much more common, and also much harder to define, than you would think. Damn near everyone has a genetic predisposition to some diseases, so drawing the line between \"allowed to reproduce\" and \"not allowed\" would be very tricky. ",
                "In other words: \"Does eugenics works?\"\n\nThe nazis tried to test that but the got distracted kill jews and other people they considered \"unfit\".\n\nSince yhen we can't even touch the subject. \n\nBut I guess that it probably would work in some extent. \n\nThe problem is who to decides if some can or cannot reproduce and which criteria use.",
                "Obviously we could improve our collective genetics by filtering out unwanted traits, but 1. Many of these flaws are not hereditary so you can't breed them out and 2. Many people suffering from certain flaws weren't going to reproduce anyway (severe mental of physical handicaps for example). It would work, but there would still be a lot of conditions that couldn't be avoided because they are more or less random. The only way we could totally avoid genetic defects would be to step into the reproductive process and select only \"pure\" fetuses, or to manipulate the DNA.",
                "I don't think it would be good for the species overall. Maybe we could breed out a few genetic diseases, but we would also lose some of the genetic diversity that makes us resistant to other disease, for example, how sickle cell anemia makes some people resistant to malaria. It's difficult to know where to draw the line when genetic traits that are harmful in some environments can be advantageous in others. And the fact that trying to enforce a eugenics program on people would be far more damaging to human lives than disease. ",
                "Oh my sweet summer child.\n\nShort answer: Probably not.\n\nLonger answer: I mean, we might be able to tamper with genetics enough but we wouldn't want to.\n\nDetailed explanation...\n\nEvolution favors diversity. If you breed humans for a selective end, even if it seems like an obvious benefit, you hurt human ability to adapt in the future. Think of the Shih Tzu. This snub nosed runt has been bread so far apart from most dogs that its existence is dependent on humans. Its breeding is now too extreme and it would be incapable of survival if humans went away. Now, obviously, in your question we wouldn't tamper with humans to this extreme, but we would still be making humans a weaker species and one less equipped to meet a wide diversity of challenges. \n\nWhen it comes to physically/mentally disabled, blind, susceptible to disease you ignore one BIG thing... that shit still happens in nature. In environments where it's still expected for your cause of death to be being eaten, deaf, dumb, blind and gimpy critters are still born. You don't usually see them because, nature. These physical problems are mutations. They might not manifest right away, and they might not even become physical problems until the environment changes. Disease is separate from the general biological functionality. You cant breed out fetal alcohol syndrome, at best you could breed out pleasure from alcohol, but that in and of itself could have bad consequences. \n\nA good example of this the genetic predisposition for some disease. When all we had was nuts and berries, a subtle mutation which would make diabetes more likely didn't really pose a positive or negative until there was enough food for it to be a problem. Inversely, leprosy has all but been eliminated because it's almost killed everybody who's susceptible to the disease. Other problems, like macular degeneration, dependency on vitamins and aging are simply consequence of living and won't likely go away with heavy genetic modification.\n\nHumans breeds would make for an interesting experiment. Many people already falsely equate race to breeds but there simply isn't enough diversity for this to be equivocal. Full human breeding on this scale would look more like Eloi and Morlocks; the end product would take a long ass time and result in something only adapted to specific living conditions. Ultimately though, even if we ignore ethics/morality, there's a huge \"why would we do this?\" We could spend less and do more mapping human genetics and simulating multiple generations of change with a well designed computer model. Best yet, we wouldn't have to feed it. ",
                "As others have mentioned, you *might* be able to get rid of a few diseases, but you could increase the frequency of other problems by limiting the overall gene pool.  If you remove anyone with a genetic defect at each generation, the gene pool will become eventually become so sparse humanity could end up looking like [Charles II of Spain](_URL_0_).\n\nThe other thing that you wouldn't be able to control would be spontaneous mutation.  The human genome accumulates [1 - 2 new mutations per generation](_URL_1_), so you would still run into issues where a \"clean\" genetic line could become unusable after a time.\n\ntl;dr:  Hard to tell, but selective breeding in humans hasn't worked well in the past:  [Charles II of Spain](_URL_0_)",
                " > On the other side, humans if you can get someone to agree anyone can reproduce no matter the genetics. If we as a race opted to only let those with no physical problems, no disease and mental illness reproduce would we see a marked health in the human population as a whole or are outside factors (eating too much and getting adult onset diabetes, being exposed to viruses, etc) too prevalent a factor to prevent any marked change?\n\n\nThere's one huge problem with this: how do you know that those \"physical problems, diseases, and mental illnesses\" aren't actually a benefit?\n\nSickle-Cell anemia is a genetic disease that can cause serious problems for the people who have it; but it also provides resistence to malaria. ADD and ADHD are mental disorders that are huge advantages in certain professions. Autism spectrum disorders are also highly correlated with high levels of intelligence in specific areas. People who live with diseases are likely to have resistence to those diseases, either developed or genetic. The list goes on, and on, and on.\n\n\nBasically, what you would likely see is a short-term increase in human health, measured in 1-3 generations; followed by a significant decrease in average human health *and achievement* as the \"defects\" removed from the genetic diversity of humanity also took away certain advantages that came with them."

                "The terms duke and count come from Latin, and originate as military titles (dux and comes, respectively).  I know a lot more about the evolutional of ducal titles so I'll focus on that, but from the medieval period on they are functionally the same, just on a different scale.  In the late Imperial period, the title of dux was linked with a province, and signified the highest military authority in the province, eventually being able to act independently even of the governor of their province.  With the Germanic migrations and the erosion of the Roman empire, the Roman provinces at first largely retained their borders, and the titles continued to be used; Henri Pirenne, in Mohammed and Charlemagne, argues that the Germanic rulers saw themselves as a continuation, rather than replacement, of the Roman empire, even after their practical and official fealty to Rome ended.  The duces of Germanic western Europe were also landowners, and this, in combination with the military power they held by virtue of their title, meant that they soon became the de facto and then de jure authority over the land their title corresponded to.\n\nIn the early medieval period, the majority of nobles in Europe lived in the territories they held.  Over the next thousand or so years, the consolidation of titles by noble families, through marriage, bequethment by sovereigns, and military conquest, meant that one person could hold a collection of titles to lands theoretically all over Europe.  This caused a number of problems, a notable example being the Norman kings of England, who, having first held, and continuing to do so after the conquest, the title of Duke of Normandy, were legally vassals of the French king, a situation that lead to centuries of political and often military conflict.  Another result was that these nobles had to either choose one of their domains to rule from, or travel constantly between all their holdings.  In situations where this was not tenable in the longer term, many nobles would divide their distant holdings among a collection of heirs in their will, or bequeath some of their holdings to vassals to rule in their name during their own lifetime, so that they could be ruled by a lord residing locally, a situation that was noted later by Machiavelli in the Prince to contribute greatly to stability, and be much more likely to result in the continuation of control over that domain.  Another solution was to grant a family member the authority to rule a fief in the lord's name without transferring the title; this could be dangerous, as an ambitious and unscrupulous person could attempt to usurp that domain for themselves, or at least use their authority to enrich themselves while withholding the fruits of the fief from its titular lord.\n\nAs the Germanic kingdoms of Western Europe evolved, the kings, originally elected by the dukes from among their number, became hereditary.  At the same time, the system of feudalism was evolving into what we think of today when we hear the term.  A noble ruled a portion of a kingdom in the king's name, earning for themselves the bulk of the profits those lands produced, and in return, owed military service in the form of a certain number of soldiers for a certain period of time per year.\n\nHigher titles (duke was usually the highest title under the monarch, with count below that, and baron below that) usually came with larger fiefs, which were often divided into smaller domains; so, for instance, a duchy might be divided into a small collection of counties and baronies, with some of those counties possibly being partially made up of baronies themselves, and only a part of the land being directly under administration by the duke himself.  The less of their land the duke was directly responsible for, the easier it was to hold that domain in absentia, as subordinate lords who were present themselves could maintain stability within their own fiefs, and if they owed military service to their lord as part of their vassalage, be called upon to suppress any uprisings in the higher lord's own direct holdings.\n\nEven in the late medieval and into the early modern period, many lords resided in their holdings; the Sforza Dukes of Milan are examples.  In England though, most titles have become largely symbolic; the Prince of Wales, for instance, has been since the 13th century the title held by the English heir apparent.  As titles have lost their civic roles, the importance of residing in the associated fiefdom has completely disappeared.\n\nPlease forgive any spelling errors; I wrote this on a smartphone touchscreen.\n\nEdit: I always wondered back when I read those books, with all the intermarriages and houses being wiped out, how every lord held exactly one land-bearing title and no family had more than one branch.\n\nEdit 2: if I recall correctly, 'earl' is the English equivalent of continental 'count'.  Earl comes from Nordic jarl, a title used in Scandinavia, and by extension, in Britain during the Danelaw and the Viking domains in England, Scotland, and Ireland.  Perhaps someone else can elaborate on how earl came to be a subordinate title to duke, a title which gained its Germanic feudal connotations in Britain under the Normans."

                "In short answer, recent researchers has increasing found difficulty in defining the 'Hanseatic League' (OK for its use, I suppose) as a unified polity except for the relatively short period in late 14th and early 15th century, the 'Golden Age' of the Hanseatic League. Some revisionist scholars even argue that there was no 'Hanseatic League' until the middle of the 14th century, in contrast to the classic image of the early pioneering commercial activity of the German merchants in the Baltic Sea in the late 12th and 13th century. \n\nPart of this trend came from the revaluation of the central organization of the League, Hanseatic Diet (*Hansetag*): This was assemblies of the towns' representatives that could issued a shared regulations on the member towns as well as even could sometimes take an unified action against the possible external threat like the king of Denmark (1360s and 1410s), but the definition of this kind of membership itself was rather very ill-defined. There seemed to be no obligation for a town to send the representative in the Diet, so it is not so always easy to calculate how many towns actually joined in the League in a certain time like ca. 1450. According to a revisionist view of point, the Diet, i.e. the basic organization of the 'Hanseatic League' was anything but loose aggregates of towns under the influence of some leading towns like Lübeck (until 15th century) and Hamburg (16th century onward), based on the shared interest at that time. \n\nIn other words, taking this 'institutional' principle of the Hanseatic League in consideration, OP's original question means that: 'How independent were this kind of leading towns like Lübeck or Hamburg from HRE or other neighboring powers?' From this point of view, the middle of the 13th century (or 1220s/ 1230s) might be a turning point of 'Hanseatic' history when some towns like Lübeck began to act as an somewhat independent polity and to conclude a treaty with other territorial princes in Low countries or in Germany, or rulers of European kingdoms. AFAIK few HRE ruler had any concrete policy in the Baltic Sea in the Middle Ages, so generally they acted on their own until ca. 1500, I suppose.  \n\nReferences:  \n\n* Harreld, Donald J. *A Companion to the Hanseatic League.* Leiden: Brill, 2015. \n* Nicholas, David. *The Northern Lands: Germanic Europe, c. 1270-c. 1500*.

The company I bought the product from refused to do anything anout it or wouldn't even talk to me.\"  I won't do business with a company rhat makes me gamble on their product. Everyone makes mistakes, if refusing to fix them is part of your business model, then I'll take my money elsewhere.",

                "Humans rely mostly on their subconscious when making decisions under uncertainty. We use several subconscious strategies to do so: anchoring, availability/relevance and representativeness. In the case of shopping, relevance and representativeness are the main two. You want to know that an item will be useful in your life (relevance), and what others have to say that represents that item.\n\n\n\n These strategies are guided by our biases. Being a person who prefers not to lose (loss averse) appears to be the leading bias here. You are afraid of losing the resources from buying an item that ends up not being worth it. We are also social animals, who will follow the cues of other humans. Seeing a handful of people who \"lost\" with the product might deter a great amount of people from buying it, even if the statistical amount of people who got what they wanted was much greater. \n\n\n\nTo help solidify my point, doctors tend to word procedures in terms of success, rather than failure for this very reason. Do you think people would rather hear that a surgery has a 90% success rate? Or a 10% death rate? Getting someone to become more aware of the faults of something leans them towards their loss aversion bias, and negative reviews do just that. ",

                "A note to my readers: Given the nature of the text in question, there is sexually explicit material in my explanation.\n\nThe Victorians focused much more on the perceived Biblical connections of the Epic of Gilgamesh, and many Victorian-era translations either romanticized or skipped the sexual scenes completely. (I should note that I study the Victorian period, and my knowledge of Assyria, its culture, and its literature is hazy at best.)\n\nIn 1849, British archaeologist Austen Henry Layard and his assistant Hormuzd Rassam started excavating Nineveh. In 1853, Rassam excavated the palace of Ashurbanipal, finding thousands of fired clay tablets gathered by the king. Among them were the broken tablets that contained the Epic of Gilgamesh, but this wouldn't be discovered for decades. 1853 is also notable for being the year Sir Henry Rawlinson succeeded in deciphering cuneiform, using in large part a three-language inscription from Darius the Great known as the Behistun inscription. (An interesting and revealing side-story: Rawlinson describes having to balance ladders on very narrow lips of rock and then stand on the very top rung to copy down the text. When there was a passage the ladders could not reach and none of the British dared climb, Rawlinson did a very Victorian British thing: he hired a Kurdish boy to climb up, gripping with his fingers and toes, and take a rubbing, promising him \"a considerable reward if he succeeded.\") \n\nThe first person to translate a part of the Epic of Gilgamesh was a young British scholar named George Smith. Smith, who had left school at age 14 to work at a printer's, was fascinated by Assyria, and starting in 1860 visited the British Museum to learn all he could. When they noticed his obsession, the museum hired him to piece together the broken tablets, and it was he who first realized that some of the tablets contained the Gilgamesh epic. While working on the tablets, Smith discovered the story of the flood and the ship that ended up on a mountain and made a connection to the Biblical story. In 1872, he gave a talk to the museum in which he associated the flood story with Noah's flood, titling the talk \"The Chaldean History of the Flood.\" In the language used to write Gilgamesh, Akkadian often mixed with the older Sumerian, which Akkadian scribes also learned. A character pronounced one way in Akkadian would be pronounced entirely differently in Sumerian. This was why Smith's translation gave Gilgamesh's name as Izdubar (the latter would be the pronunciation if the symbols were Akkadian). Enkidu became Heabani. Smith argued that Gilgamesh is the hunter-king Nimrod who appears in the Bible. But what about all the sex that would surely have left Victorians outraged? There's no sign of it in Smith's early translation: at this point, he was only interested in Biblical connections. For example, of the whole incident with Ishtar and the monstrous bull, Smith only writes \"and then an animal called 'the divine bull' was subdued.\" He would also describe what he saw as the Assyrian depictions of heaven, hell, and the immortal soul. \n\nBut don't worry. In 1875, Smith published a much fuller version, *The Chaldean Account of Genesis,* which sold well. He purposely left out some of the more explicit scenes, such as Enkidu's (sorry... Heabani's) seduction by the \"temple harlot,\" claiming he did so \"because they were on the one side obscure, and on the other hand appeared hardly adapted for general reading.\" I can't think of a more Victorian dodge than that. There are also several errors in translation: instead of the famous wrestling scene between Gilgamesh and Enkidu, Izdubar wrestles a tiger Heabani brings with him, and Izdubar, not Heabani, is struck down by disease after they kill the giant bull, which makes Heabani's death something of a mystery. (The tiger is a mistranslation from text that had been written across two tablets: the \"Midannu\" beast turns out, when the tablets are connected, to be \"anakumi dannu,\" a boast by Enkidu: \"I alone am mighty.\") Smith also takes stories about Ishtar from other sources, including her descent into the underworld, using other Ishtar depictions to gloss over the defiant and scandalous ways Gilgamesh insults Ishtar as he rebuffs her sexual advances towards him. As you might imagine from Smith's framing, reviewers talked almost exclusively about the Biblical connections of Smith's translation, praising their usefulness in helping better understand Biblical stories.\n\nThe first popular translation was written by the fantastically-named  Leonidas Le Cenci Hamilton, an American, in 1884. His book, *Ishtar and Izdubar, The Epic of Babylon* turns the story into a sweet romance. Hamilton's adaptation is very loose, transforming the poem into couplets that are sometimes tortured into having the right end rhyme. In Hamilton's poem, Heabani chases the \"maiden\" sent to \"entice\" him, who playfully always slips out of his grasp: \"But he the sport enjoys, and her pursues; / But glancing back his arms she doth refuse.  /And thus three days and four of nights she played; / For of Heabani's love she was afraid. / Her joyous company doth him inspire / For Sam-kha, joy, and love, and wild desire. / He was not satisfied unless her form / Remained before him with her endless charm.\" Later, another maiden appears, and Heabani sits wistfully at her feet admiring her: \"And when Heabani saw the rounded form / Of bright Kharim-tu, her voluptuous charm / Drew him to her, and at her feet he sate / With wistful face, resigned to any fate.\" Regarding the scenes with Ishtar, the poem describes that her \"love\" for men and animals withers them away, but is vague on what that entails. Hamilton takes Ishtar's \"descent to Hades\" to return her lover Tammuz to life from a completely different poem (the \"Descent of Innana\"), and the connection to Greek mythology is clear. As for the death of Heabani, the seer receives his death-blow in a fight with dragons: even as Izdubar strikes down the dragon, the beast sinks its fangs into Heabani. After his long mourning for his friend, Izdubar finds sweet love in the arms of a princess, Mua. The story ends with Izdubar preparing to return from paradise to the world of men, making his tragic farewell to Mua, who chooses to remain ignorant of death in paradise rather than to come with him to a world of mortality and woe. In a second volume that was never written, Izdubar was supposed to eventually find immortality and reconcile with Ishtar. Interestingly, given the other translations around this time, Hamilton leaves out the flood completely. Hamilton's version was rendered obsolete almost immediately by more accurate and complete German translations. He was forced to file for bankruptcy, and died of stomach cancer in 1906. I haven't been able to find any contemporary reviews."

                "Let's put something real to this example. We'll choose Carbon-11. \n\nCarbon-11 is a radioactive isotope with a half life of 20 minutes. It decays by positron emission - that is, a proton is converted to a neutron and a positron is ejected from the nucleus. This converts the Carbon-11 to a much more stable Boron-11. So, if you sat and watched a 100 gram pile of Carbon-11 for roughly 5.5 hours, you would be left with only 0.001 grams of Carbon-11\n\nIt wouldn't \"disappear\", though. It is just converted to a different, more stable element. \n\n\n",
                "If we disregard the energy released during decay, then it depends on what the original and final atoms are.  If both exist in the solid phase at standard conditions, you wouldn't notice much.  If the product existed in the gaseous phase (like radon), then you would likely observe the original sample convert to a gas.\n\nHowever, *realistically*, a cubic meter of something decaying that fast is going to release an enormous amount of energy.  With a half life of 10 seconds, roughly 7% of the atoms present are decaying every second.  If we consider a [cubic meter of carbon 14](_URL_0_) (10^29 ) which emits 0.156 MeV per decay, at that decay rate your block would be putting out 2.5 x 10^15 watts (or roughly 400 times total human power consumption)."

That's ALL living things (people, fish, birds, trees, bacteria, flies, flowers, etc.)\n\nThe ocean contains approximately 1,450,000,000,000,000,000 tons of ocean water.  That's not 1.4 billion, or trillion, or quadrillion... but Quintillion.  1.45 Quintillion tons.  That's 1,450,000,000 billion.  That's so many orders of magnitute greater, that the amount of pee present is, to coin a phrase, \"A drop in the ocean\".\n\nSources:\n_URL_5_\n_URL_2_\n_URL_6_\n_URL_3_\n_URL_0_\n_URL_1_\n_URL_4_\n\nYAY OCEAN!\n\nEdit: moved to top level comment instead of reply\n\nEdit 2: Wow Thanks for the silver!\n\nEdit 3: WOW WOW Thanks SO much for the Gold!

Since air resistance isn't a factor you've made answering this easier. For the acceleration we'll use 2ms^(-2).\n\nSo is F=ma then force = mass x acceleration.\n\nLighter cyclist:\n\nF=ma\nF=50 x 2\nF=100N\n\nHeavier cyclist:\n\nF=ma\nF=100 x 2\nF=200N\n\nSo now that we have our force worked out we can carry on to complete the work done calculations.

Of course this only happens when both accelerations are exactly the same, which is unlikely.",
                "You are right in that the heavier cyclist would have performed twice the work against gravity, i.e. raised their gravitational potential energy twice as much (W = mgh). But the heavier cyclist would effectively do more work due to having to do more work against friction and drag. He also spends more energy pedalling as he has heavier legs.\n\n >  And what is the appropriate measurement for that? Watt hours?\n\nYou can measure work (and heat and energy) in many ways. Joule, Newton meters, Watt hours, Coulomb Volts etc. With mechanical work, such as cyclists riding up a hill, I would use Newton meters or Joule.\n\nEDIT: To reply to the most prominent follow-up comments:\n\n**you didn't account for the weight of the bicycle**\n\nI included the weight of the bicycle as well as the clothes, helmet and other carried items/accessories in the cyclist. If we only count the weight of the cyclist, the heavier one would do a little less work against gravity.\n\n**leg weight is not a factor**\n\nWhile leg weight doesn't contribute to any work against gravity. You do have to push with your legs to apply force to the pedals, and to make your legs move you have to overcome their inertia which is proportional to their mass.\n\nI cite an [example I made earlier](_URL_0_):\n\n >  Imagine if you are on a stationary exercise bicycle with no resistance and had to carry a certain amount of weight. If you carried that weight in a back pack it would make almost no difference, but if the weight were strapped on your feet it would make it harder to pedal as it would increase the inertia of your feet.\n",
                "The science above sounded correct, bit I'm just wondering : if they're on identical bikes, legs call them 10kgs, is it not 110kgs the fat guy has to get up the hill versus 60kg for the skinny guy? This not being 'double' at all? The hike has to get up too, and part of your force drives you and the bike as a system ",
                "If the problem is reduced to the ideal case - no air resistance, weightless bikes with frictionless drivetrains, inflexible wheels with no slippage, then yes, the heavier rider will have done twice the work.\n\nYou can see in all the other answers that there are a lot of other factors (air resistance, bike weight, tire flex, etc.) that can be added to the equation to get a more precise answer.",
                "A possibility that no one has mentioned here yet is that there is both:\n\n1. A point that the effort will be precisely equal to double\n\n2. A point that the effort will not be precisely equal to double.\n\nWithin the physical structure there can be many different amounts of 'effort' being placed with angles/weights/momentum of arms and legs. So let us assume that both cyclists are identical in everything except weight. Distributed identically.\n\nFor all sizes of rider (from microscopic to infinite) there exists a scale of how much effort is applied to the bike. There also exists a point on this scale that represents the most efficient power to weight ratio. \n\nIf you can place the weights of both riders equidistant on either side of that point of perfect ratio, then you could find exactly double the energy used.\n\nSo, do OP's 50kg and 100kg example weights represent this? Unknown, but also not really relevant. As there is also a selection of cycling styles (stand up, sit down, apply max on down pedal only, shift weight from foot to foot, etc...) that both cyclists can use. Even assuming identical styles, it stands to reason that 2 weights that do not produce double effort, could be made to by changing cycling styles as they manipulate acceleration, friction and inertia differently. And it is those physical forces that will mostly regulate the rates of changes near the point of exactly double effort. ",
                "Like many answers below, (assuming massless bicycles) the 100 kg cyclist will have created exactly twice as much potential energy by increasing the distance from the Earth's centrer of mass, but not exactly twice as much heat from air friction and air carrying away heat from their muscles.

With a rider weighing twice as much the difference is significant.\n\nThe difference in bearing and chain loss are very small.\n\nThe dominant factor is potential energy (mgh) so yes twice the energy but not exactly.",
                "The work output of the heavier rider will be 2x the lighter rider, however the work input is not necessarily the same ratio. The two riders are probably not equally efficient at converting stored energy into useful work. \n\nAnother way to think about it is to have two riders the same size on the same bikes. One rider is an elite cyclist the other rider is an amateur. \n\nThe elite cyclist will spend less energy to perform the same amount of work as the amateur because his trained body is more efficient at converting stored energy into work output. The total useful work done is the same, but the energy spent achieving that work is not the same. ",
                "You are correct in that the heavier rider will have to do double the work in terms of potial energy difference.  However the difference in power output would not be double because of the other sources of drag.  \n\nWhen riding a bike a very high percentage of the work being done is to overcome aerodynamic drag, on a flat road this can be as high as 80%.  So assuming that frontal area is the same, and things such as rolling resistance remain the same, and are relatively small.  The heavier rider would be doing 20% more work.\n\nObviously this is a very simplified case and I would need some paper to come up with a proper in depth answer but the idea is the same.  To measure the power use Watts (J/s) for work use Joules.\n\nTl:Dr: the work would not double because of larger sources of drag in the system ",
                "Not at all. You are forgetting that the mass of the bike is included in the problem. Let's say the bike is 10kg, then your two riders will have to increase the gravitational energy of them and the bike together, effectively working against 60kg and 110kg.\n\nThe other problem is resistance against the road, which is different from air resistance. Newton's 3rd law states that every action has an equal and opposite reaction (but be careful interpreting this). This means that when your bike is sitting on the road, it is applying a force to the road. The road applies **exactly the same force** back on the bike to stop it sinking into the road. This force is at right angles to the road (perpendicular), so it is also what is responsible for pushing you down the hill. It is called the Normal Reaction Force (becase normal and perpendicular are the same thing in maths). Friction can be simplified to a fraction of this force in the equation F = uR (the u is actually a greek letter), so this means that an object with a higher reaction force experiences more friction when moving along the surface. \"u\" is different for different surfaces.\n\nThe upshot of this is that your heavier rider will have more friction on the road.\n\nTo increase their potential energy, both riders will have to do work towards that energy, but will also be doing work against friction (which is lost as heat and sound). Calculating the work against friction is very simple. You take the frictional force \"F\" (from the equation earlier) and multiply it by the distance that force acted in (the distance your riders covered). From this you get the exact amount of energy required to overcome that force.\n\nSo in short, the heavier rider will do less than twice of the smaller to work against the weight of the bike, but more work than the smaller against friction.",
                "If we are talking about pure physics here, then yes, twice the weight equals twice the work (energy). It's easy to see from the potential energy formula many people provided here: E=mgh. There is only one extra condition that must be satisfied though: **both riders must be going with the same speed**. Otherwise, according to the kinetic energy formula K=mv^(2)/2 the faster rider will have to spend more energy.\n\nNow, if we are talking about human bodies, then the proportion is kind of skewed as a person's metabolic rate effects the outcome. According to many studies, heavier individuals spend more energy that lighter ones doing identical work, even laying down motionless (bodily functions as breathing, blood pumping, heat production, etc. take greater amount of energy for heavier bodies). So, I would assume that a real 100kg person would have to spend **more than twice the energy** of the 50kg one climbing uphill the same distance and with the same speed.     ",
                "The amount of work that the cyclists perform is not how hard they are working but the summation of the force exerted on the pedals over the distance the pedals turned. Our bodies exert more work to do work than we transfer. We burn calories and exert energy/work simply holding ourselves steady, balancing, etc.\n\nGiven that its the work transferred to the pedals what is the ration of the work the light cyclist did versus the heavy one? The bike obviously matters. Also lets assume they transfer work to potential energy of the hill at 70% each irrespective of the fact that the heavy rider is transferring more.  If both bikes are 10kgs the total mgh of each rider at the top of the hill is gh*(50+10) and gh*(100+10). As each rider only transferred 70% of their work to the hill the ration remains the same at 110/60.  The lighter rider had to pedal a proportionally heavier bike up the hill so the ratio is not 2:1\n\nOther factors are open to speculation but a heavy rider is not going to naturally be less aerodynamic or efficient at riding a bike than a light rider. ",
                "This is really easy. Work = Energy. In this case the energy changed is Potential. mass times acceleration times height since we are working with a change in gravitational potential energy.\n\nYou just take the mass of the bike rider and multiply by the acceration of gravity times the height of the hill (all in the same units.) It's not exactly double because you have to factor in the mass of the bike plus the rider. However if the bike is very very light compared to the rider you can ignore it and get a rough number. In this case, yes twice the work. However to be accurate you have to factor in the mass of the bike since it's probably about 10-15% of the rider weight. \n\nYou can also ignore all the other issues unless they are traveling at a speed where the air resistance starts to matter, but even assuming \"fat\" rider vs. a \"skinny\" rider, the difference in cross sectional area is also going to be very very small. Again, maybe 10%. When you factor in the speed at which they are riding it's irrelevent. At a slow speed the \"fat\" rider could have a parachute behind him and it would not make any difference. :-)",
                "This being the case the next question is: \"what factor(s) counter the advantages of lower body weight when cycling resulting in an optimum weight that is above the minimum weight possible for a live human?\". Bradley Wiggins is 77 kg"

Since there's only one right answer, the number of wrong answers is 2^n  - 1. Quantum mechanics can give you a \"state\" that's a \"superposition\" of the correct and all the wrong answers. Since there are so many more wrong answers, your chance of getting the right answer if you measure is extremely small. So we need to move the state closer to the right answer.\n\nNow consider a normal clock. Ignore everything between 3 and noon. 3 o clock is the wrong answers and noon is the right answer. Initially your state is almost all wrong answers and therefore very close to 3.  There's no way you're going to understand the math, but what you can do is the following:\n\nConsider where you start on the clock s. For simplicity let's say it's at 2.59 o clock. Now you can flip the state around the set of bad answers, which sets your state at 3.01 o clock. That seems to do you no good and just move you further away from the right answer. But it turns out you can flip back around s which gives you 2.57 o clock. Next round will be 2.57 - >  3.03 - >  2.51 and so on. After enough rounds you'll get close to noon. \n\nThere's a picture on wikipedia that shows it : _URL_0_\n\n|s' >  is all the wrong answers\n\n|w >  is the right answer.\n\n|s >  is the current state\n\nU_w is step one\n\nU_s is step two\n\nedit: If you didn't fully understand that, remember you're a highschool student and about half of students on 4th year of university manage to fuck it up.
