                "There certainly did exist an Islamic underworld which offered access to forbidden fruits, though few if any of our sources for it date to this early in the Muslim period. If we move a couple of hundred years later, however, we can begin to find references to a company of rogues and criminals known as the Banu Sasan in a scattering of Islamic texts from *maqamat* ~~(popular)~~ literature. \n\nOne of the best known was Abu Dulaf al-Khazraji, a self-proclaimed king of vagabonds more often noted as the author of a text apparently describing a 10th century Samanid embassy to China, who secured a tenuous position among the entourage of a vizier of Isfahan, Ibn Abbad, by telling sordid, titillating, tales of the underworld.\n\n“I am of the company of beggar lords,” Abu Dulaf boasts in one account,\n\n > The cofraternity of the outstanding ones,\n\n > One of the Banu Sasan…\n\n > And the sweetest way of life we have experienced \n\n > Is one spent in sexual indulgence and wine drinking.\n\n > For we are the lads, the only lads who really matter, on land and sea.\n\nOf course, that reads better in the original Persian...\n\nOur sources are united in suggesting that a large proportion of the Banu Sasan were Kurds, a people seen by other Middle Eastern peoples as brigands and predators. They also show that the criminal slang they employed drew on a wide variety of languages. Much of it has its origins in what Johann Fück has termed “Middle Arabic,” but the remainder seems to be derived from everything from Byzantine Greek to Persian, Hebrew and Syriac.\n\nUltimately, however, what strikes one most about the Banu Sasan is their remarkable inclusiveness. At one extreme lie the men of violence; ar-Raghib al-Isfahani lists five separate categories of thug, from the housebreaker to out-and-out killers such as the *sahib ba’j*, the “disemboweler and ripper-open of bellies,” and the *sahib radkh*, the “crusher and pounder” who accompanies lone travellers on their journeys and then, when his victim has prostrated himself in prayer, “creeps up and hits him simultaneously over the head with two smooth stones.” But at the other lie the poets, among them the mysterious Al-Ukbari—of whom we are told little more than that he was “the poet of rogues, their elegant exponent and the wittiest of them all.”\n\nSadly, from the point of view of this query, the majority of the literature dealing with the Banu Sasen (most importantly the *Kashf al-asrar*, an obscure work by the Syrian writer Jaubari that dates to around 1235, and translates as *Unveiling of Secrets*) is fairly practical, and is devoted to setting out the various (often quite remarkable) crimes they committed, so that the reader could avoid being rooked by them – not to the details of their debauches. If this sort of thing is of any interest, I wrote about it in considerable detail (with more sources), [here](_URL_0_).",
                "Ok, two things first: To answer this I fear I have to cheat a little and extent the time period that you’re asking about by a few decades into the time of the Umayyad Caliphate. I think we simply don’t really have enough information about the earliest times of the Caliphate under the rule of the Rashidun to paint a lively picture. This also moves the geographical area away from Medina and the Hejaz to the north into the steppes of Greater Syria from where the Umayyad clan ruled their continent spanning empire.\n\nSecond, I think I may have a bit of a surprise for you when it comes to the attitudes people in the early Caliphate had towards the drinking of whine and debauchery as a hole. When modern people, muslim and non muslim alike, think about the early times of the Caliphate they normally imagine a society that is tightly regulated by the norms of the Sharia. However although those norms certainly are based on guidelines that were already laid down in the times of the Prophet and the Rashidun Caliphs they weren’t really codified into law yet so to speak. Back then the formative years of islamic law that saw the establishment of the great law schools of the Hanfis, Malikis, Shafi’i`s and Hanbalis lay still in the future. That means when it came to the question whether it was allowed to drink alcohol or not all that early Muslims had to guide them were the verses of the Quran and the remembered attitudes of Mohammed. And those could be quite contradictory. Some verses are quite clear in their condemnation of alcohol:\n\n >  O ye who believe! Strong drink and games of chance and idols and divining arrows are only an infamy of Satan's handiwork. Leave it aside in order that ye may succeed. (5,90)\n\nBut then another verse has this to say:\n\n >  O ye who believe! Draw not near unto prayer when ye are drunken, till ye know that which ye utter, nor when ye are polluted, save when journeying upon the road, till ye have bathed. (4,43)\n\nHere it seems that drunkenness isn’t totally forbidden or it wouldn’t be necessary to clarify that you can’t be drunken when you want to pray. Another verse even seems to praise the drinking of wine:\n\n >  And of the fruits of the date-palm, and grapes, whence ye derive strong drink and (also) good nourishment. Lo! therein is indeed a portent for people who have sense. (6,67)\n\nNow as I said, in later times those contradictory comments would be translated into a more (although still not totally) coherent set of laws by the great islamic law schools. But we would be wise not to project those later attitudes on earlier times. So while the drinking of alcohol was certainly frowned upon by more rigorous characters it wasn’t necessarily forbidden in Umayyad times.\n\nWith that out of the way we can turn to the Umayyads themselves. They were the family that monopolized the office of the Caliphate for themselves from the end of the Rashidun until they were overthrown by a rival dynasty, the Abbasids, in 750 AD. Under their rule the center of the Caliphate shifted from the Hejaz to Syria in the north where they already had been able to build a strong power base. Here they developed a sophisticated court culture that mixed elements from pre islamic Arabia with those from the Late Antique Roman and Persian Empires which they had recently conquered. The most striking witnesses to this new elite culture were the so called ‘desert palaces’ which the members of the Umayyad aristocracy build in the steppes of Greater Syria. Their still impressive ruins can today be visited in the modern states of Syria, Libanon, Jordan and the Palestinian territories.\n\nOne example from Jordan would be small palace of Qusayr Amra in modern Jordan. It is relatively [modest in size](_URL_0_) but contains a really marvelous set of frescoes. The main building seems to combine the function of throne room and bath house. In it we find scenes that are familiar from Late Roman and Persian court culture like [hunting scenes](_URL_1_) or a ruler on his throne. And as is fitting for a bath house we also see quite a few [nude figures](_URL_3_), most of them [women](_URL_4_). Similar depictions are known from other desert castles like [this](_URL_2_) stucco statue from Khirbat al Mafjar in Palestine. It’s probably safe to assume that they’re more or less representative of the real debauchery that could be found in those aristocratic palaces. \n\nLiterary sources that tell about the Umayyads often seem to confirm this picture. In his book *Walid and his friends. An Umayyad Tragedy* (1988) Robert Hamilton relates a story from the *Khitab al Aghani* (book of songs) from the 10th century about the poet Abu Harun Utarrad who is invited to the palace of Caliph Al Walid II. He is summoned to the bath house where the ruler awaits him sitting at the edge of a bathtub filled with wine. The Caliph listens to the poet’s songs and afterward he strips off his precious garment, climbs into the tub and doesn’t come out of it until the level of wine is lowered significantly. After leaving the tub he immediately passes out so that the poet is able to steal away with the Caliph’s garment. The same scene repeats at the next evening but at the third day the poet is instead summoned to the throne room. Al Walid tells him that he can leave the palace and go his merry way but only under the condition that he will never tell anybody what he has witnessed here. Luckily for the poet only a few years later the Umayyad dynasty would be overthrown by the Abbasids so that he could freely talk about his experience.\n\nNow stories like this should certainly be taken with more than a grain of salt. After all it was probably quite fashionable to discredit the Umayyads for their sinful lifestyle after the dynasty had lost power and their adversaries had taken control over the Caliphate. But the sumptuous decoration of the Desert Castles strongly implies that they were at least partially based in truth. And not all members of the Umayyad family seem to have been as fond of wine as Al Walid may have been, who earned a reputation as an almost legendary drunkard. His uncle and predecessor Hisham reportedly abstained from drinking wine at all and even scolded his nephew for his debauchery. But then again Hisham himself was also quite famously fond of women and music. \n\nSo we can certainly say that for a member of the Arab elite there were quite a few avenues for vice and wanton pleasure to be had in early islamic times. But they weren’t at all restricted to a glitzy underworld but an integral feature of the court culture of the time. And although I’m not at all an expert on the later islamic Middle Ages I know of a few depictions of later muslim rulers drinking wine that seem to strongly suggest that the Umayyads weren’t the last ones to live this kind of life."

                "Per Wikipedia: \n >  A short circuit...is an electrical circuit that allows a current to travel along an unintended path, often where essentially no (or a very low) electrical impedance is encountered.\n\nAs other users have pointed out, the body does not use the same mechanisms to create a current that electronics use. While it is true that current comes about from the movement of charges particles (classically, the movement of electrons; though, the reality is the opposite case), neurons, neuron fibers, and muscle fibers do not \"push\" these charged particles from one end to the another. The charged particles accomplishing this task in the body are, of course, ions; mainly Potassium, Sodium, Chloride, and Calcium ions. \n\nThe mechanism of current production can get a bit messy in neurons and cells, but the TL;DR of the process is that a current is generated in these cells when there is a net movement of ions *perpendicular, across the cell membrane* that pushes the cell to a certain threshold voltage (either towards the positive or the negative...if you want more detail on this, please ask). This change in what is termed \"membrane potential\" happens locally in a single given spot and, if strong enough, can induce a change in membrane potential in a consecutive spot. The change in potential propagates down the cell (an event that is termed as the propagation of the Action Potential) and eventually reaches the end of it (in the case of the neuron, the change in potential propagates down the axon, and reaches the synapse, where a signal is sent to another neuron/muscle). Herein lies the difference between the \"electric\" cells of the body and the electronic components of a computer. In the body, current flow is generated by moving ions *perpendicularly* across cell membranes; whereas in wires, current is generated by pushing  electrons in a *parallel* fashion from one end to the other.\n\nWith that in mind, to answer your question: can we ever \"short circuit\" an \"electrical\" body circuit? No, you can't; at least not using the classical definition of a short circuit. There are many things that can go wrong with the electrical processes in the body, but they aren't like short circuits in which a path of no resistance blows the circuit. The processes that govern neuron and muscle action are very intriguing, I suggest you look into them and find a good diagram like [this](_URL_0_).\n\nIf you want more information, please ask. I find this all very fascinating. There are also a few cases where there is current flow directly from one cell to another; in such cases, one could say the cells' electrical properties are similar to that of a wire, but only for a very, very short distance and time.\n\nEdit: I completely forgot your other question! I apologize.\n\nWhere is the power source? Simplified answer: everywhere. The energy the cells use to create these action potentials is generally stored in the change in voltage that occurs across the cell membrane. The voltage change induces a shape change in membrane proteins that open or close to let the ions in or out of the cell. When they open or close, this further changes the voltage which can open even more channels to let even more ions in/out. It's a wicked cool positive feedback loop.",
                "Where does the electric current in the body start?",
                "Actually, there is at least one medical condition that does meet the definition of a short circuit: Wolf-Parkinson-White.  It's the result of the derangement of the normal electrophysiology of the heart.\n\nNormally in the electrical depolarization of the heart, an electrical impulse is generated in the sinoatrial node, travels across the atria, and pauses for a brief time (usually less than 0.12 seconds) at the atrioventricular (AV) node before reaching the ventricles (the big muscles at the bottom of the heart that do most of the pumping).  The AV node acts as a gateway for electrical impulses coming from above, limiting the number of electrical depolarizations reaching the ventricles, preserving cardiac output.  \n\nIn Wolf-Parkinson-White, an accessory pathway exists (the bundle of Kent) that allows impulses to bypass the AV node and conduct directly to the ventricles.  If these individuals experience an atrial tachycardia like SVT or atrial fibrillation, it can be life threatening as the ventricles begin beating so fast that they no longer pump an adequate amount of blood to supply the body's need."

                "EDIT: I feel I should make clear that while my area of expertise is the Vietnam War, I do not command expert-level knowledge on Buddhism. Therefore, while I can explain the events leading up to Thich Quang Duc's self immolation, I am unable to explain the roots of that practice in detail. \n\nCatholicism in Vietnam indeed stems from French influence. French missionaries began traveling to Vietnam in the 1600s. The Vietnamese monarchy generally saw Catholicism as a potential threat, and so religious persecution was high for many years. This persecution was one of the main justification France used to begin annexing Vietnam. The ruling Catholic minority in 1963 was Ngo Dinh Diem's government. French colonial rule in Vietnam ended in 1954 when the Viet Minh, an anti colonial group spearheaded by the Indochinese Communist Party, defeated France in the First Indochina War. The US had supported France against the Communist forces throughout much of this conflict. After France's defeat, the US established its own presence in South Vietnam, which was a creation of the peace agreements that ended the war. Under this treaty Vietnam was partitioned in two - the Communists got the North and all other non-Communist groups got the South. Diem was a staunch Catholic as well as Vietnamese patriot who had never collaborated with the French. As such, the Americans considered him untainted - almost everyone else they could have put in power had collaborated in some way, and they didn't want the South Vietnamese government to be associated with colonialism. His Catholicism came into play because some policy makers thought Catholics more trustworthy and anti communist than Buddhists. Buddhism tends to stress neutrality and pacifism, while the Catholic Church had been strongly anti communist for decades. \n\nAfter being elevated to the office of Prime Minister of the State of Vietnam (South Vietnam's official name in 1954) Diem promptly organized a rigged election in which he transformed the State of Vietnam into the Republic of Vietnam, with him as President. In the process he kicked out the last official emperor of Vietnam, Bao Dai. Once in power Diem stacked government positions with his family members and refugee Catholics from the North. He also cracked down on all rival groups, in some cases having popular political or religious figures executed or exiled. All of this created an environment in which many Buddhist monks felt discriminated against. It came to a head in mid 1963, when several monks in the central Vietnamese city of Hue asked permission to fly the Buddhist flag on Buddha's birthday. Under RVN law, only official government flags could be flown outside. This law did not stop Catholic churches from flying the Vatican flag, so the monks did not foresee any problems. But Diem's government denied this request. In response, the monks organized a protest, at which a bomb exploded and killed several people. Diem blamed the incident on the Communists, but the Buddhists blamed his government, and immediately began organizing wider protests against his autocratic policies. Vietnamese Buddhist monks had long practiced self immolation as a means of honoring Buddha, and when Thich Quang Duc did so, he was surrounded by Western reporters, which caused the crisis to become international news.

                "No, Robert E. Lee never said this. This is a mis-quote from an \"interview\" that a reverend named John Leyburn claimed to have had with Robert E. Lee in 1869, several years after the war was over, and a year before Lee's death. \n\nJohn Leyburn had been born in Lexington, Virginia, and was a Presbyterian pastor. At the outbreak of the Civil War, [Leyburn left his church](_URL_9_) and joined the South. He became Secretary of the Board of Publication for the newly-founded Southern Presbyterian Church, since the Presbyterian Church of the United States of America had become officially pro-abolitionist. (The two churches continue to be separate today.) After the war, Leyburn resettled in Baltimore, where he claimed to interview Lee. \n\nAn article by Leyburn was printed in 1885 in *Century Illustrated* magazine, so the quote itself is second-hand knowledge many years after the fact. Leyburn claimed to have asked if Lee had fought the war over the issue of slavery, and he said that Lee denied it. [Leyburn claimed](_URL_0_) that Robert E. Lee told him:\n\n >  \"So far,\" said General Lee, \"from engaging in a war to perpetuate slavery, I am rejoiced that slavery is abolished. I believe it will be greatly for the interests of the South. So fully am I satisified of this, as regards Virginia especially, that I would cheerfully have lost all I have lost by the war, and suffered all I have suffered, to have this objective obtained.\" This he said with much earnestness.\n > \n >  After expressing himself on this point, as well as others in which he felt that Northern writers were greatly misrepresenting the South, he looked at me and, with emphasis, said:\n > \n >  \"Doctor, I think some of you gentlemen that use the pen should see that justice is done us.\"\n\nSo it would seem that this was in part an effort by Lee to resurrect his reputation after the fact. Or, it never happened, and it's something that Leyburn made up himself in order to resurrect Lee's reputation and promote Southern apologist sentiment.\n\nThere is a *bit* of truth to this view of Lee, however. In 1856, several years before the war, Robert E. Lee [wrote a letter to his wife](_URL_3_\") that explained some of his feelings on the subject of slavery, and this letter is used by most biographers as the cornerstone of Lee's personal views on slavery ([1](_URL_2_ & pg=PA173), [2](_URL_1_), [3](_URL_5_)):\n\n >  \"There are few, I believe, in this enlightened age, who will not acknowledge that slavery as an institution is a moral and political evil. It is idle to expatiate on its disadvantages. I think it is a greater evil to the white than to the colored race. While my feelings are strongly enlisted in behalf of the latter, my sympathies are more deeply engaged for the former. The blacks are immeasurably better off here than in Africa, morally, physically, and socially. The painful discipline they are undergoing is necessary for their further instruction as a race, and will prepare them, I hope, for better things. How long their servitude may be necessary is known and ordered by a merciful Providence. \n > \n > Their emancipation will sooner result from the mild and melting influences of Christianity than from the storm and tempest of fiery controversy. This influence, though slow, is sure. The doctrines and miracles of our Saviour have required nearly two thousand years to convert but a small portion of the human race, and even among Christian nations what gross errors still exist! While we see the course of the final abolition of human slavery is still onward, and give it the aid of our prayers, let us leave the progress as well as the results in the hands of Him who, chooses to work by slow influences, and with whom a thousand years are but as a single day.\"\n\nIn other words, though Robert E. Lee felt slavery was a \"moral and political evil\", he also felt it best to leave it in the hands of God to decide, and that slavery would end, eventually, on its own accord, even if that meant a thousand years hence. His letter goes on to say that the abolitionists should know that the way to end slavery is not to \"excite angry feelings in the master\" and that this would only make things worse. Lee's was not an unusual \"moderate\" point of view on slavery in the South in the 1850s.\n\nYet, even though Robert E. Lee may have felt slavery was morally and politically evil, he was not against perpetuating the institution himself. In 1856, his father-in-law, George W. P. Custis, died, and on his death bed, it was reported that he told a group of his slaves that he wanted them emancipated upon his death. But no white person was in the room, and Custis's will stated that they should be freed five years after he died.\n\nThis story reached the Washington D.C. correpsondent of the *Boston Traveller* newspaper, who printed an article about it on December 24, 1857, with the further claim that there were plans to sell some of the slaves down South before the emancipation date came. \n\n[Robert E. Lee responded](_URL_6_) by writing to the *New York Times* on January 8, 1858, denying that Custis had ever said such a thing, that the slaves would be free in five years' time according to the will, and that he had no plans to sell them \"on South\":\n\n >  \"What Mr. Custis is said to have stated to the Washington correspondent of the *Boston Traveller*, or to his assembled slaves, on his death bed is not known to any member of his family. But it is well known that during the brief days of his last illness, he was constantly attended by his daughter, grand-daughter, and niece, and faithfully visited by his physician and pastor. So rapid was the progress of his disease, after its symptoms became alarming, that there was no assembly of his servants, and he took leave of but one, who was present when he bade farewell to his family.\"\n\nWas the *Boston Traveller* passing along false information or was Robert E. Lee telling the truth? It couldn't be proven in a court of law because \"the testimony of negroes will not be taken in Court.\" So it wasn't until 1866 that the testimony of any of Custis's slaves was ever taken, and a former slave named Wesley Norris [refuted Lee's version of events](_URL_8_).\n\nThis had led Norris and several other slaves to try to escape in 1859, but they were caught:\n\n >  \"We were tied firmly to posts by a Mr. Gwin, our overseer, who was ordered by Gen. Lee to strip us to the waist and give us fifty lashes each, excepting my sister, who received but twenty.\"\n\nSo although Robert E. Lee professed a hatred for slavery before the war, and denied he engaged in the war over the issue of slavery after the war, he nonetheless was willing to participate and help preserve the institution both before and during the war. Though he freed some of his slaves before the war, he did not free the last of them [until the war was over](_URL_12_).\n\nLee's views on slavery have continued to be debated by biographers and historians. A century ago, the assessment by pro-Union authors was not kind. In a book about abolitionist John Brown, historian Franklin Benjamin Sanborn [wrote](_URL_11_) of Lee's \"lost cause\" fight for slavery and printed the alleged Leyburn quote. He followed it with his own assessment of it:\n\n >  \"I print this in justice to a brave soldier; but his warfare was as much in defence of slavery as Hector's in defence of Helen, though the great Trojan did not approve of Paris as against Menelaus.\"\n\nMore recently, in discussing Lee's alleged Leyburn quote, historian Charles P. Roland [put it](_URL_15_):\n\n >  If he actually made this statement, he doubtless exaggerated what he would have been willing to do in order to eliminate slavery, but there is compelling evidence that he was sincere in saying he was happy about its elimination (though not over the manner in which this occurred), and that he had not fought in order to preserve it.\n\nEric Foner, Civil War historian and professor at Columbia, [put it succinctly](_URL_10_) by saying, \"[Lee] was not a pro-slavery ideologue. But I think equally important is that, unlike some white southerners, he never spoke out against slavery.\"\n\n\n**Further Reading**:\n\n[Robert E.

                "You certainly could. How well you understood that time-travelling middle republican, however, would depend on your geographic origin and education. \n\nWe tend to think of \"Classical\" Latin - the Latin epitomized by the speeches of Cicero and the poetry of the Augustans - as standard Latin. In reality, nobody ever spoke Classical Latin. Classical Latin was an artificial, literary dialect, founded on the speech of educated Romans in the capital, but never identical to it. All spoken Latin was \"Vulgar\" Latin, informed by its literary cousin to a greater or lesser extent, depending on one's education. \n\nWe know little about spoken Latin in any given place or time. A few texts (such as Petronius' Satyricon) provide tantalizing glimpses. Inscriptions (and especially the graffiti from Pompeii and Herculaneum) tell us more, particularly about pronunciation (traceable from misspellings). From these traces, and from changes in \"Classical\" Latin, we can track broad transformations over the centuries. It is clear, however, that there was always very considerable variety of idiom between regions and classes. \n\nWe know the Latin of c. 200 BC from some helpful inscriptions and a few authors. The earliest well-preserved Latin author is the comedian Plautus, who does seem to reference contemporary colloquial conventions (and admired alliteration). Unfortunately, Plautus' linguistic exuberance (and the fact that he wrote in poetry) makes it difficult to use him as a source for everyday speech. The earliest extant prose author is Cato the Elder, whose work on agriculture has survived. To provide a sample of his Latin:\n\n*Brassica est quae omnibus holeribus antistat. Eam esto vel coctam vel crudam. Crudam si edes, in acetum intinguito. Mirifice concoquit, alvum bonam facit, lotiumque ad omnes res salubre est.* (156)\n\n(It is the cabbage which surpasses all other vegetables. It may be eaten either cooked or raw; if you eat it raw, dip it into vinegar. It promotes digestion marvelously and is an excellent laxative, and the urine is wholesome for everything.)\n\nThis is, of course, literary Latin, but in a very straightforward style probably similar to contemporary conversation. For want of anything better, we might take this as our baseline for spoken Latin in the time of the Punic Wars.\n\nCicero or Caesar would have expressed Cato's sentiment somewhat differently, but nothing in Cato's language was fundamentally different from that of the \"Classical\" Latin masterpieces of the following century. Those masterpieces - the works of Cicero, Virgil, and friends - were still the basis of Latin education in Justinian's time. Latin literature of the sixth century, accordingly, tends not to look too different from that of earlier periods. To take an entertaining example from Pope Gregory the Great's Life of St. Benedict:\n\n...*coepit ipse tremens et palpitans magnis vocibus clamare, dicens Currite, currite, quia draco iste me devorare vult.* (*Dialogues* 2.25)\n\n(...he \\[a recreant monk\\], shaking and trembling, began to loudly cry out, saying: \"run, run \\[to help me\\], for a dragon wishes to devour me!\")\n\nNot quite Ciceronian Latin, but there's nothing here that would have been unintelligible to Cato.  \n\nSpoken Latin had probably deviated much further from \"Classical\" norms by the time of Justinian. It is hard to say, however, how far. The Latin of Rome had always different from the Latin of other parts of Italy, and even more from the Latin of Spain or Gaul. With the disappearance of the western imperial superstructure, and the slower but equally epochal collapse of secular education, these differences became more pronounced. Some changes seem to have taken place everywhere (most famously, prepositions were gradually replacing noun cases). But the nature of one's Latin would always have been a product of origin and education - as would one's intelligibility to a Roman from the age of Cato.\n\nHopefully, someone who knows more about colloquial Latin will be able to add more detail."

                "I'm sure someone can give a much better, detailed answer. And Google can definitely give you a thorough one with pictures. But the gist of the triangle relies on three player forming the vertices of a triangle. Any one of those three players can initiate a play. Typically the triangle is set up between someone at the top of the key, someone on the wing, and someone in the low post. Since the triangle is a half court play, you don't necessarily need a traditional point guard with ball handling skills, hence why Someone atrocious like Derek Fisher was the Lakers starting point guard. The main thing you need is someone who can hit the open J if they are on the outside and someone on the inside who can keep their defender honest. The triangle is unlike a lot of other set plays in that it is fluid and the players forming the triangle need to be able to read and adjust the triangle formation accordingly. Also a reason why scrubs like Luke Walton gets so many minutes from PJ (high IQ). \n\nI've watched the Shaq-Kobe era more extensively than the Bulls era. That team under PJ was so successful in part to the triangle, which masks weaknesses in some of the guys, but also had two of the best 1-on-1 guys the league had ever seen in Kobe and Shaq. You would see them run the triangle during certain sets but PJ would allow Kobe and Shaq to free reign at other times. \n\nTo sum it up, the triangle is successful when guys can knock down perimeter shots and keep their defenders from dropping to the paint to help at the rim. The guy at the rim is good enough to keep their defender honest and guys on the perimeter have to drop low to help out, freeing the perimeter guys to hit wide open shots. \n\nAnd from what I remember, Phil wasn't the mastermind of the triangle. It was Tex Winters I believe. "

                "Primarily by making it happen to a very very small amount of material. 5.5 Trillion degrees sounds like a lot, but in terms of mass x thermal energy, the sample size at that temperate is so small that if you distributed all the energy there into a bucket of water, it wouldn't boil.\n\nThe LHC is aiming to create a very specific set of conditions on a very small sample.  They use a lot of energy to smash stuff together and witness high energy interactions, but it happens using a very small amount of mass.\n\n",
                "I'm not an expert on the LHC, so I'll let someone else explain that, but an important basis for this is the definition of temperature, which is the average kinetic energy in the random movement if particles. It might make more sense to call it the \"average particle shakiness.\"\n\nYour body right now is at about 310 degrees Kelvin (the absolute temperature scale used so that Zero Kelvin is absolute zero, or no shakiness). But you have a massive amount of molecules inside you. For our purposes, let's say it's about a trillion trillions. This means that if we could somehow suck all the thermal energy from your body and put into just 1 trillion molecules, they would each have a temperature in the range of trillions of Kelvin (or Celsius, which is basically the same).\n\nThis doesnt explain HOW energy is given, but hopefully it helps illustrate what temperature means. A single particle at a high temperature is nothing compared to the amount of energy in any visible substance.",
                "A small ice cube melts in minutes and doesnt cool you in the summer. A gigantic ice block can keep a small room cooked for a few hours. That's what happens in the LHC just with heat and not with cold. ",
                "All Celcius in this comment, but it works for any temperature scale. \n\nImagine you have a bucket of water at 80 degrees and another bucket of the same size at 40 degrees. You mix them in a bath tub and then you have water at 60 degrees. Half and half gives you the temperature in the middle.\n\nIf you have a bucket at 23 degrees (room temperature) and a single drop at 99 degrees, mixing them is going to give you a bath tub of water at 23.0001 degrees. Not even close to the middle temperature, but that's because there is not much hot water.\n\nThe same idea applies but there is WAY less than a drop of matter at 5 trillion degrees, it's a few particles (atomic particles) in a machine that weighs thousands of tonnes. ",
                "Every comment in here is explaining why it is safe, but not one person has explained how in the world a temperature measured in trillions of degrees is actually measured.",
                "Nobody seems to have explained how they measure the temperature. Well the short answer is they don't measure it, they calculate it. At that high of temperature there is nothing that can be done to actually measure it as it would melt anything that touched it (ignoring a couple other things that would make this impossible as this is eli5) and the blackbody radiation emmited from it would be such high frequency that we could not measure it based on that, and for samples of this size it would rarely emit even single photons. The way that they figure out the temperature is actually quite simple. They measure the amount of energy they put into or measure the amount of energy that can be extracted and use the amount of energy and the number of particles to figure out the temperature. For example if you put water in the microwave for a minute you would be able to figure out the temperature based on how much water you put in and the power of your microwave.",
                "A bit more eli5 than most other responses I saw. \n\nJust like you can have a light that is very big but dim and a very small light that is incredibly bright you can have a huge amount of heat that is just a bit warm or a tiny amount of heat that is extremely hot. You just can't see the difference like you can with a lamp.\n\nYou can see the effect in ice. A small cube and a big block have the same temperature but the block takes far longer to melt. \n\nIn the LHC the amount of heat is extremely small and over an uncountably short amout of time which makes it very safe to handle",
                "The difference between heat and temperature.\n\nThink about an over heated to 500 degrees for a long enough time that temperature has evened out.  Everything in the oven if 500 degrees.  The sides and bottoms, the racks, the pans, the cast iron skillet, the over cooked turkey, the burned potatoes. . and the air are all 500 degrees.\n\nIf you open the oven and put your hand in it it - it won't burn (right away).  The air is 500 degrees, but there isn't a lot of heat in it - the mass is extremely low.\n\nNow touch the cast iron skillet - your hand will instantly burn.  The cast iron skillet is the exact temperature as the air, but it has tremendously more heat because of its mass. "

                "Architeuthis and Mesonychoteuthis, the giant and colossal squid, are enigmatic and awe inspiring animals. Very little is known about the lifestyle of these spectacular animals, despite the examination of numerous corpses of Architeuthis, much of what we know about the animals' behaviour and lifestyle boils down to educated speculation. What is not so well known is that these modern squid were not the first giant squid in the Earths oceans, we have tantalising remains of animals that were at least as large as these modern species that shared the oceans with the ammonites, mosasaurs, giant turtles and plesiosaurs about 80 million years ago during the Late Cretaceous period. Imagine the difficulties of reconstructing these ancient animals when all we have to go on are fragmentary fossilised remains of the pens, or gladius, of these animals! \n\nTo date two species of Niobrarateuthis have been identified, N. bonneri and N. walkeri. N. bonneri was described by H.W. Miller in 1957 on the basis of three specimens found in the late thirties in the Niobrara Chalk at the Smoky Hills, and N. walkeri in 1977 by R.G. Green on the basis of one very badly crushed specimen. Miller regarded Niobrarateuthis distinct from Tusoteuthis longa in that Tusoteuthis had a lance-shaped gladius and lacked a prominent keel. However, it may be misleading to identify these large squid as separate animals; a 1987 paper by Nicholls and Isaak (1987) has suggested that all five teuthid species from the Western Interior Sea can in fact be regarded as one species, Tusoteuthis longa. The differences in morphology noted above could be explained as artifacts of preservation, deformations caused by crushing during the process of fossilization and misinterpretation of dorsal and ventral surfaces. The sole specimen of the gladius of Niobrarateuthis walkeri was considered by Nicholls and Isaak to be so badly broken and crushed that any attempt at reconstruction would be largely hypothetical. This theory has now achieved general acceptance; all recorded examples of Niobrarateuthis, Kansasteuthis and Enchoteuthis are now in fact regarded as one and the same genus, Tusoteuthis longa. The name Tusoteuthis has been adopted as the common name as it was the earliest name used (Logan 1898) and took precedence over the others.\n\nGiant prehistoric squid are also known from other parts of the world. At Richmond, in Queensland, Australia a 100 million year old 1.3 metre gladius was discovered by 14 year old Sonia Ievers, and has been christened Boreopeltis soniae in her honour. This is currently on display at the Richmond Marine Fossil Museum. Students in Queensland located a contemporary second gladius in 1998 that measured over a meter in length and possibly shows evidence of predation by Kronosaurus, a large pliosaur. Smaller related species of Boreopeltis are known from the Mid Cretaceous (Aptian age) Isle of Heligoland black shale deposits, Heligoland is a small island 50 km off the north German coast and has a 1m thick shale deposit that has preserved a number of fossil teuthid forms in exceptional detail, other genera found there include Mastigophora, Plesioteuthis, Maioteuthis and Trachyteuthis. \n\nBasilosaurusis one of the most common of the primitive whales, called \"archaeocetes\" by paleontologists, that have found in exposures of Middle to Upper Eocene, 35 to 40 million year old, marine sediments within central Louisiana. The species of Basilosaurus found in Louisiana, Basilosaurus cetoides (Owen), had a streamlined body that averaged 45 to 70 feet in length. Its body looked more like the body of a mythical sea serpent rather then the body of a modern whale. Basilosaurus had a wedged-shaped head up to 5 feet long with jaws containing two types of teeth. The teeth in the front, anterior, of the jaw had cone-shaped teeth which caught and held its prey while triangular-shaped teeth in the rear, posterior, of the jaw sliced them up. The type and amount of wear on the teeth of the Basilosaurus indicates that it likely ate fish and squid (Johnston 1991 Carpenter and White 1986).\n\nThe bones of Basilosaurus cetoides (Owen) and other primitive whales have been found throughout a belt across Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama where exposures of Middle and Upper Eocene marine strata, called the Moodys Branch Formation (or Marl) and the Yazoo Clay occur. The vertebrates were so common within some areas of this belt that local residents used them as andirons for fireplaces and blocks to support cabins. The bones and skeletons of Basilosaurus also have been found in Australia, Egypt, within other marine sediments of Upper Eocene age (Domning 1969, Johnston 1991, Thurmond 1981).\n\nHowever, that doesn't mean that basilosaurus ate the squid. They lived far apart from each other time wise."

I have heard that the healing process (not just the scar tissue, actual wound, etc) but the internal process of pulling the uterus back in and toning it as well as bringing the diastasis recti back together can take much longer than a vaginal birth simply because a) your abdomen was sliced open and your body has more to focus on healing, and b) the progesterone \"drop\" that happens right after the baby is pushed out and right before the placenta is pushed out causes you to have after birth pains (contractions) to tighten the uterus and pull it back into position. I have not had a C section, so I can't say if that's true or not, but a neat thing to research. ",
                "As other commenter said, the body knows once the placenta has been delivered. Also the mother is often given an oxytocin analogue injection (she would release her own with skin-to-skin contact with the baby), which triggers the uterus to contract and close down. This is important to limit blood loss after the placenta has separated from the uterus, and the uterus can only really clamp down when it is TOTALLY empty - which is why the delivered placenta has to be carefully checked over to ensure it is all there and none remains in the uterus.

                "Point of clarity before going ahead: I'm using the term \"heretic\" here to describe any person of any denomination that faced judicial proceedings for not conforming to the confession of a particular area. A Catholic in England or a Protestant in Spain both fall in this category, as would an Anabaptist anywhere in Europe besides the Ottoman Empire. \n\nAside from the clergy, it's not as if Catholics, Lutherans or Reformed Protestants dressed entirely differently or had other external signs showing their confessional affiliation. Occasionally there would be some sort of dress regulation within a community, but these were generally enforced at the local level. So for example, a Calvinist consistory or town council in the Protestant Netherlands or Languedoc might have certain regulations about dress or behavior, but these would apply to any covert Catholics that happened to be within the community as well.\n\nFinding crypto-heretics then took some work. The Inquisitions are generally the most well-known searchers of infidelity, but they generally didn't go door-to-door seeking signs of heresy. An Inquisition court (or consistory or town council in Protestant lands) more often than not had people reporting suspicious activity. If someone stopped attending mass, or started baptizing other adults, or began preaching in the pubic square (like Ignatius of Loyola did to garner the attention of the Inquisition), that was generally a good sign that you had a heretic in your midst. Snitching was certainly something that people did, and accounts in Inquisition court records often relied on reputation as much as an observed action in dealing with potential heretics. On the other hand though, by the late sixteenth and early seventeenth century, local parishioners were more interested in sussing out witches than covert Protestants or Catholics. \n\nIf surveillance failed, the main way to figure out someone's denomination was to ask them. Yes, they could lie, and many people did lie. Lutheran, Reformed, Anabaptist and Catholic moral theologians all wrote vehemently against the \"demonic temptation of apostasy,\" but there were qualifications made, especially in the latter half of the sixteenth century, to support individual cases of what was called [Nicodemism](_URL_0_). Lying aside, simply asking was a far more effective way of investigating heresy than one might think. More often than not, heretical thinking was just the result of misguided notions. Inquisitions generally sought to find out where the suspect had fallen into error and correct them, with punishment only coming later. For those that understood full well that they were committing heresy, many of them were okay with facing the penalty. The Reformation saw the resurgence of martyrdom as a transconfessional discourse. People were proud, sometimes even delighted at the idea that they would be killed for the promotion of their faith. Showing steadfast loyalty to the gospel truth (however one defined it) in the face of certain death and torture was an admirable trait, and one that would be rewarded in the afterlife. \n\nGenerally (and I have used that word a lot in this because nothing is the same everywhere) the people that were persecuted for heresy were publishing, preaching or openly speaking against the dominant confession of their area (and often against the local or royal authority therein). There are cases of clandestine heretics, such as Jesuits in England, being \"discovered\" and rooted out, but generally heresy was a public outburst rather than private wrongthink. \n\nN.B: This is not a universal opinion. Some historians would point to the many pogroms or outbreaks of mob violence against suspected heretic groups as evidence against what I have just said. I am merely talking about heresy as a crime being punished in a normally operating government system. \"Suspicious\" persons (whether due to race, nationality or confession) within a community are consistently treated violently throughout history. \n\nSources:\n\nI think a book that gets at the heart of your question is Perez Zagorin's *Ways of Lying,* even if it is not directly about surveilling dogma. One that is a bit more on point for that would be John Tedeschi's *The Inquisition in Early Modern Europe,* but it is a bit of a more difficult read. Brad Gregory's *Salvation at Stake* is indispensable in talking about martyrdom in the Reformation. And of course, no reading list about heresy in early modern Europe would be complete without mentioning Carlo Ginzburg's *The Cheese and the Worms.*"

                "I hate to ask this, but can you track down Given-Wilson's citation?  I ask because sovereigns weren't first minted until the 1480s-90s, I think.\n\nBUT, if Given-Wilson just means pounds (since a sovereign *was* nominally worth a pound), then I can give some insight.  Wool farmer John Lyndewood (father of William Lyndewood, who rose to bishop) left this bequest in his will:\n\n >  Item. I bequeath to the 30 churches in whose parishes I was wont to buy wool that they may pray for my soul and for the souls of those to whom I am beholden, £10, leaving it to the discretion of my executors to choose the villages.\n >  Item. I leave for distribution among poor folk of the country-side, especially in villages where I was wont to buy wool... £10.\n\nTen pounds is a generous amount.  \n\nBased on the UK National Archive's [Currency Converter](_URL_0_), £10 in 1410 is worth ~£6,300 today.  That's an utterly useless number, because spending was entirely different in that sort of economy.  But, more useful, is the table they provide below:\n\n >  In 1410, you could buy one of the following with £10: \n >  Horses: 7 \n >  Cows: 17 \n >  Wool: 55 stones\n >  Wheat: 32 quarters\n >  Wages: 500 days (skilled tradesman)\n\nFirst of all, it's worthwhile to know that 55 stone of wool equals 770 pounds (weight) of wool.  That's ... a lot.  \n\nSecond, five-hundred days of a skilled tradesman's wages isn't exactly clear: do they mean working days?  Are they spreading these wages out over all 365.25 days of the year?  I'm not sure.  What I do know is that they're telling us that it's more than the average artisan makes.  \n\nHopefully this will do until a more comprehensive answer emerges."

                "Hiya!! So house names generally are associated with last names, (Habsburg, hollenherzen, etc.). However I think in the case of A Song of Ice and Fire, this is likely a case of Doylism winning out. In the Middle Ages, the idea of a \"last name\" was not particularly standardized even among the nobility.\n\nMany of the house names we associate with the period are fairly anachronistic, they were attributed by historians after the fact. For example, the French kings are generally referred to as Capetians, but they wouldn't really utilize Capet as a surname, they would be associated with the place or title that a person had, so Louis of France or king of the Franks or king of France. And if we are applying later standards for last names, there would be no changes at all! Let's say that Hugh Capet actually used Capet as a surname. That would mean that every French monarch till the revolution would have the last name Capet. Not only that, but this dynasty was fairly prolific, so the kings of Portugal, the dukes of burgundy, the kind of Sicily, would all have the same last name of Capet using modern standards. \n\nSo generally, house names tend to get applied after the fact, the failure of Philip IV's line marks the start of the Valois dynasty, who were agnatic first cousins of the king, but were also count of Valois. This is also helpful because it breaks up periods, specifically the start of the hundred years' war. This happens in English history too, many of the early noble families who started adopting a practice of last names, tended to associate it with a location, such as their original Norman landholding. Even the houses of Lancaster and York as well as the name Plantagenet are somewhat anachronistic. Richard Duke of York is associated with the house of York, but used Plantagenet kind of as a last name to emphasize his male line succession for Geoffrey of anjou, ancestor of the kings of England, who was nicknamed Plantagenet due to a flower he wore in his hat (he was contending with another Plantagenet, Henry VI). We call him Richard of York and his sons yorkists to clarify factions during The Wars of the Roses (medieval nobles had an annoying habit of reusing maybe five first names all the time). Previous kings did not use a last name, they were associated with their title, \"king of England.\"\n\nSo the main issue here is more that medieval nobility did not use last names in the same sense that we do, they were associated with a place/title (Habsburg from Habsburg castle in Switzerland) or with their father (Louis son of Charles). If they lasted in to the later or modern period, name conventions changed or historians retrospectively added dynastic names for clarity (Plantagenet, carolingian, Capet, etc.). So I think this more is attributed with trying to make things easier for modern readers, who would not appreciate having to keep track of things like just King Robert, whose brother is Lord Stannis of Dragonstone. Last names did come about later in the period, but not in the same strict sense that we have today. The queen of England's style is likely a marker of tradition, harkening back to the medieval practices of association with place. Hope this helps!!"

                "The permanence of a Gothic language in Crimea is a rather problematic question : until recently, the only extensive source about it was Oghier de Busbecq's accounts in his *Turkish Letters* for a Germanic-speaking people living in southern Crimea. At no point he affirms they were Goth, only to say he couldn't tell if they were Goths or Saxons. He nevertheless made a point to list a series of words from one of two, or both peoples, from the region : a native Germanic-speaker having lost much of his native language, and a Greek having learnt enough of it.\n\nIt happens that this part of Crimea, the former principality of Teodoro/Mangup, was also called Gothia by Byzantines : it is not just a late medieval reminiscence of Late Ancient Goths (although, Goths mentions are more probably artefacts in several case) as the Tale of Igor's Campaign does mention \"Gothic maids\" in the XIIth; and the \"Gothic lords\" mentioned in the letter of Zachariah, Prince of Matrega, to the Protectors of the Bank of St. George.Mention of Goths in ecclesiastical titles until the XVIIIth century, however, doesn't imply an ethnic or linguistic survival no more than Gothia (roughly lower Languedoc and Catalonia) and Goths being accounted for in the VIIIth to XIth centuries in southern France _URL_0_ doesn't implies, however, that these Goths kept a distinct ethnic and linguistic identity, no more than early-medieval Gothia (roughly fitting Lower Languedoc, then Catalonia) and its nobles calling themselves Goths until the XIth century.\n\nSo, looking at Busbecq's list, can these words be tied to what we know of Gothic language, trough Ulfila's Bible and other, limited and scattered, sources from the Vth century?It's hard to tell : while there's some phonological elements that makes Crimean Germanic speech relatively close to Ulfila's Gothic language, a lot of phonological and lexical elements seems closer to evolution that happened separately in Low German dialects. While this language might have been called Gothic, it might not have been a direct evolution from Late Ancient Gothic.\n\nWe do have medieval accounts, however, with William De Rebruck and John Galafontibus. It doesn't tells much however.\n\n > There are great bluffs or capes in this sea from Khersona up to the mouths of Don, and forty or so castles between Khersona and Soldaia whom each have its own language; there is also many Goths, that still use German as their languagez\n\n & #x200B;\n\n > Along and around the Black Sea live two small nations: Tats and some Goths. In their religion, they follow the Greeks and use Greek  letters. \\[...\\] Goths can claim to be descended from the Scots and speak like the English.. They live along the shore near Kaffa, and also in Tartary and Cumania.\n\nBut there was certainly a Gothic-speaking population remaining in Crimea, at least until the Xth/XIth century : [in 2015, evidence of Ulfila's Gothic language in this sense was discovered on Mangup's basilica as five graffiti.](_URL_1_) So the question is less if Late Ancient Gothic existed in Crimea, but how long did it survived and why this Germanic speech in late medieval Crimea, while having Ulfila's Gothic elements, tends to look a lot as Low German?\n\nThe traditional opposition is about a distinct Gothic language from Ulfila's Gothic having more or less survived as a scattered idiom even in Crimea, and a medieval western Germanic emerging as German speakers (or Anglo-Saxons if you're following the accounts on Nova Anglia on the Black Sea) settling and being influenced by a remaining Gothic speaking _URL_2_ far, there's not enough evidence to have a clear and definitive answer, although the regular comparison to western German speeches shouldn't be dismissed.\n\nRegardless of its nature, it survived until the XVIIIth from the reading of Johann Christoph Adelung. He basically say that in place where Goths were believed to have lived, some Tatars (originally Christians) speaks a language close to Low German that he was able to understand sometimes.  \nConsidering it means Gothic language, as a direct descendent of Late Ancient Gothic, survived until the XVIIIth is quite optimistic,to say the least, and not an established fact.  \n\n\nWhat do we have then?\n\n\\- Late Ancient Gothic-speakers were still present in Crimea until the Xth century\n\n\\- People identifying themselves and being identified as Goths lived in Crimea at least until the XVIth century, but their language isn't obviously tied to Late Ancient Gothic, explainable either due to a separate evolution, either due to a Low German influence or dominance with Gothic as a substrate.\n\n\\- This Germanic language probably living on until the XVIIIth century."

This led to a raid against Rome itself in 846 by a band of opportunistic Arab mercenaries, who were not numerous or organized enough to breach the city's Aurelian Wall - which was not a huge loss since they were able to load themselves down with booty from churches outside the walls. A second attempted raid in 849 was repulsed at Ostia. \n\nSicily was conquered by Norman forces (with the assistance of local partisans) in the late 11th century.

What the film never showed is that after attacking a muslim caravan during the 1180s, which caused a few skirmishes between the Kingdom of Jerusalem and Saladin, he went on to raid the Red sea coast, his goal being to burn down Mecca and Medina. Problem is, he was pretty much gone rogue in regards to the Kingdom of Jerusalem. His raids were not supported by then King, Baldwin IV. As a result, besides a few coastal villages he didn't raid much and his band of mercenaries were quickly captured and executed while he fled back to his castle. "

                "I would say its because the distances in space are higher, so it moves much less, relatively. Try and take a picture of a mountain while you run on a road. Assuming you can move smoothly (like a spaceprobe) the pics should be clear",
                "A large part of the difference is that this kind of tech is VASTLY beyond the realm of consumer electronics.\n\nThat phone, in total, cost you about $1000.  And that's retail, the actual hardware is significantly cheaper.\n\nA top-notch DSLR costs maybe $3000?  And again, retail pricing.\n\nNew Horizons cost $700,000,000, it's the size of a small car, and it's nuclear powered.  For several hundred thousand times more money, you get camera and stabilization tech that can't even begin to be compared to the stuff they cram into a mass-produced gadget for a manufacturing cost of about $100.",
                "On top of what others already said, I'd add that objects in space move in a very regular motion (line or ellipse) which makes it easier to track the object during capture. On the other hand, you hand trembles in a way unpredictable to your camera, which is why no digital stabilization compensation is possible. ",
                "You're conflating two different technologies. While consumer cameras and cameras on spacecraft fundamentally work the same way, they're designed for entirely different things. You're comparing apples to oranges. It's not that one is better than the other. They're simply not interchangeable.\n\nThat's also even the issue here. What's happening is that the spacecraft is just far away from the object they photograph. Think about when you're on a plane and you look at the window. The ground below appears to be barely moving, despite the fact that you're moving at 600mph. You can whip out your camera and take a perfect picture of the ground below you because it's far away. ",
                " > when my DSLR/phone camera can't even take photos with a decent amount of clarity with small hand vibrations?\n\n >  Why are the image stabilisation technologies in commercial products so dated?\n\nThe brilliant thing NASA did was to make a spacecraft without any hands.  \n\nThe speeds are astronomical, but effective speed varies with distance.  It takes a fast shutter speed to freeze a housefly in flight, but a jet in the sky is easy to photograph.\n\nThe camera on New Horizons is named Ralph, and wit works more like a scanner than a camera.  It uses CCDs, which have been supplanted by CMOS chips in high end cameras.  But it has seven of them, each one is 5024 pixels wide by just 32 tall.  5024 pixels is roughly equivalent to a 16 megapixel camera, but by scanning and stitching, very high resolution is possible.\n\nThe sun is fairly dim out there, but the cold temperature helps achieve low noise at relatively high ISO.  [Amateur astrophotographers sometimes build coolers for their camera sensors.](_URL_0_)  This was especially prevalent around the time when New Horizons was built.  CCD chips build up heat while they capture data, CMOS chips develop less heat.",
                "It's not the research that's the problem. You have a lot of different things at work:\n\n* Size. You can get higher resolution and faster imaging by increasing the size of your sensor field and the amount of sensors on it. You actual light sensor even on a DSLR is probably a lot smaller than the one on New Horizons, and the one in a smart phone is tiny. The same goes for lenses, mirrors and similar, you can get phenomenal detail just by making everything *bigger* because you can gather more light at once.\n\n* Production. This one is twofold, scale and price.\n * Price: You do not only pay to research and develop a product, you need to actually build it. For a space probe, nobody will blink if the camera will cost a million dollars just to build it. But you will not want to pay $1,000,700 instead of $700 because of a camera. Economies of scale cannot make something infinitely cheap, they can primarily spread fixed costs (like research, building the factory, things you pay only once, regardless of how many things you build afterwards) on a lot of products, bringing them close to zero per item built and enabling you to deal with higher fixed costs like research into more efficient factory technology or similar, but besides that you cannot do much with scale to bring down labor, power and material costs.\n * Scale: You cannot produce cutting edge technology at scale. For a space telescope or probe, every little piece can be made with highly specialized equipment by highly specialized people. If it takes half a year to build a part, that's ok. But for consumer products, there better be a few thousand each day or even each hour, because it is a mass market. That means you cannot produce at the one-off quality you do for space probes.\n\n* Environment.\n * On earth, even if you hold your camera perfectly still, you have air in the way. Air with different temperatures, that have different density, and therefore break light a tiny bit (this is what makes heatwaves appear). Small dust particles floating in the air can scatter tiny bits of light. All this means is, in out atmosphere, you never have the perfect situation that every bit of what you photograph has exactly one ray of light impacting exactly one sensor on your camera. Some of that light goes elsewhere, but some other light might be scattered to this sensor from elsewhere too. It's never perfect. But space, space is empty. No air to bend light. Almost no dust to scatter any.\n * Tolerances for space hardware can be insanely tight. You can spend more on just making sure your high tech equipment is delivered to you and launched into space without being damaged than you can spend on a dozen phones or DSLRs. And once actually in space, you have quite constant parameters. Yes, you can have big temperature differences between areas in direct sunlight and in shadow, but there's no shifting humidity. No bumps, no sudden movements anymore. You can create instruments with astonishing precision for space that would not work in consumer technology because your environment is rougher and constantly changing.\n * Disturbances are almost non-existent in space. As others have pointed out, in space objects have very stable movement you can anticipate more or less flawlessly, especially the relative movement, compared to one another. On earth, even if you do not hold it in your hand, there will almost always be some vibration coming even though the ground. It's way to tiny for you to notice while photographing things on this planet, but it would get in he way if you photograph across the distances involved in astronomy.\n\n & nbsp;\n\nAll this together means you cannot afford that quality of equipment as a normal tool, you would not want to lug it around with you, it would be too sensitive for normal work and if you could afford it and could wield it and it wouldn't break, our atmosphere would ruin your shot anyway."

                "Revenge was certainly a part of it. Soviet political officers would put together a 'revenge score' where they'd interview the soldiers in their unit and compile a master list of all they had lost during the war.  After this was done a poster would be put up that said something like \"We are now getting our revenge for 775 of our relatives who were killed, for 909 relatives who were taken away into slavery, for 478 burnt-down houses and for 303 destroyed farms\".  Or, to quote the Soviet writer Ilya Ehrenburg \"Do not count days; do not count miles.  Count only the number of Germans you have killed.  Kill the German - this is your mother's prayer. Kill the German - this is the cry of your Russian earth.  Do not waver. Do not let up. Kill.\".  I'm not aware of anywhere (outside of Nazi propaganda) where Soviet authorities were explicitly calling for the rape of German women, but it's easy to see how the fury they were whipping up to motivate their soldiers to fight could overflow into criminal behavior. \n\nAt the same time it would be impossible to put all of this down to revenge.  There were cases where women in occupied territory were raped by advancing Soviet troops, and even Russian women who had been taken as slave labor and then later raped by their fellow countrymen. None of this makes sense in the context of revenge. \n\nI don't know how it would be possible to give a percentage breakdown of the different causes, but there's obviously multiple different things going on here;\n\nAt the most basic level there are just a certain % of people out there who will commit rape if they can get away with it. A soldier in enemy territory is going around armed and surrounded by potential victims whose only recourse is to try to seek justice from the same organization their rapist is a part of. In terms of sheer opportunity, it doesn't get much 'better' for someone who's already inclined to commit rape.\n\nThe sheer brutality of the war in the east may have contributed somewhat as well, both in terms of the men committing the rapes and in their comrades who were allowing it to happen.  At the same time there have been a huge number of men who have suffered all kinds of war trauma who didn't become rapists.  This should show that war trauma is not an excuse, and is at best only a partial explanation. \n\nCultural factors also certainly play a role.  Rape is a social problem, and the attitudes that the rapist has been inculcated with certainly play a part in his activities.  According to Beevor, looting implicitly meant rape as well in the Red Army.  That idea doesn't make much sense unless you regard women as property, which is obviously a deeply patriarchal notion. With that being said, the idea that the USSR(with its official doctrine of equality a large number of women involved in combat operations) was uniquely patriarchal seems a bit absurd. \n\nIt's also important to note that these different factors aren't mutually exclusive.  A soldier who was committing rapes purely because the opportunity presented itself might justify his behavior to his comrades by calling it an act of revenge.  They might be willing to look the other way because of the effects of previous wartime experiences.  This only makes it more difficult to disentangle what the \"real\" cause of this phenomenon was. \n\nI hope this has been useful to you even if I couldn't provide a definitive answer.  If you have any questions I'll answer them if I feel able. \n\nSources:\n\nBeevor, A. (2003). The fall of Berlin, 1945. New York: Penguin.\n\nLowe, K. (2012). Savage continent: Europe in the aftermath of World War II. London: Viking.",
                "I harbor some doubts towards an explanation that seeks to assign cultural factors major explanatory power. /u/kieslowskifan gives an amazingly in-depth treatment of the Red Army's behavior in East Germany [here](_URL_0_). Next to the factors mentioned here and by /u/ZizeksHobobeard -- revenge mentality, brutalization by war, the prevention of the normalization of the relationship between occupier and occupied, similar occurrences in the other Allied zones --, another reason why I am very hesitant to chalk the Red Army's behavior to cultural factors is the general prevalence of this phenomenon in WWII.\n\nWe often tend to focus on the Red Army when it comes especially to rape. And while this as pointed out in the linked answer above was also a phenomenon that occurred in the Western Allied zone, the focus on sexual crimes of the Red Army among the Allied army is somewhat justified because of the sheer scale of it. What does get overlooked often and why I am hesitant to assign cultural factors major explanatory power is that this phenomenon on the German side is still very underresearched.\n\nWe of course do know about the crimes committed by the Germans in the Soviet Union. However, rape usually has no place in this narrative. This is an incredibly hard subject to research but there are some indications that a similar behavior seems to have been endemic in the German occupied Soviet Union. Pascale R. Bos cites figures in her article *Feminists Interpreting the Politics of Wartime Rape: Berlin, 1945\"; Yugoslavia, 1992–1993 Journal of Women in Culture and Society, 2006, vol. 31, no. 4, p.996-1025*: A German Wehrmacht survey from 1942 estimates that 750,000 babies had already been born from contact between German soldiers and Russian women. This is a conservative estimate and covers only the time frame up to 1942. While not all of these might have come from rape it still shows how endemic the problem must have been.\n\nWendy Jo Gertjejanssen writes in her thesis [Victims, Heroes, Survivors. Sexual Violence on the Eastern Front during World War II](_URL_1_) about the prevalence of violence on the Eastern Front during the German attack on the Soviet Union. She shows that the German military ran hundreds of brothels on the Eastern Front with a still unknown number of women being forced into prostitution through starvation or at gun point. She asserts that in addition to criminal behavior being made official policy with the Barbarosse decree etc., there also was an official policy of sexual exploitation of Soviet women that affected thousands if not hundred thousands.\n\nShe also goes further and writes:\n\n >  Rape by armed men was a reality on the eastern front. Members of the German Army, the SS and police, the Red Army, and armed partisan fighters raped women and girls all over the east, from a wide variety of backgrounds. The leadership of neither military did much to prevent its men from sexually assaulting civilian women and girls. A few men were punished, and there are stories of Soviet officers shooting soldiers who were guilty of rape. The available evidence, however, indicates that these were exceptions. Rape was not viewed as a crime, let alone a brutal attack against a person. Although rape was not a formal military tactic by either army, rape was deployed as a means of terror by both the Germans and the Soviets, and there was a tacit understanding that the armed men had a right or even permission to rape women and girls. The complicity of both the German and the Soviet military leaderships during the war and the denial of governments, states, veterans of war, politicians, and other national and international leaders has been pervasive, unmistakable, and generally, a disgrace.\n\nWhile here too, it is virtually impossible to get definite numbers, Gertjejanssen basically goes to show that sexual violence had been part of the Eastern Front theater basically since the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. And while this, of course, does in no way negate or relaitivize the behavior of the Red Army in Germany, it is a very strong argument against what Norman Naimark argues. If the sexual violence of the Soviet Army was so strongly rooted in culture, why did the Germans behave in a strikingly similar way? I think what this shows is that the issue of sexual violence as an essential part of the fighting on the Eastern Front is a heavily underresearched topic and that we need to be very careful when looking at the Soviet in Germany example and assigning explanations without knowing or considering this background."

As a result, it becomes photosynthetic and never needs to eat again. However, its offspring are not born with the plastids. Plastids need to have their chlorophyll periodically regenerated, which is done by the algae cell itself usually. However, it seems that plastids in elysia are maintained for the slug's lifetime, and the genes for producing the necessary proteins are present in the elysia's nucleus. [This paper](_URL_0_) considers the possible explanations, one of which is that the genes for generating chlorophyll transferred from the algae to the elysia at some point, which would mean it has genes from something outside its kingdom."

                "Alright, Hua Mulan.  In most traditions of the story she was a resident of the state of Northern Wei, the longest-lasting of the Northern Dynasties (386-535CE) of the Northern  &  Southern Period (420-589CE).  There are, of course, other tellings that put her in the Sui/Tang period, and certain others that put her in a nebulous “sometime in ancient and faraway musical *Chiiiiina*”… but most tellings put her in Northern Wei.\n\nThis creates from the outset some very interesting and problematic issues with the Disnified version.  For one, though Mulan and her people are indeed called to serve against invaders, it’s never specified in the *Ballad of Mulan* which invaders they’re talking about, and it *certainly* never talks about “Get[ting] down to business to defeat the Huns/Xiongnü”… because, well, the “Huns” were already there, in Northern Wei… as its emperors, officials, and population.  Northern Wei was a Tuoba xianbei state that had partially sinified itself… but was still viewed by the Southern Han Chinese (of the Liu Song and Southern Qi Dynasties, respectively) as *themselves* the barbarians.  From the *Ballad of Mulan:*\n\n >  昨夜见军帖，可汗大点兵.\n\n >  trans: ““Last night I saw the draft posters, The Khan is calling many troops.\"\n\nFrom later on in the poem, after Mulan and her army has won the war:\n\n >  归来见天子，天子坐明堂。策勋十二转，赏赐百千强。可汗问所欲，木兰不用尚书郎，愿驰千里足，送儿还故乡。\n\n >  trans: “On her return she sees the Son of Heaven, The Son of Heaven sits in the Splendid Hall. He gives out promotions in twelve ranks And prizes of a hundred thousand and more. The Khan asks her what she desires. “Mulan has no use for a minister’s post. I wish to ride a swift mount, To take me back to my home.”\n\nThe Son of Heaven is the Khan, and the Khan is the Son of Heaven.  Flibbity-flibbity-floo.  The fact of the matter is that especially northern Chinese history is far, *far* more of a cultural and ethnic melting pot than quite a few realize, or would care to admit.\n\nSo these invaders could have been the Chinese themselves, or the Tibetans, or Tuyuhun, or the Ruanruan Khannate (which seems a likely choice)… but the one thing they were *not* were the Huns/Xiongnü… because neither existed in any meaningful capacity by this point.  But ah well, I’m getting off topic…\n\nWe can infer quite a bit about the era she lived in and the likely consequences of her actions by the reactions of those around her – both her family, and later on the soldiers she’s come to lead in combat:\n\n > 可汗大点兵。军书十二卷，卷卷有爷名。阿爷无大儿，木兰无长兄。愿为市鞍马，从此替爷征。\n\n > 东市买骏马，西市买鞍鞯，南市买辔头，北市买长鞭。旦辞爷娘去，暮宿黄河边。不闻爷娘唤女声，但闻黄河流水鸣溅溅。旦辞黄河去，暮至黑山头。不闻爷娘唤女声，但闻燕山胡骑鸣啾啾。\n\n > 万里赴戎机，关山度若飞。朔气传金柝，寒光照铁衣。将军百战死，壮士十年归。\n\n >  trans: The Khan is calling many troops. The army list is in twelve scrolls,  On every scroll there’s Father’s name. Father has no grown up son, Mulan has no elder brother. I want to buy a saddle and horse, And serve in the army in Father’s place.”\n\n > In the East Market she buys a spirited horse, In the West Market she buys a saddle, In the South Market she buys a bridle, In the North Market she buys a long whip. At dawn she takes leave of Father and Mother, In the evening camps on the Yellow River’s bank. She doesn’t hear the sound of Father and Mother calling, She only hears the Yellow River’s flowing water cry tsien tsien.\n\n > She goes ten thousand miles on the business of war, She crosses passes and mountains like flying. Northern gusts carry the rattle of army pots, Chilly light shines on iron armor. Generals die in a hundred battles, Stout soldiers return after ten years.\n\nShe's not sneaking off in the middle of the night on a stolen horse with a borrowed saddle.  She says to her parents, \"hey, Dad can't go fight, I'm gonna go buy a horse and go off to war.\"  And her parents don't try to stop her.  Yeah, sure, they're sad and all, but such is life in a time of war.  What they're *not* terribly concerned about is the fact that she's a girl.\n\nBecause the historical Mulan isn't some pale-face beauty (ok, well she *is*, but that's not her only or even most important quality.)  The *Ballad* paints Mulan as more of an Ellen Ripley-esque certifiable badass.  There's no \"I'll Make A Man Out of You\" montage in the poem, because she is beating the snot out of her fellow soldiers from day one.  Even the Khan take note:\n\n >  On her return she sees the Son of Heaven, The Son of Heaven sits in the Splendid Hall. **He gives out promotions in twelve ranks And prizes of a hundred thousand and more. The Khan asks her what she desires.** “Mulan has no use for a minister’s post. I wish to ride a swift mount, To take me back to my home.”\n\nMoreover, there's no mid-war gender-reveal.  Instead, she reveals she \"he's\" been a \"she\" these past 12 year only after the war, and voluntarily to her brothers-in-arms:\n\n >  脱我战时袍，著我旧时裳。当窗理云鬓，对镜帖花黄。出门看火伴，火伴皆惊忙：同行十二年，不知木兰是女郎。\n\n > 雄兔脚扑朔，雌兔眼迷离；双兔傍地走，安能辨我是雄雌？\n\n > “I open the door to my east chamber, I sit on my couch in the west room, I take off my war time gown, and put on my old time clothes.” Facing the window she fixes her cloud like hair, Hanging up a mirror she dabs on yellow flower powder. She goes out the door and sees her comrades. Her comrades are all amazed and perplexed. Traveling together for twelve years They didn’t know Mulan was a girl.\n \n > “The he hare’s feet go hop and skip, The she hare’s eyes are muddled and fuddled. Two hares running side by side close to the ground, How can they tell if I am he or she?\"\n\nHer comrades are all sorts of \"amazed and perplexed\" that this ultimate badass was a smokin' hottie the whole time, yes, but she obviously believes that there's no danger in letting them know.  No punitive action is going to be taken against her... certainly nothing like Shen threatening her at swordpoint for the crime of saving his live while having gross girl-germs.\n\nThis hearkens back to the fact that Northern Wei, for all it desperately wanted to be, was *not* totally culturally Chinese... it still had many of the social and gender norms inherited from the Asian steppes and their formerly nomadic traditions - traditions like boys *and* girls should be trained to fight and defend their home, they should *all* be capable with the horse, bow, and sword... and that it was not entirely unheard of for men and women to serve alongside one another.  \n\nMoreover, Mulan in all her tellings serves as a paragon of the Chinese Virtue Above All Other Virtues: *filial piety.*  Sure, she's a girl, but her dad has no grown sons, and he can't effectively serve his lord... she she helps him by serving the khan on his behalf.  That is hardly something to be punished in Chinese value systems.\n\n________\n\nThis does change - as does the story itself - if it moves to a different time period.  Chu Renhou's *The Sui Tang Romance* moves the tale of Mulan up in time to the Tang overthrow of the Sui, ca. 618 CE.  moreover, it was written in the Qing Dynasty of the late 17th century.  Now, Chu borrowed *heavily* (and copied verbatim in more than a few places) from the earlier (pub. 1633) *Forgotten Tales of the Sui Dynasty*.  Nevertheless, it is very *very* focused on the idea of suicide or ritual defacement to establish its female characters with virtue and honor equal to men.  Thus, in the tale of Hua Mulan, we first get a twist of her being found out, but by the *warrior-princess* Dou Xianniang, who tries to recruit Mulan as a man, but then pledges to keep her secret and becomes sworn sisters.  But by the end of the tale, Xianniang's father is captured by the soon-to-be-Emperor Taizong of Tang, and they surrender themselves to suffer his punishment in his stead.  Taizong sees this as a supreme act of filial piety and (in the book) commute the death sentence of Dou Jiande (in reality, no, Dou was executed), and Mulan sent home to relocate her parents.  Harsh reality sets in, however, when she discovers that her father has died, and her mother remarried.  Worse comes to worst when Taizong's ally the Göktürk Khan summons her to his capital to become one of his concubines... at which point she decides to commit suicide rather than suffer such a fate.  From Martin W. Huang:\n\n >  Her suicide is particularly baffling since at the time she is not in love or engaged with anyone and since she is only half-Chinese (her father Turkish, but her mother is Chinese).  Hegel provides the possible explanation that this is intended to be a loyalist message: “even a half-Chinese woman would prefer death by her own hand to serving a foreign ruler.”  Also worth mentioning here is Mulan’s  explanation for why she has masqueraded as a man to join the military: “Feeling ashamed that there were not many loyal subjects and filial sons among men, I decided to take the risk to dress myself as a man.”  Here Mulan is apparently blaming the incompetence of men as one of the reasons that she felt compelled to join the military.  In other words, there would have been no need for her to do so if men had been competent enough to fulfill their duties.\n\nYet even in this telling where her femaleness does result in tragedy, it's again not the emperor or a military officer threatening to cut her down for her womanhood... indeed, though Taizong was prepared to have her and Xianniang executed, that was *because they were captured enemy combatants*, not because they were women. (Hell, Taizong's own sister, Princess Pingyang, was leading her own anti-Sui \"Women Peasant Army\" at this same time... and I should note that the Tang rulers were themselves semi-Turkic). Rather, the issue is having her fate taken out of her own hands as a result: going from being a respected army officer, to being the concubine of a foreign lord."

                "Let's start with a general introduction to the South African apartheid state of 1948-1991 which generated the name for an 'apartheid' system. If you have the time, you can take a look at Worden's excellent introduction to the general history of the country and its political system. \n\nBroadly, the colony that would become the independent state of South Africa had a preexisting racial hierarchy based primarily on land ownership (and therefore economic power in an agrarian society). This skips over a significant chunk of the political interplay between the various colonial parts that would come together into South Africa. However, in order to maintain this power post independence, the white minority constructed a legal framework for \"separateness\" between the constituent races of country (White, Black, 'Mixed', and Indian). These laws and the culture enforced by them resulted in some very specific things that stand out: massive involuntary relocation of majority populations; the creation of defacto 'states' for the unwanted majority to stay in; and the systematic creation of a narrative regarding the history of the country to justify these moves. \n\nThe reason why I drew these three things out is because they serve as *key* points of comparison to look at the United States in the post Civil-War era. I'm relying heavily on the below text by Lassiter (which I've read most recently). There are plenty of sources that cover this material and even your question including Kushner's work.  On the first point, while there was a significant amount of population movement in the US (particularly post 1910 - The Great Migration), it would be a reach to call this intentional and organized relocation of populations by the federal state. On the second point, there is no case where the US, or any of its constituent states created a fictional legal framework of sub-states or territories to corral and otherwise contain African Americans to a specific geographical area. On the third point; there was the creation of a myth to justify the history of the South, slavery and its role in the Civil War (e.g. \"State's Rights\") and the follow on Jim Crow-era petty segregation laws.\n\nSo, yes, there were a significant number of similarities between the two regimes. Petty apartheid laws were abundant; clear cultural distinctions were made between groups based solely on skin color; a narrative was constructed to justify these acts. On the other hand, the scale and scope of the legal actions taken by the minority white community on the majority black community were different and guided by the geographical reality and history of each country. In some ways, due to the preeminence of the US Federal Government and its dilution by Northern/Western states means that the apartheid structure in the US was vastly less centralized, much less systematic and much less obvious than in South Africa. \n\nSourcing:\n\n\n > Kushner, James A.

                "I have to begin by pointing out that the evidence for Heraclius changing the official language of the empire is minimal, as it is dependent on one of Heraclius' edict in 629, which included in his titulature this important phrase 'πιστὸς ἐν Χριστῷ βασιλεύς' (transliteration: 'pistos en Christo basileus') - 'emperor, faithful in Christ'. The gist of the argument is this: previously, official documents were written in Latin and Greek sources would have used 'autokrator' to refer to the emperor, the Greek translation of the Latin 'imperator' (a relic of the Romans' aversion to anything monarchical). 'Basileus', however, definitely had a royal connotation and is previously only used to refer to 'barbarian' kings and the emperor of Persia. As a result, when Heraclius referred to himself as a 'basileus', this was viewed as an important turning-point, as the use of this Greek word can be seen as an indication of a change in the official language of state and a wider cultural shift within the Roman state.\n\nUnfortunately, I don't think this argument, originating in Ostrogorsky's *Geschichte des byzantinischen Staates* (1940), stands up to scrutiny today. For one thing, we know that Greek was already used within the imperial bureaucracy, perhaps as early as the fifth century under Theodosius II, as a praetorian prefect then allegedly issued laws in Greek. Nor was this a unique occurrence. From Christopher Kelly's excellent *Ruling the Later Roman Empire* (2004):\n\n >  In 397 the emperors Arcadius\n >  and Honorius had allowed provincial governors to issue their judgments\n >  in Greek. In September 439, Theodosius II confirmed the validity\n >  of wills written by Roman citizens in Greek. By the turn of the\n >  fourth century, Latin was no longer the language of instruction at the\n >  empire’s most prestigious law schools in Constantinople and Berytus\n >  (modern Beirut). Legal textbooks and commentaries were written in\n >  Greek. From the mid-530s on, most of Justinian’s legislation (unless\n >  specifically directed at the Latin-speaking West) was promulgated in\n >  Greek. His law of 535 ratifying the mid-fifth-century emperor Leo’s\n >  regulations on the alienation of property by religious foundations set\n >  out the advantages of this change simply and clearly. “We decree that\n >  this law [of Leo] shall be valid in all these matters, and we confirm it.\n >  And for this reason we have promulgated and caused it to be written\n >  not in the language of our ancestors but in everyday speech, that is, in\n >  Greek, so that through ease of understanding it might become known\n >  to all.”\n\nMore evidence can be found in the sixth century. John Lydus, a bureaucrat working in Constantinople, complained bitterly that less and less officials were learning Latin - for him, knowledge of Latin was an essential part of being Roman. His contemporary, Procopius, also noted that (albeit in a text written to diminish Justinian):\n\n >  He [Justinian] then appointed Junilus (a Libyan by birth) [as the quaestor], a man who had not so much as a hearsay knowledge of law, for he had not even studied it in the public schools. Although he had a knowledge of Latin, he had never had any tuition in Greek, and was unable to speak the language. Frequently, when he attempted to say a few words in Greek, he was laughed at by his own servants.\n\nIn both cases, it is clear that the use of Latin was nowhere near universal within the upper echelons of power. Of course, this did not mean that Greek was now the official language, since Latin was evidently still being used, most dramatically in Heraclius' silver coinage, which featured the Latin phrase 'Deus adiuta Romanis' - 'God, help the Romans!'.\n\nAs a result, I don't think we can definitely say that Heraclius changed the language of state during his reign - at most, he was making official informal trends. As /u/Growlinghamster pointed out [in this thread](_URL_0_), 'the use of the title “Basileus” wasn’t some radical, out of left field change that Heraclius just sprang on his unsuspecting subjects'. The same, I think, was true for the usage of Greek - we simply don't have any evidence that any emperor had deliberately changed the 'official' language (especially since the empire still possessed territories in the Latin West). To prove this, we would probably need a surviving legal text or an extensive discussion of the edict in a historical source, none of which exist to my knowledge. It is better, I think, to view the changing prominence of Latin and Greek within the Roman Empire as a gradual thing, rather than a sudden transition, since this interpretation fits better with the evidence we do have."

                "Yes indeed the US has commissioned Privateers by Letters of Marque on two main occasions.\n\nThe first was the Quasi War with France in the Caribbean in 1798-1800. However the relatively restricted in time, space, and scale of that conflict meant that only a few score really got into the action.\n\nThe far larger case was the War of 1812 when several hundred vessels of all sizes were commissioned. They sailed from every port from Maine to Georgia, and were instrumental in capturing the majority of the 1,500 or so British vessels taken during the war. And though by 1814 the British bloackade of the American Coast had become sufficiently strong to greatly reduce their numbers and freedom of movement, Privateers never stopped putting to sea completley and still made their mark. By taking prizes they could also impact the British war effort, forcing the diversion of ships for convoy duty and escort, driving up insurance rates in Britain, and diverting other resources. For instance one of the main reasons that Baltimore became the second target of the joint Army-Navy force under Ross, Cochrane, and Cockburn after they burned Washington, was the large  number of Privateers based out of Baltimore. \n\nIn the end somewhere upwards of 500 vessels were used as Privateers, each with a commission from President Madison after Congress delegated to him the authority to issue them early in the conflict. Most were very much on the smaller side though, between 100 and 300 tons displacement and no more than 12-14 guns with lighter armed and smaller ships aplenty. Meanwhile regular naval ships were generally much bigger, the modest sloop USS Wasp was 450 tons for instance and the big 44 gun super frigates Constitution, President, and United States all weighed in around 1,500!\n\nSeveral could be rather bold and certainly many became quite happy with their profits derived from captured ships and good. Thomas Boyle, even notably proclaimed the entirety of the British Isles to be under blockade in a tongue in cheek response to the British blockade of the US which took quite some time to go from being in name only to actually effective. \n\nBut with the end of the war that marked the real end of American Privateers. Lack of any vastly superior maritime foe to defeat was part of it, and by the last decade of the 19th century the practice itself had fallen out of favor internationally while the US Navy was growing into a force that was large enough to both project power abroad and protect the sea lanes of communication. \n\nIt should be noted many were issued by the Confederate Government though their validity was of course challenged by the US and they experienced uneven recognition in European ports and courts. Something that was true of the Confederate Naval war effort in general. ",
                "[](/flufflepirate)The US issued Letters of Marque during the Quasi-War and the War of 1812. The Confederacy issued some during the Civil War.\n\nThe Quasi-War was an undeclared naval conflict between France and the US from 1798 to 1800. The US signed an alliance with France during the revolutionary war, including a mutual defense pact. However, the French monarchy was overthrown, and the US didn't want to be dragged into the subsequent British/French war. The US signed the [Jay Treaty](_URL_7_) with Britain, affirming neutrality with the conflict. France didn't particularly like this state of affairs, and they sent privateers to prey on American shipping heading to Britain. The US tried to build up it's navy with the [Naval Act of 1794](_URL_2_), but the US was far behind their French rivals. The US returned the favor by commissioning [1,000 privateers to attack French ships](_URL_5_).\n\nDuring the War of 1812, the US navy was still pretty pathetic. President James Madison issued Letters of Marques during the war to attack British shipping to help supplement the US's meager fleet. Here is the letter issued to Captain Million: _URL_4_\n\nIn 1856, most of the great powers of Europe signed the [Treaty of Paris](_URL_0_), which banned Letters of Marque. The US didn't that document. However, during the Civil War, Lincoln wanted to keep the European powers out of the war, and refused to issue letters of Marque to comply with the Treaty of Paris. The Confederacy didn't oblige the treaty and [issued Letters of Marque to attack American vessels](_URL_1_).\n\nSince the Civil War, the US hasn't issued Letters of Marque. There is a legend that the Goodyear blimp had one during WW2, although [that story been debunked](_URL_3_). There was a recent small attempt to bring the Letters of Marque back. In 2007, Ron Paul introduced a [bill into Congress that would allow the President to issue letters of Marque to take the property of Al Qaeda.](_URL_6_) However, so far attempts of revival have not stuck."

                "If there was a way to absolutely control how your body responded to certain compounds, poisons wouldn't work. Your body just handles what it can in a predetermined fashion, and dumps out the remainder. ",
                "Molecules are much more than just what atoms they are composed of. Each molecule also has a specific shape and properties (like, it's electrically charged in one area, or acidic in one area, etc).   \n\n\nAt the most basic level, your body is really just a bunch of chemical reactions occurring in very tightly controlled environments separated my membranes (whether they are cell membranes or even small compartments inside of cells called organelles). The body doesn't \"think\" about what to do when it encounters a particular molecule. Whatever chemical reactions will happen in that environment will just happen. \n\n & #x200B;\n\nThey way many reactions in your body happen is through enzymes--these are little molecular machines usually made of protein that help chemical reactions develop in a certain way. If you throw A into it, it will give you B and if your throw Y into it, it may give you Z. But it won't do anything when it encounters C, because it's the wrong size or D because the shape is wrong, or E because it's got the wrong electrical charges, etc.  \n\n\nSo when it comes to Aspirin, it doesn't shut down the nervous system. Aspirin binds to an enzyme (a molecular machine) called COX and prevents COX from doing its job. Normally, COX produces a bunch of molecules that do things like cause inflammation (so aspirin can reduce swelling, fevers, etc) and molecules that cause your nerves to send pain signals (so you experience less pain). However, some of these molecules also affect your blood's ability to clot (so aspirin can increase bleeding to a degree), and other molecules are involved in the production of mucous in your stomach, which helps protect it from stomach acid (so aspirin can also lead to stomach ulcers in some people).  \n\n\nYour cells' environment is very important to all of this. For a much more advanced example, let's say you've been fasting for a while and your cells are set up to break down your stored energy to make sugar. Then you eat a bunch of rice.  In your digestive system, the rice molecules are broken down into sugars by enzymes that break down sugars (different ones break down proteins and fats). The sugars then bind to enzymes on the walls of your intestine and allow the sugar to get absorbed into these cells and ejected into your bloodstream. The high levels of sugar in your blood cause them to bind to other enzymes and tell them to release hormones like insulin into your blood. Insulin then travels around your body and binds to other enzymes turning them ON. These enzymes then start producing molecules in your cells that turn ON other enzymes. \\*Those\\* enzymes then bind to \\*other\\* enzymes and turn \\*them\\* ON as well.   \n\n\nNow that the right group of enzymes has been turned ON, when they encounter sugar molecules they will join them together so they can be stored as long chains of sugars called starches which can be used for energy later on. When the levels of sugar in your blood fall, you stop making the hormones that call all of this to happen and they turn off. At the same time, other hormones are released that activate another set of enzymes that will now break down these starches back to form sugars which your cells can use for energy. (The reality is a little more complex--in many cases, an enzyme that takes A and makes B, can also take B and make A. It's the overall environment of the cell at the time that dictates which direction the chemical reaction goes).  \n\n\n  \n"

                "You're asking an \"ought\" question, so it's important to know what the criteria are for that \"ought\" (or whether \"religion aside\" is even possible). A lot of considerations functioned in the Church's decisions about the canon through successive assemblies. However, we can say at minimum that the Church expected the texts it selected to accurately reflect apostolic teaching, which it deemed inspired and authoritative.\n\nThis is something the historian may be in a position to say something about. However, the subject is controversial, and experts are far from unanimous. And even this criterion, which dates to the 2nd century, gets muddy.\n\nFor example, what counted as \"apostolic teaching\"? Many of the Gnostic schools claimed access to \"secret\" apostolic testimonies. The 2nd-century heretic Marcion believed only Paul faithfully conveyed the gospel of Christ; the others went astray. Hence Marcion's canon included only a purged version of Luke's gospel plus ten \"authentic\" Pauline epistles: Galatians, 1 and 2 Corinthians, Romans, 1 and 2 Thessalonians, Ephesians, Colossians, Philippians, and Philemon. However, by \"apostolic teaching,\" most of the Church Fathers meant teaching in line with the \"[rule of faith](_URL_0_)\" delivered in oral and written form by the original apostles, six in particular: Matthew, Peter, Paul, John, James, and Jude. And unlike Marcion, most were not in a hurry to figure out exactly which books counted or did not, which is why our complete list of canonical NT books doesn't appear until a letter of Athanasius in 367. For centuries after Christ, different communities used slightly different sets of books as scripture (that is, for reading during services). The term \"canon\" itself did not appear until the fourth century.\n\nDespite that fuzziness, some broad statements can be made. The synoptic gospels and the major Pauline epistles were universally accepted \"except among the more extreme proponents of Jewish Christianity\" (Ackroyd and Evans). These formed the \"core\" of the early Church's scripture, and even fringe groups such as the gnostics made use of them. The rest of the canonical NT was used some places, but was unknown or not recognized in others until a certain point.\n\nWhat do today's historians say about these texts? Well, every one of them has been questioned, and textual criticism suggests a larger group of writers were involved in their creation than tradition has passed down. The four gospels, especially Mark and Matthew, are very old, and probably do represent original apostolic teachings. Luke and Acts were less privileged until the second century, when they became very important for a heresy-embattled Church. Paul probably wrote the epistles attributed to him, except for the Pastorals (Timothy and Titus), with Ephesians, Colossians, and 2 Thessalonians being divisive among scholars. Who wrote these, if not Paul? Colossians, Thessalonians, and Ephesians were written, if not by Paul, by devoted followers. Who wrote the Pastoral Epistles is an open question.\n\nWhat about the other epistles in the New Testament, which it appears some early Christian communities used and others did not? 1 Peter was widely received early on as being authentically Petrine. 2 Peter and Jude were widely accepted by the end of the 2nd century. Hebrews was attributed to Paul by some in the early Church, but nobody accepts that now; nevertheless, it holds an important place in the canon. The origin of James is highly controversial, with some scholars claiming it was not even authored by a Christian; it was one of the last books to receive recognition from the Church.\n\nHowever, in all this I have left out the \"Johannine\" writings: the gospel, epistles, and apocalypse all attributed to St John. These books and their relationship to one another are disputed, but many would suggest they are products of a \"school\" that has its roots in their reputed author, John the Apostle. The Gospel of John and 1 John were accepted earliest; at the other end, Revelation was one of a number of Christian apocalypses circulating in the early Church, distinguishing itself perhaps most by its compelling literary construction and compatibility with the rest of the New Testament.\n\nIn short, regarding the canonical texts of the NT, there's a spectrum of plausibility as to which authentically stem from the hand or teaching of a recognized Apostle, and few clear answers. I don't have time at the moment to say anything about other books that claimed scriptural status in the early church; I'll come back to that later, or leave it to someone else.\n\n**Sources**\n\nBruce Metzger, *The Canon of the New Testament*\n\nP.

                "The term was made up to describe a problem with trying to negotiate with a country that has an elected legislature and high turnover -- I believe the original example was Turkey, in the earliest years of their democracy. Who do you even call to negotiate *with,* when whoever you call might not even be there two years later?\n\nThe answer? The bureaucracy. All of the mid-level management who stay in the same jobs in the foreign ministry, the defense department, and so on even when the legislature changes hands, the people who work one level down from the political appointees. And because they're below the \"surface\" of the democracy, they defined them as the \"deep\" state, as opposed to the \"surface\" or elected state. *In its original usage, it wasn't necessarily sinister.*\n\nBut it rapidly came to be interpreted in sinister ways, because narrow interest groups have always complained that when their coalition or party gets elected, having promised them the moon and the stars, they do not get the moon and the stars. And sometimes it is, in fact, because elected politicians went to the department of whatever and the department of whatever said, \"we physically, literally cannot give them the moon and the stars\" or \"it's illegal for us to give them the moon and the stars\" or \"we can, but it'll cost a billion trillion dollars and take a hundred years.\" And usually, if they say that, it's because it's true. But whether it's true or not, the politician then goes back to his voters and says, \"I promised you the moon and the stars, and having voted for it and won, you deserve the moon and the stars, but I was stopped from giving them to you by those unelected 'elites' in 'the Deep State.'\"",
                "As stated already, it's typically used to refer to some sort of shadowy secretive cabal that operates outside of public view that controls the policy directions of the visible government.\n\nWhether this is actually the case in the U.S. and to what degree can't really be said. But I think it's important to understand that an actual 'Deep State' needn't be visualized as defined above. It is quite possible for the un-elected officials (bureaucrats) that outlast elected governments to function as a 'Deep State' without explicitly meaning to. Especially those involved in foreign policy decisions, as decisions made in this sphere typically have consequences that will span the multiple terms of different elected governments.\n\nThere was a bit in the JRE podcast interview with Edward Snowden that I think is pretty relevant:\n\n[_URL_0_](_URL_0_)",
                "Deep state in a nutshell refers to bureaucrats and lifelong unelected officials in government that are not subject to being removed by voters and push government policies and practices in the directions that they want.",

By this I mean they have their own political views, but these are not discussed at work, and they do the work of the state, answering to the government of the day. They work through various administrations, but generally this doesn’t impact the overall mission or day-to-day. Pentagon, FBI, CIA etc. Trump has used this term because he is annoyed he can’t fire people who aren’t director-level political appointees, and feels these organisations are against him. In actual fact these people are often patriots who could be earning more outside, and who work for the best interests of the country as signed for as part of their job. \n\nTLDR - Trump thinks he should be able to control every aspect of the various apparatus of government, like a dictator could in Russia or China. He can’t, by design, so he made it sound conspiratorial and blames it for the checks and balances blocking him from doing stupid/illegal stuff.",

If they don’t like the party in power, they can get rid of them easily. The PM can be killed like Benazir Bhutto and her father or they can undergo kangaroo court corruption charges, like Gilani and Sharif. So the country is effectively ruled by an unelected and unaccountable deep state. Demagogues use the term to malign anyone in civil or administrative service in the government.

Those folks just have to bear the brunt of being associated with (((THEM)))\n\nWhat they mean is the secret cabal of nefarious individuals who actually pulled the strings of government. America seems to have this weird thing where we always think there's some sort of cabal of individuals controlling everything. The current term tends to be deep state, international bankers, Soros, or any variation on the three. They are all variations on the Jewish global conspiracy.

If a deep State did exist, it would likely be made up of a small group of highly ranked employees who could subvert or influence policy decisions without the public's knowledge.",

The founding fathers were quite aware of people like Trump and his ilk and set up a constitution that would stop much of what they are trying to do. Still, we, the People, must be more vigilant in supporting this work through voting, running for office and doing more civil service.",

                "The crime of treason under Roman law was known as _maiestas populi Romani minuta_ (the diminution of the majesty of the Roman people).  Prosecution generally involved three investigative sessions which included the presentation of evidence and arguments on both sides.  This was followed by a final session where a military tribunal (_comitia centuriatia_) reached a verdict.\n\nThis information is drawn from [_The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome, Vol. 1_](_URL_0_).  The article is available on Google Books and has this to say about the application of the charge:\n\n >  The charge seems to have been deliberately left without close definition, but it was applied to those who obstructed or used violence in popular assemblies and to those who failed as commanders (333).\n\nThe entry mentions, though, that the definition alters slightly over time.  As this isn't my specialty, you might want to message /u/Tiako.",
                "The main problem in Rome was the 'who', not the 'why', if you like. It was widely acknowledged that Roman citizens could be executed (imprisonment was a very rare punishment in Rome), but many maintained that they could only be sentenced to death by a court run by a tribune. However, you can look at examples such as the execution of the Catilinarian conspirators in 63 to explore your question more clearly.\n\nL. Sergius Catilina had, according to Cicero (who was a consul for 63), been plotting against the state along with a group of others, such as Lentulus (a senior senator) and Cegethus. In his First Catilinarian oration, Cicero urges Catiline to leave Rome and take his co-conspirators with him. Catiline did leave (though he left many of his fellows behind), joined a rebel band, and so was clearly an enemy of the state. Cicero's co-consul, Antonius, was sent with an army to deal with him. There were no survivors.\n\nHowever, Cicero still faced the problem of the conspirators left in Rome, and his Catilinarian orations 2-4 try to portray them as *hostes* (enemies in war). He sets himself up as a *dux togatus* (toga'd/civilian captain), and with this purely rhetorical framework persuades the Senate to hold a \"trial\" of Lentulus etc. (as narrated in the Third Catilinarian). In the Fourth Catilinarian, Cicero is summing up in the Senate (probably - the source is complex), and he reasons that because these civilian conspirators are plotting against the state, they are *hostes*, and so not citizens, and the Senate can execute them without reference to the courts. He bases this on a *senatus consultum ultimum* ('Final Decree/Decision of the Senate'), passed a month earlier, that instructed the consuls 'to see to it that the Republic should suffer no harm'. However, it was on the basis of this action (though actually for political reasons) that Cicero was exiled in 58 under the *lex Clodia*, and many of his speeches subsequent to (and during) 63 can be seen as partly aimed at reminding people that he saved the Republic by \"the only means necessary\".\n\nThere are a couple of other similar examples, such as the earlier clubbing to death of Gaius Gracchus, and all revolve around the definition of citizens and senatorial power. I know that wasn't exactly the focus of your question, but if we make it active 'what did *x* consider treason during the Roman era' (and I talk only of the Republic) , we need to supply who does the considering, which in many cases gives you the answer for which you asked.\n\nIf you're interested in Roman laws, have a look here:\n_URL_0_\n\nOr, if you can read Latin/Greek:\n_URL_1_\n\nYou could also try Lintott's classic book, *The Constitution of the Roman Republic*, which has a good chapter on the *senatus consultum ultimum*, and a helpful bibliography.\n\n(Sorry that's a bit long.)",
                "Actually, patricide also carried the death penalty. Killing your father, the man who gave you life, was considered as bad as treason if not worse.\n\nThe traditional penalty was [*culleus parricidae*:](_URL_0_) to be stripped in public, have all one's skin whipped off, and be put in a sack (culleus) together with a dog, a cock, and a monkey, which would then be thrown into the sea. Or, for practicality, one might simply be butchered or devoured in the arena.\n\nThis was famously at stake in Cicero's first major trial, the defense of Sextus Roscius in 80 BC. [Recommended](_URL_1_) (though the Moroccan extras don't really look all that Roman).\n",

The accepted punishment was to entomb them alive because it was forbidden to spill their blood.",
                "During the life of the Roman Republic, capital punishment was performed more often and for a wider array of different crimes. If a public servant, most notably a judge, was caught accepting a bride, he would have his nose cut off and then he would be stuffed into a large bad with a rabid or aggressive animal. The bag was sewn shut and then thrown into a running river. Lying under oath was also punishable by capital punishment. The Romans considered the integrity of their legal system to be the fountain from which all other institutions of the state and society drew their life-blood from. Not surprisingly, to violate the court's integrity, and thereby threaten the state's health, perjurers were thrown from a cliff, the Tarpeian Rock, to their deaths. "

                "I worked for an arena that is about 60 years old. It is a wooden dome structure. After 60 years of concerts, sporting events and just about everything else they discovered that many of nuts that had worked loose, the bolts themselves hadn't moved much if at all. Just the nuts meant to keep them from moving came loose. They are massive too probably weighing around 16oz a piece and there was several thousand of them. Luckily none had come all they way off. From the roof to the floor was about 60 feet.",
                "Generally speaking, not a problem. What does have to be considered is the potential for dynamic loading being higher than the static loading. In places where there is likely to be music, everyone dancing/jumping at the same time means that the design load should be increased. For some specific numbers, the Australian code (AS/NZS 1170.1) gives 1.5kPa for a typical household area, and 5.0kPa for a dance halls and studios.\n\nThe dynamic frequency of the structure should be considered, but that's more so that the floor doesn't feel exceptionally \"springy\" underneath. You don't want people to be able to feel the vibrations when they step, because it's somewhat disconcerting. My uni had a walkway specifically designed to have this vibration \"feel\" as an example of why there needs to be sufficient internal damping. This is normally only an issue for steel frame structures, but over given spans can be an issue for concrete/timber as well.",
                "Its usually not an issue. I work at a company that makes loudspeakers for all sorts of applications. We have a room we use for reliability testing. This room is quite small and we rest loudspeakers that go into stadiums and are designed to throw hundreds of feet away. We push these systems past there limits and then run them like that for weeks on end. The only structural issues we have had is in the panels we use for the connections going on and out of the room. There have been some issues of the connectors becoming loose but that’s it. We even have some small racks for cables screwed into the wall that have been fine. To be fair this room was designed for this application. But we are talking many many thousands of hours, and in a room that’s small so the energy doesn’t spread out much. It’s worst case scenario in there. And the amount of energy we put into the room would take several decades to get to In a normal venue. And the importance on the size of the room can’t be overstated. Take car audio for example. There are lots of car audio competitions and people posting videos of them blowing out the glass or a girls hair flying all over the place in a car. But that is completely different than a concert venue. In a car it is such a small space that your acoustically coupled to a resonant chamber. This allows for a lot more pressure because it has no where to go. \n\nAll that being said who knows. If a structure happens to have the right resonant frequency it’s definitely feasible that he PA causes damage. \n\nFor example the millennium bridge in London had an issue where the resonance  of the structure was the same as the average pace of a person walking. They initially had to close the bridge down because it would shake so badly people couldn’t walk on it. They solved this by hanging weights under neath the bridge and tuned the weight and distance they hung them at so their resonant frequency would cancel out that if the people waking. ",

The music caused the filling to be detached from the steel framework and in danger of collapse."

                "I can talk a little bit about this! English is my second language, so forgive any errors. I can mainly speak for the socio-cultural part.\n\nIn Roger Worth's 'On the South-Americas', and in 'Walking Ghosts' by Steven Dudley, the issue of violence in Colombia (from last centuries '40s up until the date of writing the respective books) stands central.\n\nThe bottomline he arrives at, is that first and foremost is geography, which may sound overly simplistic and far-fatched. But historically speaking, Colombia’s vast, difficult geography has made it extremely challenging for the central government in Bogota to extend control over its territory. This meant that well into the 20th century, the nation was more like a string of loosely associated villages than an integrated community with a strong sense of national identity. Regional and family loyalties trounced all. This means that loyalty to a nation, as we in the West would know it, is not as normal or as expected as it would be here. Great distrust exists against the government which is only worsened by the image of government officials being corrupted, or needing some sort of monetary compensation to fulfill otherwise 'normal' duties.\n\nThe second reason why violence remains a fundamental part of Colombian life is the legacy of the “La Violencia.” 200,000 people died in a totally pointless conflict between the Liberals and the Conservatives (one is reminded of the scene in “One Hundred Years of Solitude” in which Colonel Aureliano Buendia observes the main difference between the two parties is that the Liberals go the mass at five o´clock and the Conservatives at eight). “La Violencia” is a historical trauma that the country still has not properly dealt with. Thousands were displaced and migrated to cities, where hopelessness and lack of opportunity created a vicious cycle of gangs and crime. Campesinos also migrated to other rural areas even further away from state control. The power vacuum left after “La Violencia” allowed groups like the FARC and the ELN to rise to power. Ever since the 1940s you would be hard-pressed to find a Colombian who doesn’t have a family member who was killed, injured or traumatized. There is no doubt that the effects of “La Violencia” have created the social and political reality that Colombians live in today, even though thanks to the “politics of anesthesia,” such a historical trauma is barely present in the public consciousness.\n\nThe third reason for Colombia’s violence-ridden nature is that informal behavioral norms in Colombia encourage corruption and crime. There is a huge gap between what Colombia’s constitution and lawmakers pronounce, and the way that laws are actually enforced in practice. For the young men who make up the military and police force, this distinction between what is legal and what is culturally acceptable creates situations wherein it is more rewarding to break the law than follow it. In part, you could say that the reason why in Colombia there is such ambivalence towards following legal norms is because for a long time, legal norms were imposed from above by a small group of social and political elites, without much care in enforcing them and without much input from the marginalized majority. Why then should the majority of the population respect the laws formally endorsed by the state? This still echoes throughout society today, combined with a close feeling of 'community' over 'state', that very much paved the way for the issues Colombia still faces today.\n\n\n\n"

When that occurs in pregnant women whose fetuses are still developing, it can simply stop certain developments from happening. This causes things like low bone density, malformed bones, lack of eyes or limbs, underdeveloped brains.\n\nIt's not just Southeast Asia that suffers from it many births in the USA have been affected by the chemicals because soldiers that were caught in the sprays have the poison in their bodies and passed it to their spouses via semen and caused defective births.",

If the incidence of deformity is the same in two populations, a small population with a small birth rate may have 1 case per year, where as a large population with a large birth rate may have 10 per year.\n\n**Prenatal Care** :\nIn western countries prenatal care is routine. Prenatal vitamins: Folic acid decreases the incidence of neural tube defects, as part of prenatal care. Women have routine ultrasounds to look for anomalies / birth defects. If the defect is not correctable, termination of pregnancy is an option.\nMany women in 3rd world countries have little or no access to health care, and the deliveries occur at home.\n\n**Genetic**: Asians have higher incidence of Cleft lip.\n\n**Infectious**: In western countries all children are given Rubella vaccine as part of MMR, and are immune to rubella. (except for children of anti-vaccers). In developed countries women that get the Rubella infection for the first time during pregnancy can have children with (deafness, blindness, heart defects, microcephaly).\nNo prenatal care also means women are also not treated/screened for vertically transmitted infections (TORCH).\n\n**Post Natal Care**:\nBirth defects in western countries are treated early so the prevalence is lower.\nIn the 3rd World, the birth defects are not corrected due to expenses of surgery. So there are more babies/children in the population that have defects.\n\n**Environmental / Food Regulation**\nWestern countries have more regulations, and regular monitoring of environmental pollutants. USA has FDA, and EPA. The air in China and India is filled with pollution. No regulation of Milk mean many cases of E. coli, and Tuberculosis.

                "I suspect you might have a hard time finding out exactly the answer you're searching for, for a number of reasons. Bio-inspired flight, and in general a detailed analysis of the aerodynamics of flying animals is a relatively recent research topic. I work in it rather indirectly; I can give you some general conversation, but not much for direct answers. Aerodynamics researchers typically aren't looking at the effects of individual feathers, but rather look at the general planform shape. Determining the effects of that single feather would be very difficult from an experimental point of view; I can simulate a rigid wing of that shape with and without that feather and tell you something, but when birds spread these outer feathers it tends to be in maneuvering and landing, where the airflow becomes very unsteady, and the feathers are anything but rigid. You can't just stick a bird in a wind tunnel and perform any kind of reliable experiment.\n\n\nIf I had to give an educated guess about the potential use of that feather based on the schematic given, I can think of a few reasons.  At high angles, a wing planform like that (without the feathers spread out) will stall on the outboard section before it will stall on the inboard.  You don't want to stall on the outboard, because that's where you have the best moment to control your body (i.e. aircraft have ailerons more on the outboard) -- check some youtube videos of hovering/landing birds to see how their muscles control the feathers. If you can keep the flow attached over that outer section, you'll prevent stall. To me, that feather looks a lot like a [leading edge slat commonly found on aircraft](_URL_0_), which would aid in allowing those larger outboard feathers to control the bird's attitude.\n\n\nI'll add that it's a mistake to assume all biological features have a \"purpose\" or \"function.\" It could a remnant of something that was useful further up in the evolutionary tree, or it could just be some genetic quirk that stuck around.\n\nOh, and I'm not terribly caught up on the state of research from the biological side. If this is actually an important mystery to people that study birds let me know; it could be enough of a reason for me to throw some computer time at it =P\n\n\nedit: After gazing at [this youtube video of a hawk hovering](_URL_1_), I'm reasonably confident that that feather is functioning as some kind of combination between a leading-edge slat and a vortex generator, both of which would energize the boundary layer of the controlling sections of wing directly behind it and aid in control."

        "selftext": "Let me preface by saying I have no clue what I'm talking about.\n\nThe CO_2 causes Venus to trap in more heat from the sun, thus making the surface temperature nearly 900F degrees. If we introduce, plant or plant like(I say plant-like because I know it is too hot for normal plant life), organisms that convert CO_2 into oxygen, theoretically we could lower the temperature enough to make it inhabitable for humans.\nI believe that the high CO_2 is also causing the atmospheric pressure to be extremely high compared to Earth, so the Oxygen will help to lower the ATM.\n\n",

As I recall, one source cites the lack of support by the Judean People's Front leadership to the plan to allow men to gestate babies in a box. Others have said it was the lack of availability of truly crunchy wolf nipple chips. While they were hot (and lovely), they were not crunchy. This caused a rift in the rank and file membership and ultimately caused the founders of the People's Front of Judea to go their own way.\n\nA relatively unknown fact is that the People's Front of Judea also didn't like the Judean Popular People's Front, either.",

You could say that the PFJ was much more aware of the positive effects the Romans had on the Judean region. Don't be mistaken though, the truly hated the Romans.

They were also very vocal and positive about the Roman wine, medicine, public health and irrigation. Most of all, they recognized the fact that the Roman military was probably one of the only known organizations capable of maintaining public order in a place like that. However, despite all of this, they still hated the Romans **a lot** and often raised the question as to what the Romans had ever done for them.\n\n In contrast, the JPF never even acknowledged these improvements and they were a lot more linear in their thinking.

                "I see PFJ's progressive stance on mens' rights to have babies, regardless of having a womb led to more men to join PFJ. The more men in PFJ led to that group having a bigger role in the patriarchal society of the time.   Thus the JPF fell by the wayside.",

(We will pass by the short lived People Of The Paragraph - their story is just too sad.) As People Of The Sentence, they were hyper-aware of the importance of sentence structure. And indeed unpublished sources tell of endless printer's ink being spilled in the endless Writer versus Editor struggles.\n\nPeople's Front of Judea clearly puts the People into the position of honor. The movement was far more interested in, and enthusuastic about, individuals being the most important factor.  This would be revived later as The Great Man theory.\n\nRejecting this, in favor of putting the community identity as critical, the Judean People's Front emphasizes the importance of the masses. This would later lead to Social Revisionist history.\n\nTwo groups with less in common cannot be easily thought of. About the only thing they shared was the ability to always look on the bright side of life.\n\nSource: A Wasted Youth, privately printed 2010, by Eternally65, PhS, LCD, FRHG.",
                "You also need to remember that JPF was actually willing to engage in a dialogue with Bickus Dickus about how awful the Roman empire was, and how all Romans were wankers who needed to go home. The PFJ was dead set upon any interaction with Romans, no matter how awful they were, as such conversations and heckling would only legitimize the continued presence of the Roman imperialists.\n On the other side, the JPF felt that actively insulting Roman nobles, rather than sullen grumbling, was an effective political tactic in repelling the Roman imperialists.\n\n Source: Bickus Dickus, Di Amor di Incontinentea Buttox",
                "The People's Front of Judea and the Judean People's Front both had their origin in the Social Democratic Party of Judea, which later became complacent with working within the Roman provincial system for incremental gains, forgetting its revolutionary origins.\n\nThe PFJ and JPF began in the left faction of the SDPJ. Soon, this faction began agitation for armed resistance, while the party's dominant faction claimed that revolutionary conditions had not yet been met. The left faction split off from the party, denouncing the remaining SDPJ as social fasces-ists. However, not a few years later, internal divisions emerged in the nascent People's Front, laying the groundwork for the future split into the PFJ and the JPF.\n\nThose in what would become the People's Front of Judea argued that the revolutionary class would be the proletarii, those with little to no property, allied with the urban slaves. The PFJ advanced the view that the material conditions of these classes necessitated their eventual action against the Roman provincial order, whereas the rural peasant class represented more reactionary interests. Meanwhile, the Judean People's Front argued that as Judea lacked the urbanization of Rome, the PFJ's revolutionary theory had to be adapted to the real material conditions of the province. The JPF thus focused on the radicalization of the Judean peasant class, though debate over the extent of their inclusion of wealthier peasants remains heated, especially in consideration of accusations of some of their leaders' links to wealthier peasant family members. \n\nThe JPF further split between the main party and the JPF (Maoist) in 12 AD. Another faction split into the Judean Popular People's Front, disagreeing with the main party's stance against religion, arguing that the Jewish religion was a traditionally imperialized religion, separate from the traditionally imperialist religion of the Romans, and that it was thus racist to denounce it, taking criticisms of the religion as criticisms of the imperialized people who followed it. The JPPF allied with the Zealots and eventually blended into their movement. The JPPF was further alienated from the rest of the movement when a member of the JPF (Maoist) [assassinated a religious leader who had a controversial relationship with the Romans and the people's favorite opium](_URL_0_).\n\nMeanwhile, the People's Front of Judea experienced its own schism, as a small faction split off into the Popular Front of Judea, claiming to follow the revolutionary theory of Josip Broz Tito. At first glance, this appears to be an anachronism, given that Marshal Tito was not born until some 18 and a half centuries later, but the historical record is unimpeachable here and so we are left with some competing theories to explain this revolutionary development. Refer to earlier posts on Time Lords and automobiles manufactured by the DeLorean Motor Company.\n\nAnd don't get me started on the Judean Anarchist Federation...",
                "There's a well known quote in Judaean Insurrectionist Studies of the Late Second Temple Period: \"Four insurrectionists, six movements.\" Because of their antinomian tendencies, the groups' refusal of Roman or Torah or priestly authority also led to distrust of any authority whatsoever, even among like-minded individuals, and hostility to the appearance of submission to anything like authority. Any point of ideological difference was not resolved by submission to authority or consensus, but by creation of very specific policy statements to which all followers must adhere. Ideological purity was considered more important than group cohesiveness or even action. An action driven by improper (or even suspect) ideology was worse than no action at all.\n\nThe Popular Front of Judaea (PFoJ) was only the second schism. The Front for the People's Judaea (FPJ) split off from the JPF, and, along with elements more sympathetic to the PFJ but still wary of fasces-ist tendencies, was eventually absorbed into the Federated Alliance of Greater Canaan, which, within two years had dissolved along a quadraxial Samaritan-Tyrean/Pharisaic-Zealot/Brianist-Sadducaic/Punic Restorationist divide after the Rapprochement Ballot was ignominiously mooted. While some attempted to recreate an anti-Roman union of movements, the Greater Alliance for a Federated Canaan, fœderalist motions were ultimately pushed aside in the unilateral Revolt of the Kanaim of 70.",

In general, prices for coastal areas are only slightly decreasing because the demand for them also only slightly decreases from an ideal economic standpoint. \n\nYou can also think of it from the standpoint of a buyer. Someone buying a house now will naturally inspect it and the surrounding area. They probably have no idea of the history of the place and where the water was years ago. All they see now is (for example) that the beach reaches 200m until it hits the water. Since climate change comes slowly they might not even notice the water creep up to them until it is within much closer proximity (say 50m) over the course of years, depending in which area they are. Only in the last few meters they actually realize what will/could happen and that is when the prices will drop.\n\n & nbsp;\n\nFor the whole \"eye over brain\"-discussion you can look up the [bacteria in a bottle gedankenexperiment](_URL_0_) which works with exponential functions (the natural language of growth) and you can ask yourself how much of it you find \"plausible and natural\".\n\nIt is imo a fitting analogy to energy consumption and population increase which is the main cause for the climate change.",

                "PhD in economics here - prices are based on expectations of future value. If people don't expect the value to fall (i.e. don't believe in climate change/don't think it's serious), the current price will reflect that.\n\nAlso a lot of places (certainly the U.S.) has flood insurance etc. so people don't expect to lose money even if they do see increased flooding.",
                "Several reasons:\n\n1) A sea-level rise of 3-5cm per decade isn't significant to most property values. That can be mitigated by pretty-standard property maintenance. Generally speaking, anyone who buys coastal property as a long-term investment is prepared to maintain it to this level.\n\n2) Property-market prices are heavily influenced by units which turn over quickly. These tend to be higher-priced properties, since people are less inclined to sell properties whose prices are stagnant or falling. \n\n3) The primary risk from sea-level rise isn't the level of the sea, but storm surge. This risk is pretty unpredictable, but coastal areas are generally skilled at mitigating it — for instance, by spreading the risk among many people through property insurance.\n\n4) Most individuals' longest-term horizon for property-owning is a generation or two. Forty years would be a very long horizon. Climate effects just aren't strong enough to reliably affect prices in this term. \n\n5) The main influence on property prices is demand, since as is famously said about real estate: They ain't making any more of it. So as long as a region's population and wealth continue to rise, its property prices will rise. And they will probably rise faster than average at the coast, as long as people tend to value coastal property over inland property.\n\nCalling climate change \"a serious threat\" is kind of like calling an extinction-level asteroid impact or alien invasion \"a serious threat.\" The resulting impacts are devastating, but if you approach the problem rationally then you also have to estimate your likelihood of encountering those devastating impacts — and that usually comes down to your assumptions about the time frame involved. Over the course of a billion years, an extinction-level asteroid's *approach* toward Earth is pretty likely. But in your lifetime, the actual impacts you'll see are likely to be minimal.\n\nAnd the same is probably true for climate change. I doubt you'll see large numbers of people selling coastal property for cents on the dollar in your lifetime. I often tell people that if anyone feels climate-spooked enough to panic-sell at that level now, they should give me a call. But nobody ever does. I guess there is some climate panic out there, but the rationality of the property market remains basically undisturbed for now.\n\nEdit: typo",
                "Flood insurance is Federally backed and does not accurately price in the risk of living in flood prone areas.   Also many of these properties are second homes bought by the rich so the government is less likely to change this status quo.

This is an American answer, not sure about the rest of the world.",
                "Real estate prices are about current demand not long term risk.

Climate change isn’t really a part of the 5-10 year plans, but it’s most definitely part of the 30 year plans. There have been studies showing which states will be affected by climate change the most, and the least, and the clients are paying attention.

Instead of taking a huge loss selling, they get converted into rentals. Alternately the houses just sit in the market for a really long time as people try desperately to get what they paid for the house back.",
                "The simple answer is that it's not imminent.\n\nIt's the exact same reason Houston, Miami, Hawaii, still have valuable property.

                "Because the value of living in a coastal area that will be inundated by flood waters is high enough during all the time that it's NOT inundated by flood waters that demand remains high.  See the NC Outer Banks -- nobody is disputing that those homes will get wrecked by hurricanes eventually but people still build and real estate still sells.\n\nThe Federal Government supports this by offering low priced flood insurance which the Government comes out ahead on because it collects taxes on all the economic activity that is generated by eventually flooded properties meaning it shows a net gain (since the Government doesn't have to make money on insurance premiums to profit)",
                "Because it only affects homes that look at risk.  Most home owners don't instantly go, \"oh that oak tree is going to grow into my septic tank in 15 years\"  or \"maybe a forest fire will burn my house surrounded by woods\" but it still happens and people pay crazy amounts to have a mansion in the woods or too keep that tree that gives the yard character.  They look at the superficial aspect and if it seems in good repair it must be a good house.  I live very near Lake Michigan so I constantly see super expensive homes go up in flood areas that are close to the river and others on the cliffs overlooking the lake.  But we also see the older existing homes being tore down or being sold for less than before because of water damage and erosion.  We have had multiple homes in the area collapse down the hill into the lake.  I suppose they don't hold very much value when the danger is perceived as imminent.  \nA few homes are supported by stilts too keep them from just falling down.  Once all the old houses fall or get tore down new ones (slightly farther back) pop up.",
                "NPR had a great interview last week related to this topic. Can't recall the interviewees name, but he released a book on the history of people living on US coast lines. I'll summarize what I can.\n\nSo, insurance companies learned in the 1920's that it is not economically feasible to make a profit providing flood insurance to coastal homes (floods happen often and cause massive destruction instead of minor damage). Since there was no way to insure oneself against coastal flooding not a lot of development occurred directly on the coast (hotels and other businesses maybe, but not houses).\n\nThen, in the 1960s, LBJ commissioned a study to see if it was viable for the Government to provide some type of Flood Insurance because developers desperately wanted to start building and selling homes directly off the coast. The study found that it would likely be possible to do this if a couple of key rules were followed. First, the premiums had to be really high because its extremely expensive to rebuild/repair after flood damage. Second, there could be NO government subsidies (ie gov't covers part of the expensive premiums) because doing so would not be economically viable (again, price of covering flood damage/destruction is really high).\n\nWelp, the study led to the National Flood Insurance Program, but of course those subsidies the Government shouldn't have allowed? Well they allowed them. So now you have flood insurance on the cheap, which led to a boom of coastal development and purchasing.\n\nSo people kept re-building because they had the insurance to do so and because they could keep affording the premiums, which allowed demand for coastal homes to stay high even though its stupid to do so because floods will likely happen again and destroy the home again. And if demand is high, then home prices will continue to increase.\n\nThe Government now only allows for a home to be rebuilt 3 times, after that they won't cover your expensive premiums (this may be part of the original 1968 legislation, not sure on that). With Climate Change and more flooding, people are hitting that 3rd rebuild quicker than in the past (this is currently happening in places like Houston). So, we are starting to see some instances of people moving away from the coast, because they can't afford to re-build on their own.\n\nSo, why have we not see a drastic drop on coastal home pricing? Its a mix of greed from the private sector and mis-management of a government program. AKA the cause of the majority of issues in the US.  \n\n\n\n\nEDIT: the book is \"Geography of Risk\" by journalist Gilbert M. Gaul",
                "I think this is also a good psychology question. Demand for coastal homes still hasn't dropped, hence why prices haven't dropped. So the question is, why are people still willing to pay premium dollars for a home that years of research has proven to be in an incredibly risky area.\n\nI think you would need to start looking at the psychology of climate denial, apathy, and risk/reward behaviors to get your answer.",
                "The most simple answer is the misinformation campaign has been effective. Energy companies and big business have been spending a fortune to convince people climate change is ‘fear mongering’ as the other commenter put it. And it has been incredibly effective, unfortunately. First off, no one is saying that death is coming tomorrow, this month, this year, or even this decade. What is being talked about is the inter generational responsibility that we have. We should start the work now to reverse the effects of climate change so that future generations aren’t stuck with an irreversible problem. \n\nNow as far as your question, the reason is because the danger is not imminent. Again, it’s years away. And the reason we’re in this mess and having trouble getting out is because of how short sighted humans are. No one thinks about humans 50 years from now because presumably most of us will be dead. Same goes for housing values. No one is thinking what will my house be worth in 50 years, I’ll be dead.\n\nAs we move close to the true danger levels, you’ll start to see a shift of people moving inland. You’ll also see people moving out of hotter climate areas. People will leave Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, places of that nature because the average temps will go up by a few degrees. They will end up Middle East hot and will eventually become unlivable. People will flock to the north and to the Midwest. States along the border of Canada will see a huge influx of new residents. Souther Texas will be abandoned as will most states on the southern border. If there is an increase in average temps of 5-10 degrees, many places there cannot be comfortably lived in.\n\nNow a 10 degree shift is not in the near future. No one alive today will see that increase. But we will see the steady increase of maybe 2-3 degrees during our lifetime.\n\nThis is all assuming that we don’t shift our priorities and start focusing on undoing what’s been done. But even if we do, there will still be an increase in temps in the short term because we’re already on the path. Even if we correct our direction now, there is still going to be a correction period. The change will not be immediate.",
                "People that don’t believe in climate change will have no problem buying in coastal areas because they don’t see it as a threat. It just means that they ( or much more likely their kids) will be screwed when the houses are worth less. But we have already seen some low laying land in Miami areas affected by climate change but it’s like a 7% drop(according to Harvard) there won’t be a run on property.\n\nAlso you should go read an annual report of top US hotel companies in US that have lots of coastal properties. They seem to think it’s risk to their assets.",
                "No capital entity will ever allow profit leakage until the entire asset class is universally abandoned.\n\nWhy is there food wastage? Why do grocery stores dispose of unsold produce? People are always hungry, in fact it breaks the idea of supply/demand: The demand for food is infinite, every person needs food every day. So why is there food waste? Because giving it away or reducing its price reveals that it doesn't have to be sold at the price. You avoid profit leakage to avoid full-on profit annihilation; once people know all the produce is half price in the last hour of business, half price jist becomes *the* price and anyone shopping before the reduction is just paying a fee for convenient shopping hours.\n\nSo why sell a coastal home for half its value? That would just be admitting this thing is gonna *completely* worthless soon and the market won't buy a soon-to-be-worthless asset no matter how big the discount.",
                "There is one other factor that no one else seems to be mentioning. \n\nAlong with flood insurance subsidies from the govt. State and even city level governments are subsiding coastal homes in another way. \n\nBeach replenishment. As climate change moves forward and average temperatures rise we see an increase in the overall frequency and power of storms. Most beaches are not naturally sandy, most are rocky. Costal cities and towns all over the US bring in sand to make the beaches more tourist friendly. However these wide artificial beaches also make for pretty good erosion protection, allowing beach homes over the last 100 year or so to be built much closer than they were historically. \n\n Now with storms being more powerful and frequent they wash away the sand (not natural to the area) faster exposing the houses to erosion risk and the towns to decreased tourism revenue. The towns cities and states then bring in sand to replace the lost beach. The cycle will continue until the cost is to great to replenish the beach, at that point prices will start to tank.\n\n\nPeople are very bad at planning for the future and acting proactively. Usually things need to start falling apart before anyone actually reacts. We are seeing this with climate change now (we've known about it since the start of the industrial revolution) and we will see it with beach properties in the future. Everything will be fine until one day it isn't.",

I know numerous people buying arctic because of climate change. \n\nI don’t recall who, but some group did analysis for next hundred years and mapped results for investors to be able to shift holdings responsibly before the changes happen and make their land worthless and other land a super premium rate. \n\nI should state it’s all hypothesis and speculation based on current data. It might be an over reaction. I know many people who have changed purchases based on the above and other factors.",
                "Because flood insurance is too costly for insurance companies to cover so the government actually covers floods, as disaster relief was becoming too expensive to deal with without insurance. \n\nSo the government has spent lets say $800,000 on a house that's actually worth $100,000, multiple times over, and it's actually a huge problem.

                "I want to point out that the sea won't rise in like a standardized way in every area. Eustatic sea level rise is just the physical \"more water equals higher seas\" way of looking at it. The continents behave like buoyant objects. This buoyancy - \"Isostacy\" - is the effect you will see when ice melts. It's when a part of earth's crust rises due to less of a load on it from, in this case, ice. So you'll see some areas that are still isostatically rebounding from the last ice age rising, while others are inundated with water from eustacy. This is just to explain part of the misconception of how sea level rises (tectonics and local effects also play a part).\n\nNow when it comes to why real-estate prices aren't drastically decreasing... I'm not sure that they aren't. We have systems of levees that keep some areas dry that shouldn't be. But there are places where a single storm event completely leveled a town and took real estate prices from *something* to non-existent (because there was no land to sell).

St. Helens blowing up (people refused to leave, for example) or rattlesnake bites (hold my beer) or climate change (my property is mine).  \n\n\nWe even see examples where I live in Colorado. We've had a rash of bear encounters this last year, and the victim's response is sometimes \"I built my house here, why are they on my property?\". Well, for one, bears mark property by scratching and peeing, not by drawing lines on a map with dollar signs. And two, you left your trash out and the bear found out-- what did you think was going to happen? And yet they insist that this is theirs and seem to be legitimately confused as to why the bear doesn't recognize that. (Some do recognize it, but a surprising number do not-- much to my amazement). Anyway, same thing with climate change. In their mind, the human went through all the right steps to earn money and purchase the property, and the weather will somehow (magically) understand and respect that.  \n\n\nAs a last example I am reminded of King Canut, yes, he is real.

He felt that the property and risk markets are so far out of equilibrium that it would be unwise to place bets on sea level rise impacts, yet. By simply extrapolating the mean sea level rise and predictable ocean tides, you could quite reliably predict \"sunny day\" flood events in Annapolis, Md, and you could probably make a reasonably accurate prediction of the added economic costs related to this kind of flooding, but to make money off of this you would be betting against an opponent with effectively infinite resources to mitigate short-term losses.\n\nInvestors with sufficient resources are likely placing long-term bets, but they probably won't pay off for another 20 to 50 yrs.

So while we are advising almost complete red zoning of the coastline nothing is done at a political level.\n\nPeople are still building on the coast because the zoning is for residential, so they assume why not, if it floods it's the governments fault for not telling me and they will pay.",

                "Because most people don’t take it seriously or don’t want to take it seriously. Myself on the other hand who has built my little empire in S. Florida is planning ahead. First reason is because I want to leave my kids something. I won’t see the land flooded but they might. They say the Florida Keys will mostly be gone in just 50-60 years. When prices crash all my work will have been for nothing.\n\nSecond reason is to beat the land rush. Once the majority of people get it, then things will happen quickly I’m afraid. Also, you only mentioned shore prices going down but inland  prices will go up. I bought a. Outlet acres cheap in N. Georgia and plan to add to it. 10 years till retirement and I want all my Florida property gone by then. Pack up and leave, course, can still visit in Winter!",
                "Simply put, people don’t price that far into the future. The beach front homes in the USA still have at least ten years of being awesome, so the prices will stay high. When it starts going downhill, prices will drop. \n\nYour argument is similar to someone saying you shouldn’t buy a PS4 because a PS5 is coming. And that you should skip the PS5 too. Eventually you’re just missing out entirely, or you gotta get in the game. (PS being the different generations of Playstation video game consoles.)"

Rich enough to want their children educated, poor enough that hiring a private tutor was beyond them. So some enterprising teachers set up \"public\" schools where these middle class families could send their children if they had the money.\n\nThese schools did pretty well and educated a bunch of guys who became successful.

",
                "The chance for birth defects in inbreeding animals is exactly the same as with humans. It's simply that they do not show as much. Many inbreeding problems are associated with less intelligence or malformity. Now in an animal you seldom will know when one is a little bit less intelligent than another. Also body deformity does not always show so well in animals. There are goats herds in south america where the offspring isn't separated thus inbreeds. There are many goats with 4 horns instead of 2. ",
                "There aren't that many defects if siblings breed. Over several generations things can get messy though. ",
                "There are also lethal mutations. It's not uncommon for an embryo to die very early development. \n\nEveryone has some embryonic lethal mutations. If you mate with a sibling, theres a high probability you have some of the same lethal mutations. If the embryo inherits the same lethal from both parents - bye bye. Don't see it. \n\nI can't agree or disagree with the claim that animals don't suffer from inbreeding to the same extent. My reasoning can't support that claim. Inbreeding is devastating to small populations. ",
                "Natural selection is more ruthless in the animal kingdom. Bad genes are weeded out more effectively",
                "Yeah if you've got defects in the animal kingdom then you're on your own... and not for very long ",
                "Inbreeding is just as much of a problem for animals. So much so that many species have evolved methods of avoiding it, such as males leaving the areas where they were born while their sisters stay closer to home. In endangered species, where populations may be very small, you often see signs of \"inbreeding depression\" - lowered survival and reproductive ability due to a lack of genetic diversity.\n\nInbreeding is also a huge concern for zoos, with their small captive populations. Zoos keep pedigrees for lot of species bred in captivity, so they can avoid breeding related individuals with each other.\n\nYou can see the consequences in pets if you think of purebred dogs, for example. Many dog breeds are likely to get specific medical issues, such as hip dysplasia in golden retrievers, due to many generations of inbreeding.\n",
                "One reason is because nature clears out those with major defects pretty quick. Though in Boulder, CO there was a group of deer near the outskirts that was interbreeding for awhile and they started getting goofy, like running into traffic, and also had defects, like one sided antlers. ",
                "White tigers aren't naturally occuring in nature and the only way to get the white fur is through inbreeding, so a lot of white tigers are affected with club foot, and other issues, I know that they can get downs syndrome as well, but im not sure if thats a result of being inbred.\n",
                "1. Animal inbreeding is also bad\n\n2. The likelihood of defects from inbreeding is lower than people think. One generation of inbreeding only slightly increases the chances. Regular inbreeding over many generations is what really causes problems\n\n3. Animals with birth defects are unlikely to survive and be observed, while most humans can be kept alive",
                "There really *isn't* that high a chance of birth defects when humans produce offspring with siblings.  It's several generations of repeated incest where high rates of birth defects start to pop up. \n\nAlso, animal defects would likely be either inconsequential or bring early death.  Extra finger on a kid, we'd see it.  Extra toe on a paw, so?  A deaf or blind animal isn't going to last too long in the wild.",
                "Humans, in general, are quite inbred due to some catastrophic event that occurred 75,000 years ago (toba eruption possibly).\n\nIf you compared the similarities between people within our own population, to similarities in other species  population, you would find we don't have near the same genetic diversity.\n\nWe know this because of mDNA, that is DNA that is only passed down to you by your mother. We can calculate the average rate of genetic mutation (in mDNA) and infer from this that every human on earth has descended from as few as 10000 humans that survived this event. \n\nThere's even a mitochondrial \"eve\" so to speak.\n\nTLDR: Humans are pretty inbred, compared to other species. Inbreeding leads to loss of genetic variation. Loss of genetic variation leads to unbenificial mutations in our DNA propogating. Which is why inbreeding in humans is not the same as in animals."

It's not always used, but if it is then the autopilot would likely be in control of the plane from a few moments after take-off all the way to the moment all the wheels are on the ground. Humans are responsible for everything else, from the outside safety inspection of the plane to starting the engines, taxiing the airplane to the runway and taking off.\n\nThat said, the autopilots don't handle failures very well. If the instruments feeding information to them stop working or any of their consistency tests fail, they produce an alarm and relinquish control of the plane. For the auto-land thing above (at least on some models of airplane) BOTH autopilots need to be activated and if they start disagreeing about what to do then auto-land is aborted.\n\nWhen in doubt, the human is the last line of defence against malfunctions. Also robots can't talk to Air Traffic Control yet. :)",

The refugees from Troy were mostly embattled heroes and warriors, not the dregs of society.\n\n >  why were they unashamed of their origin story?\n\nBecause it was *true*.\n\nI think that, far from the Romans portraying themselves unflatteringly, *you're* the one who's gone to extreme lengths to highlight (and invent?) the bad parts of their origin story. Their version was a lot more balanced, and showed a lot more triumph over adversity, and positivity, than your version.\n",

Second: I worry that you're projecting modern views about how an origins myth ought to be sanitized, glorious, and ennobling. Most Greco-Roman myths are not the best places to look for a good moral or uplifting message--foundation myths or otherwise.\n\nPerhaps the more interesting question here is why we think myths should have a 'positive' message (whatever that means) and why the Romans were ok with the moral ambiguities inherent in their origins stories in a way that we are not.

                "Lab mice are almost all 100% inbred already; it's impossible to inbreed them any further.  \n\nThe whole point about using (most strains of) lab mice is that they're genetically identical to each other.  If you have one male BALB/c mouse in your lab in Boston, it should be exactly the same (genetically) as the male BALB/c mouse in a lab in Japan, and in the lab in Jackson Harbor, Maine, and in Brazil and Germany.\n\nHow do you make sure that mice are genetically identical? You inbreed them until there's no more variation in them.  There's a Wikipedia article on [inbred strains of mice and rats](_URL_0_) which in turn links to methods of generating inbred genetically identical mice: [Backcrossing](_URL_2_), [line breeding](_URL_3_), and so on.\n\nDoes this mean that mice have genetic defects due to inbreeding? Sure. In some cases, those turn out to be useful for researching genetic defects. In other cases, they're just something researchers work around, or maybe ignore. But remember that \"defect\" is relative. A domestic cow that is optimal for a farmer has horrible genetic defects as a wild animal; an aurochs would have horrible genetic defects as a domestic cow.  Lab mice are kept in cages in temperature- and humidity-controlled environments all their life; \"defects\" have to be considered in that context.\n\nFinally, all of this is a little theoretical. Spontaneous mutations are common enough that, technically, no two mice are going to be genetically identical -- they'll have a dozen, or dozens of, unique mutations. [Epigenetic differences](_URL_1_) also affect them. \n\nBut as far as inbreeding is concerned, it's a feature, not a bug. ",

It is possible to deliberately induce mutations in the 'standard' animals and look for changes that approximate human disease.

Land animals adapted their eyes from their aquatic origins including sensitivity to colors other than green and blue which are transmitted in water where red is absorbed, as well as changes to lens design, the aqueous humors that fill our eye, and blocking of UV light and protection of the pigments and cells in the eye from oxidative and environmental damage. \n\n"

                " >  It is hardly disputed that in the whole vast literature of witchcraft, the most prominent, the most important, the most authoritative volume is the *Malleus Maleficarum (The Witch Hammer)* of Heinrich Kramer (Henricus Institoris) and James Sprenger. The date of the first edition of the *Malleus* cannot be fixed with absolute certainty, but the likeliest year is 1486. There were, at any rate, fourteen editions between 1487 and 1520, and at least sixteen editions between 1574 and 1669. These were issued from the leading German, French and Italian presses. The latest reprint of the original text of the *Malleus* is to be found in the noble four volume collection of Treatises on Witchcraft, \"sumptibus Claudii Bourgeat\", 4to., Lyons, 1669. There is a German translation by J. W. R. Schmidt, *Der Hexenhammer*, 3 vols, Berlin, 1906; second edition, 1922-3. There is also an English translation with Introduction, Bibliography, and Notes by Montague Summers, published John Rodker, 1928. [...] In fact, \"it fastened on European jurisprudence for nearly three centuries the duty of combating\" the Society of Witches. The *Malleus* lay on the bench of every judge, on the desk of every magistrate. It was the ultimate, irrefutable, unarguable authority. It was implicitly accepted not only by Catholic but by Protestant literature. In fine, it is not too much to say that the *Malleus Maleficarum* is among the most important, wisest, and weightiest books of the world.\n\n- Montague Summers, introduction to the [1948 edition](_URL_1_).\n\nYou have to take Summers with a grain of salt: while extremely erudite in the subject of the occult, the Reverend's actual belief and tendency toward exaltation of occult literature can skew the perception of facts a little. Nevertheless, it does emphasize that the *Malleus* was extraordinarily popular, and for an extensive period of time. A lot of this had to do with utility and demand.\n\nIf you look at the volumes available to authorities on witchcraft in the period, you have works like Johannes Nider's *Formicarius* (1475); while this was popular and helped define the image and concept of the witch as we know it, this work was not geared toward either a lay audience or legal use since it was quite literally written as a teacher-student dialogue on the lives of ants. The section on witchcraft was actually absorbed into the *Malleus*.\n\nAnd authorities at the period *needed* a work on heresy and witchcraft. Civil courts and authorities were under greater pressure to work with ecclesiastic courts and authorities to address both heresy and *maleficium*, and the framework of Roman Law which was highly influential on the courts of Europe required a certain amount of legalistic wrangling to deal with the contemporary issues of witchcraft. While the Protestant Reformation had not yet occurred, there were still schisms within the church, which inquisitors rooted out as heresy. H. R. Trevor-Roper in [The European Witch-Craze of the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries](_URL_0_) writes:\n\n >  When the Dominicans pressed for inquisitorial power over witchcraft, the papacy had at first resisted. The old canons of the Church, and particularly the *canon Episcopi*, denied the reality of witches and forbade their persecution. Therefore, in 1257, Pope Alexander IV had refused these demands unless manifest heresy, not merely witchcraft, could be proved. But little by little, under constant pressure, the papacy had yielded.  The great surrender had been made by the French popes of Avignon, and particularly by the two popes from southern France, John XXII and his successor Benedict XII, who had already, as bishops in Languedoc, waged war on nonconformity in the old Albigensian and Vaudois areas. John XXII, who declared heretical the Franciscan doctrine of the poverity of Christ (so dangerously akin to the old Vaudois ideas), also, by his constitution *Super illius specula* of 1325, authorized he full use of inquisitorial procedure against witches, of who he lived in personal terror. For the next century and a half--until the Witch Bull of Innocent VIII, and indeed afterwards--the main effort of the inquisitors (although there were some spectacular 'political' witchcraft trials in France, Burgundy and England) had been directed against the witches of the Alps and the Pyrenees.\n\nSummers gives a good run-down of some of the \"political\" witchcraft trials in his introduction to the *Malleus*; sorcery was effectively the civil counterpart to the ecclesiastical charge of heresy, and civil authorities could actually pass mortal sentences, which ecclesiastical courts could not--this was the standard inquisitorial practice, to hand over heretics to secular authorities for further persecution and punishment. This practice applied to all cases before the inquisition, not just the political ones, so as the *scope* of the inquisition expanded to include witchcraft, the need by civil authorities to address the question of witchcraft expanded as well. This brings us to Pope Innocent VIII, who in 1484:\n\n >  [...] issued *Summis desiderantes* at the request of two Dominican inquisitors, Heinrich Kramer (or Institoris) and Jacob Sprenger, who had worked in southern Germany and encountered some resistance in their search for heretics. The Bull formally removes all impediments to the completion of Kramer and Sprenger's mission.\n\n- Edward Peters, [The Magician, The Witch, and the Law](_URL_2_), 170\n\nPeters goes on to note that the Papal bull was not, in itself, remarkable - previous popes had issued bulls with much the same language and for much the same purpose, to authorize members of the clergy and clear away local opposition. However, two years after it was issue, it was included as the preface to the *Malleus Maleficarum* - a text Innocent himself had probably never seen - and in that context, being bundled with the book, gave the book greater authority, beyond even the area of Germany which most concerned the inquisitors. This in part helped its transmission, but the other part is the nature of the book itself. Peters 173-174:\n\n >  All scholars agree that the form of the work, that of a series of scholastic *quaestiones*, derives from handbooks for inquisitors, of which Eymeric's is the best example. Within the framework of *quaestiones* arranged into three major parts, owever, the work is intellectually inferior to Eymeric's and hardly to be considered \"scholastic\" in the original sense of that term at all. What is striking about the *Malleus* is its economic use of the *quaestio* form to bring together elements from all of the diverse sources that had provided elements of the new fifteenth-century beliefs in magic in the first place. The juxtaposition of these elements in a single, concentrated, tightly argued treatise of considerably greater length than any earlier work really constituted the basis of the popularity of the *Malleus* during the next two centuries. [...] In no other work are theology and law so tightly linked. Even if, as I have suggested above, the *Malleus* made no discernible impact on the prosecution of magicians and witches for nearly half a century, no comparable work approached its comprehensiveness until those of Bodin and Remy, Del Rio and Boguet, at the end of the sixteenth century.\n\nThe *Malleus* was not alone in its generation. Writings about witchcraft, even printed works, were extensive, with titles like *Tractatus contra Daemonum Invocatores* (1450) by Jean Vinet, *Fortalicium fidei contra fidei christianae hostes* (1467) by Alfonso de Spina, *Flagellum Maleficorum* (c.1490) by Petrus Mamoris. The *Laienspiegel* (1509) by Ulrich Tengler in particular was incredibly popular, because like the *Malleus* it was a legal work looking at the different aspects of witchcraft in regard to private, public, and criminal law; it went through fourteen editions. But the *Malleus* was uniquely suited to spread, because of its relatively early date, because it was organized in a manner useful to legal authorities, and because the spread of the printing press made it much more accessible to this ready market that was in demand for such a way. Judges and magistrates required a legal text for dealing with the problems posed by accusations of sorcery and heresy, and the *Malleus* was almost encyclopedic compared to other contemporary texts.\n\nThis, combined with the popularity of the *Malleus* and its relative accessibility also made it something of an authority on witchcraft which many subsequent demonologists would refer to, quote from, or cite as a reference; a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy where a book is popular because it is known to be popular. While there is a popular rumor that it was banned by the Church and placed on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum, I haven't been able to confirm that with any of my sources at hand. ",
                "In addition, who was printing it? I feel like the church would have had a bigger issue with people printing it and making it available for sale than with people buying it. ",
                "As a follow-up, due to the expense of books, was there much fiction published during these periods? If not, I can imagine it being bought for entertainment purposes - the world's first fantasy novel, in other words. Weren't fairy tales primarily oral?",
                "While it's true that the Church maintained a broadly cautious attitude toward witch hunting, it was not the clergy that the *Malleus* was aimed at. Instead, Kramer attempted to promote his book among secular lords, princes, courts and town councils. Indeed, one of the central points of the book was that, due the exceptional nature of their crimes, witches should be prosecuted by secular authorities. As no full vernacular edition of the *Malleus* was ever published, its readership was restricted to only the most educated classes - chiefly lawyers and theologians.\n\nKramer himself seems to have been something of an anathema in his own time. The 'senile' comment came from Bishop Golser of Tyrol, who had resisted Kramer's attempts to foment a brutal witch persecution in Innsbrook and had him expelled from his diocese under threat of physical violence a year before the *Malleus* was published. We do not know of a single witch being condemned in Tyrol following this affair. After the publication of the *Malleus*, Ulrich Molitor, a lawyer who had worked as an official at Innsbrook, penned a critique of Kramer's views that was republished more times throughout the 1490s than the *Malleus* itself. Kramer himself was ridiculed by Erasmus of Rotterdam in the satirical *Praise of Folly*, and labelled a drunkard by the humanist Konrad Peutinger. As such, 'widespread acceptance' may be something of an exaggeration.\n\nNevertheless, by the time the *Malleus* was published, anxieties about witchcraft were already on the rise, with early witch trials beginning to take place in several European jurisdictions. As a demonological work, the book actually offered little in the way of new ideas, but as a self-purported definitive guide for the handling of witchcraft cases, the book suited the needs of judges and lawyers perfectly. The extent to which the *Malleus* directly influenced the spread of witch hysteria is still debated, but it seems likely that the book owed much of its popularity to pre-existing fears. The *Malleus* also received a wider audience amongst secular rulers who harboured a personal interest in the subject of witchcraft or were simply drawn to the novelty of such a text."

That would explain why OP effectively has one voice for German, and a slightly different one for English. It's just his vocal system being more efficient. \n\nI'm imagining something like a 'vocal posture', where a speaker holds his vocal apparatus in a particular way, in preparation for efficiently making specific types of sounds. (Bit like a dancer or a martial artist with their stances.) Anecdotally, I notice that the sounds of the Indian languages I speak feel much looser than English, which feels much more clipped and precise. German gives a similar feeling to English, while Spanish or Italian seem to be relatively loose in comparison. ",
                "I have a masters in theoretical linguistics and did my dissertation on language acquisition, so I'll offer what I know from that perspective.\n\nEvery language has a difference in *tone* and *pitch*. German speakers speak with a higher pitch than English. Similarly, Italians speak with a higher pitch than Spanish speakers. When we learn a language, we pick up on many different things subconsciously- like tone, accent, and idiomatic usage. I assume you learned English by supplementing grammar with native usage. A real world example of this is listening to Germans who learned English later in life grammatically. They'll speak English at a slightly higher pitch than native English speakers. Also, their tonal pronunciation will be slightly off.\n\nYou just happened to pick up the natural pitch of English. I hope this makes sense.",
                "I'll answer the best I can as someone who studied Linguistics for years (with a focus on accent/dialect work).\n\nEach language or dialect obviously operates around a specific set of rules. For example, those in the south U.S. can sound lazier and flatter while New England dwellers can sound rushed or sharp. Each language comes with it's own pitch and ability to emphasize.\n\nThe most famous example of pitch change would be analyzing the Americans and the English. Americans get louder when they mean something or get angry, whereas the English use the pitch of the speech to emphasize importance. (In other words, watch them yell on SNL and watch them get high pitched voices on Monty Python).\n\nThese are cultural identifiers dealing with pitch, volume, speed etc. Spanish languages often naturally speak much faster (words per second) than English speakers, who speak faster than most Scandinavian citizens. \n\nTo answer your question: German is a more laborious language to speak, (more muscles used to make the sounds, etc) and this could lead to the dropping of pitch (as well as any cultural influence).",

                "Time to shine: \n\nMyographies allow us to see the tension in the muscles involved in the phonation process. \nI have seen cases in which informants speaking in my mother tongue showed in their mother tongue (Spanish) a much higher tension than when they were speaking in English.\nEnglish speakers (Native and non native) show lower levels of myological activity in their vocal tract. \n\nI am a Linguistics student (specialized in Experimental Phonetics) that has worked in a phonetics laboratory for 3 years doing research on Laryngectomized patients Speech."

After they log in, Salesforce redirects the browser to whatever url my app wants. The problem is that my app is not a website, it's an exe running on the user's computer. So how would the web browser open a url in my app?\n\nSimple. My app is running a micro-webserver on some random port. So the url my app tells Salesforce to call back when login is successful is something like \"_URL_0_\".\n\nNow, if you know anything about networking, you'll be asking \"Wait, wouldn't that just tell Salesforce to call Salesforce?\" Nope. The url is called from the browser on the local machine and it sends the request to the local machine which is picked up by my app. It's really damn handy, so long as the OAuth2 provider allows it. (Facebook doesn't, Salesforce does.)\n\nSo basically, the website's Javascript sends a request to \"_URL_1_[some port number\\]\" and does different things based on the response (or lack of response). If the app is installed, it can respond to the request. If the app is not installed, there's no response and the website can detect this.\n\nEdit: .Net developers who are more interested in this: Google \"_URL_2_.httplistener\""

It's kind of like the Loch Ness monster in Scotland, most Scots don't honestly believe it exists but as long as tourists come and take pictures, have a good time and buy souvenirs everybody is happy. That Elf School you talk about is more of a tourist trap if anything, I'm not gonna bash it since it's cool that tourists can learn about Icelandic folklore as it can be very fascinating, but it's not based in actual academia. There have been some cases of roads swaying around rocks where reportedly elves live, but that's more about preserving Icelandic literary tradition than actually worrying about the well-being of said mythical beings. Iceland doesn't really have many historical sites because natural phenomena like earthquakes and volcanoes have consistently destroyed them (plus, not many events of historical importance have happened in Iceland, honestly) and until the 20th century people lived in houses [like this](_URL_2_), not built to last for hundreds of years obviously. So the \"historical\" sites of Iceland are usually rooted in the [sagas](_URL_1_) or folklore. So if a certain cliff is mentioned in a folk story that is supposed be a troll that turned to stone (they turn to stone when exposed to sunlight), people want to preserve that cliff and visit it and go \"hey, there's the troll\" but don't actually believe that it was literally a troll once. Same goes with rocks supposedly inhabited by elves. It's just nice to keep them around if possible.\n\nNow, I'm not saying that NO ONE believes in elves. There are kooky people everywhere in the world that believe in ghosts, myths and new age mumbo jumbo but a belief in elves does not play a role in daily life in Iceland and is really much more noticeable for tourists than the locals. I've always found it interesting how the myth of the elves, has lived on until the present day when there are so many other creatures from Icelandic folklore that don't get talked about much. Like the [skoffín](_URL_4_), [urðarköttur](_URL_3_) or the ever sneaky [marbendill](_URL_0_), you don't want him to get you while rowing your boat. Maybe it's because the elves are beautiful and pure while most of the other mythical beings are creepy as fuck."

If you see enough ads for VISA when you go to get a credit card you think 'hmm VISA seems pretty big, maybe I should get  VISA'.  Or you want a soft drink and think 'hmmm coke seems pretty popular'. \n\nWith google you pay to be top of the list in search rankings (this is an auction process, so highest bidder for a given search term gets the top spot).  On facebook you pay to show up in the feed or on the strip on the right.  \n\nSome of the companies who you see advertising have basically no business, and no money, but for a few thousand dollars in advertising they can get a few tens of thousands in business.  The perks of large data sets.  If only one in a million people buy something but you are advertising to 900 million people well, you have 900 customers.  The price is then a matter of cheap enough to justify whatever the number actually is.  ",

It's still done today, but mostly for aesthetic purposes.\n- For Greek Fire no composition was passed down, but we can get the same effects using Napalm.",
                "Because we don't try to, because we can do better stuff today. We do not need their exact recipes/methods, because we do it better.\n\nOur concretes is plenty good enough, our munitions are way more powerful than Greek fire and Damascus steel was simply a way to compensate for crappy raw material and uneven heating.",
                "It's not that we can't reproduce them technologically, it's that the exact method or recipe was lost to history, so we can't make the exact same thing.\n\n & #x200B;\n\nTake the roman concrete. If you look at a map of Volcanoes in Europe you will see that there is barely any. There is some on Greek Island, but the only concentrations on mainland are in Italy or in Turkey. That's the key to the Roman concrete, because it's a natural concrete using volcanic ash. Something that you can't really do in most of the rest of the world, because of the lack of volcanoes. Concrete today is artificial, meaning we use rocks and minerals that we find pretty much everywhere and use an process of heating to transform it into Portland concrete. It's not as good as Roman concrete, but you can do it anywhere in any quantity, while roman concrete can only be made from Volcanic Ash that is limited geographically and in quantity. The exact recipe of the Roman concrete isn't known, but we figure out the Ash thing and today we use those and other additive that we discovered since then to make really good concrete. Today we can make better concrete than the Roman, but we can also make lesser concrete that is cheaper and allow you to make more building. We make the concrete we need, while Roman only had the choice of volcanic ash concrete.\n\n & #x200B;\n\nFor Greek fire, we have only some description of it, but we don't know what it was exactly. There is some theories about what was the composition, but what is for sure, our current Napalm is way more effective than Greek Fire was. We also most like know how to make Greek Fire, we simply don't know if it is Greek fire or not. For example, some think that Greek Fire was saltpetre, which would make Greet Fire some early gunpowder weapon. We know how to make that and we make it better, but we don't know if Greek Fire really was saltpetre or something else.\n\n & #x200B;\n\nWe have a similar situation for Damascus Steel. We can do better steel today, but Damascus Steel was some damn good steel for their time. It took centuries until modern metallurgy was able to create steel as good and eventually better. The exact method is lost to history, but several reverse engineering were done over the year and those gave pretty good damn steel too. We just don't know if any of them are really the same as the one use for Damascus Steel. In addition, most our steel today is for construction and so we make the cheapest steel possible for what we need, so yes Damascus steel is stronger than our average construction steel today, but that's not the only type of steel we can make.\n\n & #x200B;\n\nThere is a lot of romanticisation of those old material from the past. Truth is most of their fame come from the fact that we lost their method to history and if we really know what the recipe was, we barely would use it outside of some novelty items and certainly not on a large scale.",
                "Because recipes have to be almost exactly followed to the letter to the slightest detail for them to produce equal results every time.\nFor example, cooking. There are differences in the ways that everyone cooks eggs or steaks and they are noticeable, even if they were following the same recipe all the time. Sure, there are better or worse recipes or methods but it would not be \"that\" recipe. \n\nThe case of the previous materials is that the were made with specific tools, methods \"handmade\"and materials specific to that era and because the materials were or methods were not specified, we cant replicate it with exactitude nowadays, not even with machines. \n\nAlthough we cant replicate it, we can make do similar products or even better stuff. For example,  nowadays instead of greek fire, we have thermite,  and molotov cocktails, (gasoline and oil), and napalm, all used in war.\n\nI conclude my post saying that because of dire needs,  we did not had time to replicate and search for lost recipes and had to make do with what we had in hand.

                "Well this all depends on when and where you are talking about.  I imagine the answer would be significantly different for Ancient China as opposed to Ancient Rome, which would in turn be different from Ancient Mexico.  Given how broad the topic can be, I'm going to just provide a small snippet of how vigilante justice operated in a specific time and place before professional police forces existed.  \n\nFor example in Anglo-Saxon England, which is admittedly stretching the definition of ancient, vigilantism was more or less the \"default\" of conflict resolution between equal members of society.  There was no real distinction between vigilante justice and \"official\" justice.  Especially in the Early Anglo-Saxon period our ideas of objective justice and an independent judiciary/police force just simply did not exist.  Justice and revenge were extremely interlinked and the line between official prosecution and a lord taking justice \"into his own hands\" was significantly blurrier than we might imagine.  Much scholarly ink has been spilled on the role of kings and their royal law codes in attempting to crack down on the feuds and disputes of their subjects.  There has been a long standing assumption int he field that the Anglo-Saxon kings were moving in the direction of centralization of power and an increasing monopoly on the prosecution of wrong doers, taking power out of the hands of rival lords who would rather their disputes be settled among themselves.  While this view is somewhat teleological, it is somewhat true in the broad strokes.  \n\nFor certain crimes this was not necessarily the trend.  Catching thieves in the act of theft, or chasing them down, was a devolved power, and very little \"official\" input was required for executing thieves, especially repeat offenders, from the time of England's unification onward.  Other transgressions were different.  There were numerous restrictions and exceptions and possible outcomes for murder for example.  There could be any number of mitigating circumstances that would lessen the fine/penalty/penance paid for the crime such as whether the person murdered had harmed their murderer's relatives.  But all of these permutations were still far removed from a centralized approach that royal figures might have wanted to implement.  \n\nMany scholars argue that the early Anglo-Saxon law codes were essentially efforts by the kings to preempt the cycles of feud and revenge that would result from transgressions by insisting on a royal presence in the paying of weregild, the amount of payment due to a slighted party.  Many law codes provide for the involvement of royally appointed figures in the legal process, but this is misleading.  Although royal law codes make provisions for reeves and sheriffs, we should not associate these figures with out later understandings of law enforcement.  These figures were not necessarily a proto-police force as the name sherriff might imply, but instead royally appointed figures, or people acting under the auspices of royal authority, but in practice there seems to have been little effort at ensuring their objectivity.  indeed Lambert posits that often in the case of a lord or other prominent figure that had committed a crime, the only person in the area who would be capable of putting together a force capable of executing justice on them was another lord, not the king's representatives.  Later on in the Anglo-Saxon period, other practices such as banishment, ordeals, penance, and executions would come to play an increasing role in the prosecution of wrongdoing.  But none of these ever really rose to the level of a police force, indeed Thomas Lambert points out that often times it was the aggrieved party acting on the orders of the royal figures (or claiming to), making this a system of legitimized vigilantism.  Lambert concludes that over time the Anglo-Saxon kings were able to supersede the rights claimed by feud prone lords, but this was a long and involved process that was only somewhat complete by the time of the Norman conquest."

                "There are a couple of things going on here.  It's a very complex problem and I can only gesture at elements of it. \n\n1. Germany has gotten a lot of bad press lately for its EU politics, in which it has been playing bad cop during the Greece debacle.  Taking in refugees is an astoundingly good PR move.\n\n2. Germany actually can take in refugees. It has a uniquely strong economy in a Europe still recovering from massive economic turmoil and its market and welfare state can absorb them.\n\n3. Germany actually *needs* new blood.  Germans do not replace themselves in sufficient numbers (get boning, Germans, seriously. What are you, pandas?) and the country has long relied on guestworkers to supply necessary labour.  Its welfare state and pension plans will be truly messed up if they don't keep bringing in immigrants.\n\n4. Because of Germany's terrible history, the country does feel a moral obligation to do better--and so there actually is political will to take them in. \n\nEdit: Thanks so much for the gold! I'm going to go gift an equivalent amount (and then some) to a charity that looks after refugees or Syrian War victims. Any preferred suggestions?\n\nEdit 2: I'll be making a donation to the [International Rescue Committee](_URL_0_). It was founded Germans, including Albert Einstein, during one of the country's darkest years and so feel's kind of appropriate. The IRC has been helping refugees and victims of war and instability ever since.  I hope some of you fine folks donate, too. Thanks /u/ImOnTheLoo for the suggestion. ",
                "tl;dr answer: Money.

They are also really good about teaching skilled labor, something the US needs to replicate.",
                "German here - another point which hasn't been mentioned: \n\nThe Neo-Nazi Right is growing at an alarming rate in Germany, anti-immigrant marches are on the up, and an abhorrent number of arson attacks have been made on temporary housing for asylum seekers, with some even leading to refugee fatalities. \n\nThe vast majority of German's are terrified by this development, and there is a general sentiment that the Right's increasing efforts need to be matched and overpowered by the less-shitty people. There is a general feeling that a point needs to be made about the kind of country that Germany is now, and the kind of ideas we represent. ",
                "You have some good explanations regarding why Germany are so welcoming, the reason why some other countries are so hostile hasn't been mentioned.\n\nMost European countries have a large capacity to take in refugees, the hostility is largely political. The more right-wing parties are doing the usual thing of placing all the ills of their societies at the feet of migrants. Refugees aren't coming to Europe to escape they're just here for a free handout. \n\nIt's similar to Donald Trumps stupid remarks about Mexicans being drug mules and rapists. It creates an \"us v them\" mentality that panders to a certain demographic that enjoys a less analytical approach to reality.",
                "I can tell you why we, Poland, do not want to take any \"refugees\", it is because:\n\n* Most of them don't have any documents/id, you can't tell if certain person is really a refugee from war zone, economic migrant, or hidden ISIS terrorist\n\n* Because we simply don't have money - millions of Poles live below standard of poor, often hungry, saving on everything.\n\n* Because most of those \"refugees\" dont want to go to Poland anyway, they know they will get a lot more social benefits in Germany/Other countries than in Poland. In Poland they receive little and they need to hard work to get more. About 95% refugees with asylium in Poland escaping to other countries like Sweden.\n\n* Because we dont owe them anything, Poland never had any colonies in Africa or anywhere else, we never enslaved Black people (even more - we helped them getting free from French occupation in Napolean times in Haiti: _URL_0_). Wester Europe did such things, if they feel obligated to help those ppl - allright, but we dont have any moral debt to them.\n\n* Becuse we want to protect our cultural heritage. Muslim families has avg. 5 kids, while Polish - 1,3. It's pretty similar in rest of EU countries. By taking so much immigrants, Germany (also France and Sweden) will become muslim country in the next 20-30 years. There is danger that Islamic Sharia Law will replace democracy when they finally become majority in 20-30 years, which means for ex.: no free elections, no beer in the park, no womens behind the wheel, and head cutted off if you insult their prophet. We simply don't want that in Poland.\n\nI hope it helps understand our attitude, and sorry for my bad english.",

It's the only time in my entire life living in Canada that I was the victim of random street violence.\n\nSo I can understand their reservations.\n\nAt the same time as living in \"Little Lebanon\", I had a few good friends who were Arabic, but they were what you could call \"normal\" immigrants from Lebanon and Jordan.\n\nThey applied, had educations, job prospects, money saved up, they were prepared for the move and made a smooth transition. I've also had personal and professional relationships with immigrants from Ethiopia and Haiti.\n\nThe difference between the immigrant versus refugee interactions was staggering. I don't have the answers to how to solve the problem, but I do understand people's reservations behind taking refugees in to their own back yard.",

In Switzerland, gun laws explicitly contain a list of nationalities that are not allowed to own firearms, just like that, zero fucks given whether that's discrimination or not.",

                "As a European (British) I'm getting more concerned with immigration.  I'd consider myself a pretty liberal guy, but even I can admit that it's no accident that more and more people in Europe are growing uneasy with taking in refugees/migrants.  For me personally, it has to do with religion and cultural differences.  There are large Muslim communities in the UK that seem totally separated from the rest of society.  It's almost like they live in their own country within a country.  They are having a lot more children and their population is growing at quite an alarming rate.  They go to all-Muslim schools, or even worse \"Faith Schools\" that teach what they want to teach, often things that are at odds with a western democratic society.  What we're getting is an ever widening segregation between the British public and the Muslim communities.  This is breeding a lot of unrest, fear and conflict.  A lot of mistakes have been made in Europe in regards to this issue and it's only going to get worse.  There will be a breaking point.  \n\nFor what it's worth, I'm not in any way anti-immigration, and I would be supportive towards taking in refugees, BUT ONLY IF once they get here they were put into social programs that would help them integrate fully within British society instead of forming isolated communities which would only make the current problem worse.

However, the majority also believes, that people who are in immidiate danger, like being in a war area need to be protected.\n\nThe pictures and videos you see, where people cheer that refugees arrive, just represent a small portion of German people. I do not have a problem with this, everyone can do whatever he likes, but I see problems with the message this send to other refugees (together with Merkels statements).\n\nIt is a fact that the majority of the refugees coming here, will never integrate and will never be economically independent from social welfare. Also, Germany is an expensive country, so even if they get 400 Euros per months, they cannot save so much (legally) that it really worth for them being here instead of other European countries. SO eventually the expectations they have when seeing those welcoming people and politicians are not the reality.",

                "It could also have to do with the Dublin regulation. The [Dublin Regulation](_URL_0_) forces refugees to stay in the country that they land in, however it has currently been suspended. Because Germany is not a border country with any of countries the immigrants are migrating from, they can currently take more immigrants. Mix this with Germany having one of the strongest economies in the EU and it makes them one of the best suited to help in the crisis. Countries like Greece have been hit hard, seeing a 50% increase in the illegal border crossings in the last year. Germany also has better Immigration facilities. They are better equipped to handle large groups of immigrants. Have better systems to differentiate between who is an economic immigrant and who is a refugee seeking asylum. Countries like Greece and Hungary are facing health crisis with so many immigrants being detained in one place. \nHope this sheds some light on the situation. ",

(They are forcing Austerity Measures across the board). \n\n3) Germany's Birth rate is 1.38 and you need a birth rate of 2.2 to maintain a countries population. They actually need to have immigrants or they will collapse as the country ages. \n\n4) Germany wants to avoid anything that even resembles the racist actions taken during the Nazis Era. This is a very big fear for the Government and many citizens in German. ",

It's a powerhouse and they need to be proud of what they've achieved. They should (as we all should) bring in their fair share of refugees but they need to lose the apologetic nature of their dialogues and move on up. They are muscle, they just forgot how to use it. ",

Something that wasn't very obvious before the fall of the Berlin wall because the political pressures of the time still maintained a pro american/capitalist ruling class and especially media. These needed the usual ideological justification.\nThis I think is something that is quite rapidly disintegrating. \n\nFrom the hard left's point of view, german culture is not accepted as being a proper or 'non-fascist culture' at all, thus it has nothing to fear from being put under pressure by constant dilution.

Those who apply for asylum and actually manage to get it granted will be allowed to stay. In the meantime all the refugees will be granted a 'duldung' visa, which is a temporary stay visa, 6 months unless something has changed.

                "Because I have studied Estonian history and I am Estonian myself, I can mainly give an answer about the situation in Estonia.\n\nAs far as their numbers go, Baltic-Germans were never very numerous. According to the Russian Empire Census  there were only 180,000 Baltic Germans in Russia's Baltic provinces (moderen day Estonia and Latvia (except Latgale region)). In comparison at that time (1897) population of those provinces was arround 2,4 million. That means that Germans weren't there in high-numbers.\n\nWhile Germans weren't very numerous, they had control over most cities. During that timeline (16th-19th century) most prominent cities in modern-day Estonia (Tallinn, Tartu, Pärnu, Viljandi, Narva) still followed Hanseatic laws. That meant that city officials were chosen up until early 19th century only amongst the German merchants. That meant that city was run by Germans and was mainly meant for Germans. That of course attracted Germans from countryside and from abroad. Until industrialisation took place in early 19th century most cities had German or sometimes Scandinavian high-end crafters (bakers, goldsmith, shoemakers etc) and merchants, while most Estonians worked as less valued crafters (f.e builders, butchers, gravediggers etc). Cities became more Estonian after industrialisation started to take off. During that time period local peasentry was freed from serfdom and thanks to industrialisation those peasents were able to become laborers in newly created factories. This pattern was common ammongst the towns that were given city rights before Russia conquered modern-day Estonia. Most of them were trading towns and that is why those towns had mainly Germans or otherwise non-Estonian population. During Russian rule Russia also created few administrative and later even few industrious towns. Most notably such towns were Võru and Paide (Võru gained and Paide regained it's city rights during rule of Catherine the Great). Because such towns didn't had historical precedent for German population, they ended up having mainly Estonian population even during 18th century.\n\nOutside of cities, most Germans were landowners/manorholders and because of that they ended up living far away from each other in their castles or manors. That is why outside of cities there weren't any significant Germanic majority areas. \n\nMost likely modern-day Latvia (except Latgale region) experienced similar situation as modern-day Estonia because both areas were under German jurisdiction and administration. This special status lasted until the beginning of the russification in the Baltic Provinces in 1876. \n\nI don't know much about Lithuanian history and because of that I can't give an answer about the situation in Lithuania. \n\nHopefully my answer was helpful :)\n"

                "Can't speak for normal radio, but if you're talking about XM-Sirius Radio, it's because they are data compressed. XM-Sirius uses digital signals to send the audio to your car. They only have a certain amount of signal bandwidth to use and this has to get split up between all their channels. In order to have a higher number of channels, they use a smaller bandwidth per channel. The amount of bandwidth they use is not enough to send the audio in its normal quality. They have to re-encode it a lower quality in order to make it fit in the bandwidth for each channel. ",
                "Its the equalization and compression they put the signal through. They get rid of some of the really low and really high pitches in the equalization because they're less important. Then they compress it, making the loud sounds quieter and the quiet sounds louder. These steps help to get the most sound out of a weak signal. The cymbols make sounds that are both high pitched and loud, so both the eq and compression remove part of the sound. The \"s\" sound you asked about may be a different effect, created by bad microphone placement. Essentially it's the sound of the person blowing air into the mic. When you're recording something with a sound engineer they'll listen for this, move the mic to fix this, and record again, but you don't have that opportunity live. The eq and compression probably make this even more noticeable "

                "By halves I am going to assume this is referring to the administrative split of the Roman Empire into East and West performed by the Emperor Theodosius I in 395 AD (at his death). \n\nWhile the two halves of the Empire after 395 AD increasingly went separate ways politically, they still largely thought of themselves as part of a greater whole. There was certainly rivalry between Emperors and generals from the two halves but nothing that came to full scale conflict. In fact, the Eastern Roman Empire (ERE) provided military assistance to the Western Roman Empire (WRE) as late as 467/468 AD during the disastrous invasion of Vandalic Carthage/Libya. The WRE would officially cease to exist in 476 AD. \n\nThe closest the WRE and ERE came to blows was during a rather complicated time period where Flavius Stilicho, the highest ranking general in the west, attempted to use the Visigoths and their king Alaric to threaten the ERE over territory in Illyricum. Stilicho didn't live long enough to follow through on this and his end goals/plans for Alaric and the Visigoths are not entirely clear. \n\n**Edit** thanks /u/Guckfuchs for correcting me, I had completely forgot about the succession crisis after Honorius' death. The Eastern Emperor Theodosius II did send an army to remove Johannes (John) from the Western Throne and installed Valentinian III, his cousin. It is an important and interesting point to note that Theodosius bothered naming a new Emperor in the West, rather than simply claiming sole control over the entire Roman Empire. \n\n*History of the Wars* Procopius\n\n*Historia Nova* Zosimus",
                "I’d like to add a small correction to u/mrleopards ‘ and u/WispyWalrus ‘ accounts. There was at least one instance of armed conflict between the two halves of the empire after 395 AD. In August 423 AD the western emperor Honorius died. Throughout his reign there had been several moments when both halves of the empire nearly came to blows even though the east had been ruled first by his brother Arcadius and then his nephew Theodosius II. Honorius himself had never much control over governance. Instead the west was ruled by powerful military figures like Stilicho and later Flavius Constantius. The later even rose to co-emperor in the west. Both men seem to have been close to starting a war with the east at times but both also died before anything could come about. And it had always been Honorius who had guaranteed the legitimacy of the western government as he was a member of the dynasty that had been ruling both parts of the Roman Empire for more than half a century. \n\nSo when he finally died in 423 AD that posed something of a problem for the western elites: they didn’t have any members of the Valentinian-Theodosian family left which could have ascended to the throne. After a few months of negotiations they agreed to elevate a senior civil servant, the *primicerius notariorum* Johannes, who became emperor in November of the same year. He had the support of powerful generals like the *cura palatii* Aetius. Others however were much colder towards him and so his control over the west was sketchy at best. The most important opposition towards Johannes came from the east. The court of emperor Theodosius II wasn’t thrilled to see the western throne pass to someone who wasn’t part of the dynasty. Johannes and his supporters certainly hoped to come to an agreement with Constantinople but when Theodosius elevated his cousin Valentinian III to the purple in October 424 AD it became clear that civil war was inevitable.\n\nValentinian who was just a five year old boy at the time was the son of Galla Placidia, the half-sister of Honorius and Arcadius. She had been an influential figure at the western court until court intrigues had forced her to relocate to Constantinople in 422. Now she and her son returned to the west at the head of an East Roman army commanded by the general Ardaburius. After some initial successes disaster struck in the form of a storm that hid the East Roman navy. Ardaburius himself was captured and taken prisoner at Ravenna. However his son Aspar who had been in command of the cavalry and was leading them into Italy by land could again change the fortunes of war. He was able to take Ravenna, free his father and deliver Johannes to Galla Placidia and Valentinian III at Aquileia. When Aetius arrived in Italy with a substantial contingent of Hunnic soldiers his emperor had already been executed and the civil war was effectively over. Aetius was able to come to an agreement with the new regime and would later rise to become the dominant military figure in the west. The hero of the war, Aspar, achieved a similar ascent in the east.\n\nThere are some famous late antique monuments that are connected to this rather short civil war. At Ravenna Galla Placidia founded the church of San Giovanni Evangelista. The mosaic decoration of its apse is unfortunately lost but according to an early medieval source it commemorated Placidia’s miraculous rescue from the storm that had hit the eastern army. It also featured several portraits of members of her family, the dynasty who’s rule over the west had been restored in 425. In the east it is possible that the Golden Gate, the huge marble main entry into Constantinople, was also constructed to commemorate victory in this civil war. It was originally topped by a bronze statue of Theodosius riding a chariot drawn by four elephants. Although the emperor had never left his capital throughout the events he was seemingly still able to propagate himself as the true victor of the war.\n\nFinally, to echo u/shlin28 here: It is important to remember that those events as well as similar wars that preceded them shouldn't be seen as conflicts between two distinct states but as civil wars over the leadership in one unified empire. Theodosius and his generals weren’t fighting an enemy state but a usurper who had deprived his family of its right to rule both halves of the empire."

The H proteins are rather shaped like a stalk of broccoli, with the stalk at the viral membrane and the bunchy part exposed where antibodies can recognize it.\n\nInsertional mutagenesis studies, where 15 nucleotides are inserted into various parts of the hemagluttinin “broccoli”, show that influenza virus is very tolerant on the extra corresponding 5 amino acids compared to measles, especially in the bunchy region that is most available to targeting antibodies.  Viral outgrowth assays show influenza is able to infect and proliferate just fine with inserted mutations (and evade the antibody immune response) while measles virus does not tolerate insertions; thus part of the reason why the measles vaccine has been so long-lasting, but the influenza vaccine is much shorter lived.",

                "You say “viruses like influenza”, but in fact it’s not viruses *like* influenza, it’s *only* influenza that does this. Influenza is unique in the virus world in its ability to evolve to avoid population immunity. Technically, influenza doesn’t mutate fast than other RNA viruses, but its surface proteins are more tolerant of mutations than other viruses are. See my answer in [Why of some viruses mutate faster than others](_URL_2_) for details and references. \n\nIf you think about the vast majority of viral vaccines (measles, mumps, rubella, Yellow Fever, polio, etc etc etc) they do *not* need to be updated annually. Even RNA viruses like measles and polio are antigenically very stable, in spite of having mutation rates that are very similar to influenza’s, and they haven’t needed to have their vaccines updated in the decades since they were introduced.\n\nThe question didn’t specifically ask about SARS-CoV-2, but since the other answers immediately turned to it ... Coronaviruses in general have slightly slower mutation rates than influenza, but they’re still very high. However, while they can and do readily accumulate mutations ([_URL_1_](_URL_0_) shows hundreds of mutations that the virus has made over the past few months) the default assumption - for good reasons - is that these mutations are neutral and don’t affect the virus function or antigenicity. \n\nIf we look at the four endemic human coronaviruses, they show some signs of slow antigenic change, which hints that coronaviruses *might* be able to tolerate *some* changes in their proteins, but clearly not to anywhere near the extent of influenza.  If we have to guess (and without data it’s mainly a guess) it seems likely that a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 will be effective for many years, perhaps 5-10 years, before the virus drifts enough that it might need an update. Maybe not quite as good as measles, but hopefully much better than influenza.",
                "Two things about influenza. First it is an RNA virus (compared to DNA viruses). RNA viruses are more error prone when they replicate so they generate mutations faster. \n\nSecond, unlike most viruses, it’s genome is segmented, that is its genome isn’t a single strand, but it’s genes come on different strands. If it coinfects a host with another flu strain they can exchange genes easily, creating another source of variability/mutation. \n\nIn this way human flu can gain characteristics of avian flu, for example, crating a virus humans haven’t gained any immunity to yet.",
                "The reason is because influenza has what is known as an \"error prone polymerase\".  Influenza's genome is made of RNA, not DNA, and it comes with instructions for copying it's own genome.  That comes in the form of RNA that makes a protein called \"RNA Polymerase\".  The RNA polymerase in influenza makes way more mistakes at copying RNA than our polymerase does, which leads to lots of mutations.  \n\nYou might think that in order to do that, it would be best if influenza didn't make a lot of mistakes in copying it's genome.  A lot of mistakes means that there are a lot of mutant virus particles produced that are total duds and can't generate a new infection.  But some of the copies of the virus have a mutated version in a surface protein.  \"H1\", in fact, is the name of one of the surface proteins. If that mutation causes the surface protein to have a slightly different shape, it might be enough to help that virus escape our immune system.\n\n & #x200B;\n\nIt seems that SARS-CoV2 does NOT have an error prone polymerase.",
                "Reassortment. Some viruses have multiple genomic parts, especially RNA viruses. Influenza segments dont evolve and mutate more rapidly, but since there are eight genomic segment strands, these can recombine in new ways. So you can get an avian HA with a pig NA with a human PA, or  < evil chord >  the Triple Reassortant. Now you have bits of virus present from three different source species, and if they work, maybe they brought in a completely new antigen to the human species experience. The ones on the outside of the virus change at a different rate than the ones in the inside, since they face host pressure differently.\n\nPolyproteins. Now lets say all your virus proteins are in one genomic strand, and all the coding regions are jammed together, in a polyprotein, like for Hepatitis C. Instead of like flu, you have all your eggs in one basket, and cant change one protein without impact the whole strain. Then the whole thing is locked together. Flavivirus doesnt evolve rapidaly at all. Almost all the outbreak strains from the last west african pandemic are 99% conserved and alike one another.\n\nSo when you talk of evolution, you can talk about mutation rate, or site subsitution rate more accurately. Or just about one protein or one site. Some substitutions are silent. And, the end result is always important- whether the Strain is itself different. Different parts change at different rates. I think what you are asking is about the strain change rate. \n\nA lot of change rates contribute to that.",
                "DNA viruses are more stable than RNA viruses and thus don't mutate as frequently. Especially if the DNA virus is dsDNA (double stranded). This will allow for repairing of one strand and thus reduce mutations. This is the case for HIV. If you have an ssRNA (single stranded) virus, then it is MUCH more likely to mutate as they aren't as stable as DNA and dont really have a good repair mechanism.\n\n3 outcomes of mutations: \n\n1. Virus become less virulent (good)\n2. Nothing happens\n3. Virus becomes more virulent (bad)"

And when the deployment is over you have to move everyone and everything back and deal with sorting it all out.\n\nMy simple math on moving and housing 5000 people is as follows.  5000 people need food, transport, and housing for 42 days.  Figure it takes $300 a day per person.  Simple math:  5000 people x $300 a day x 42 days = 63,000,000.

But on a much larger scale.\n\nThe only real difference is that you don't send him with a regular flight. You send him in your own airplane, among a few hundred others. That airplane goes back and forth for a few days.\n\nAnd when he gets there, you have already sent a few vehicles there in advance. With mechanics, because with that amount of vehicles, shit will break down in a pretty constant flow.\n\nAnd you don't bother with hotels. Because you have your own mobile living quarters that some people have been spending a week or two setting up in neat rows before you arrive.

You literally bring people who's sole job it is to drive off with trucks every day to fetch fuel and food.\n\nIn other words, if they send 5000 soldiers, they'll send at least a few hundred others who's job it is to make it easier for the actual fire-arm-holding soldiers to do their job. And that cost stacks up too. (in reality, though, if they send 5000 men and women to the border, around 4600 of them are actually doing what they are there to do. The others do things that has to be done for that main goal to continue to happen for more than a day or two. No-one is keen enough on doing the governments bidding to do it on an empty stomach.

Rather they were revisions to the pre-existing Meiji constitution, which had been intentionally based upon a synthesis of the British parliamentary model along with Prussian militarism. \n\nThe Potsdam Declaration, which defined the terms of the Japanese surrender at the end of the Second World War, called for the dismantling of Japanese militarism and re-establishment of democratic freedoms. It did not require a totally new constitution. \n\nEven if the U.S. had desired a completely new constiturion, it likely would have looked to the British model for its constitutional monarchy. A major concession the U.S. had allowed Japan in their surrender terms was preservation of the emperor. But they didn't want the emperor to be allowed to overrule the will of the Japanese people in a future government. So the U.S. allowed the emperor to continue his rule in a largely ceremonial capacity. This allowed the Japanese to preserve kokutai - the concept that Japan's emperors united them to their ancient past in an unbroken line of succession - without compromising the allies' demand for a truly democratic government. \n\nHere is a great source for many key documents and commentaries about the establishment of Japan's constitution: [Birth of the Constitution of Japan](_URL_0_)",

Salt in the soil is best washed away by fresh water, but because this clay / silt layer is relatively impermeable, the filtration process, called *leaching*, is slow. The duration of salt contamination will depend on the level of drainage and precipitation rates for that particular area so difficult to generalise.",

For instance, after the 1953 north sea flood.\n\nFor the Dutch soil, all salt from flooding is washed away within 1-4 years. This depends on sveral factors, such as duration of flood, dept of the groundwater level, amount of moisture in de ground above groundwater level, precipitation etc\n\nFor some recovery nature needs some help. The (NaCl) salt water also worsens the mineral structure of older clay. Even if the salt itself is already washed away. Naturally the clay could take up to 8 years to recover. Fertilizing with gypsum is enough to repair this and this pays for itself in the first year.\n\nA sweet water flood costs 1 year of production, a salt water flood generally 2-3 years.With gypsum that 3 years can be reduced to 2 years of loss.  The second year some salt-resistant crops can be grown, so the economic damage could be a bit less. In fact, for weaker fields the silt from the inundation increases fertility in the long term.",

Because the sheer mass of salt needed to contaminate a single field sounds unrealistic to acquire, transport, and acquire.

Probably from saltwater flooding I guess, seeing how it kills agriculture for a few years.  Still, I'm not sure how many had experience with that, as tsunamis are rare and the bulk of agriculture is closer to freshwater flooding probs than salt water.",

Things are gradually getting more expensive and more difficult to grow. But by far the biggest problem is humans nature rather than adapting or admitting defeat we are constantly looking for quick fixes. An example, a farmer is using a desalination device to remove salt water from the well water. The desal water goes on the plants and the runoff from the device (as it is inland) back onto the soil (away from crops). The desal is often mixed with well water to make it less salty and to reduce the cost. There is an awful lot of good intentions but you feel for some of the growers"

                "There's a shadowy story that's emerged from North Korea concerning Kim Jong-il that's given historians some pause. Unfortunately, we're probably decades past the point when we could confirm it with total confidence, and that's *if* we could have confirmed it at all. Not only does it belong to a period that the North Korean government has heavily mythologized, but most (if not all) of the people who would be in a position to confirm it have since died. There are probably still members of the Kim family around who know for sure, but they're not very talkative people.\n\nAnyway, it's a pretty good guide en miniature to the difficulties of assembling North Korean history.\n\n**Yura and Shura:** What most North Koreans aren't told is that Kim Jong-il (the eldest son of, and later successor to, Kim il-Sung) wasn't born in North Korea at all. After about 5 years of harassing the Japanese in Manchuria as part of a Chinese-led force, his father had to bail out of the fight when things got hot, and he fled for the Soviet Union with his then-wife, Kim Jong-suk. Contrary to the official history distributed by the North Korean state, Kim il-Sung never fought in Korea, and in fact sat out World War II. Kim Jong-il was likely born in a Soviet army camp in Siberia in 1942, and he was followed by a little brother in 1944. This little brother's existence is also unknown to most North Koreans, for reasons that will become apparent shortly.\n\nThe two boys were nicknamed Yura and Shura respectively (Russian nicknames for Yuri and Alexander -- and in fact, we only know the younger brother's nickname), and they accompanied their parents back to Korea after World War II ended and the Soviet army descended into the peninsula. The story that concerns us today comes from 1948, when Jong-il would have been 5-6 years old and his brother 3-4. They were said to have been playing in a pond in Pyongyang, and as his younger brother repeatedly tried to climb out of the pond, Jong-il pushed him back in. Shura eventually tottered under the water after another push, was too exhausted to pull himself out, and drowned. Their parents were too late upon the scene to rescue him, shouted at Jong-il for an explanation, and didn't receive one.\n\nSo. If the story is true, then Kim Jong-il killed his younger brother at a very young age. Was it something that should have been a warning sign, as you ask here, or was it simply a family tragedy caused by a child too young to realize what he was doing? I'm not sure I can answer that.\n\nAnd how do we know about this in the first place? The story comes to us via a North Korean official who defected to South Korea in 1960.\n\n**Why it might not be true:** Trying to assemble an accurate narrative about events within North Korea is difficult even under the best of circumstances, because NK's government has a very opportunistic approach to its own history. Events that support the narrative of Kim il-Sung, and secondarily Kim Jong-il, as the great saviors of their nation, are exalted and embellished, if they aren't being made up entirely. Events that do not support this narrative are downplayed at best and erased at worst. That's bad on its own, but the acrimonious relationship between North and South Korea added another layer of complexity. With anything that was filtered through the South Korean government, it was prudent to ask whether they were putting their own spin on the information, or simply not publicizing anything that might have countered it.\n\nThe defector who provided the story arrived in SK about 7 years after the Korean War, in a period when passions and propaganda were running high on both sides of the border. Maybe the guy was telling the truth about a story that was whispered around the upper tier of NK's government. Maybe he was telling a version of the truth and played it up for the benefit of the South Korean intelligence service, which would certainly have loved hearing anything bad about North Korea. Maybe he made a vague reference to a story like it, and SK intelligence filled in the details, as it were. Or maybe he said nothing of the sort and the South Korean government simply made it up. We don't really know.\n\n**Why it might actually be true:** However, historians tend to entertain the defector's story as a serious possibility, even if they don't necessarily believe it means Kim Jong-il was a childhood sociopath. \"Shura\" is curiously absent from all official North Korean histories, but thanks to Soviet army records, we know that he did in fact exist, and that his age in 1948 would have made the defector's story plausible. \n\nKim Jong-il was active in North Korea's government from his early 20s onwards, and he started his career by controlling the country's art and literature scene (he was primarily interested in, and most famous for, the country's movie scene, but it wasn't the only thing he did). Even from an early age, he had absolute control over his personal narrative within North Korea, and he was big on playing up anything that could win him additional sympathy or support from the North Korean populace (e.g., his mother's early death in 1949 -- yes, a year after Shura). Why? Because his position as his father's successor was not (we think) guaranteed until much later. He had an advantage as his father's eldest son, but his step-siblings were born a bit more than a decade after he was, in a time when Kim il-Sung was firmly established as North Korea's absolute ruler and could afford to spend more time with them. Kim Pyong-il, Kim il-Sung's son by the favored wife, Kim Song-ae, was said to be a particular favorite and the most likely rival for the top job. Pyong-il was actually shunted into ambassadorships later in his life, but while Kim Jong-il was working his way up the government ladder and currying favor with Dad, he only saw Pyong-il as a threat against his interests and worked hard to eliminate or minimize it. Arguably the most effective way he did this was by controlling the information given to the public on the Kim family.\n\nSo of the histories that Jong-il approved and published, none of them make any reference to Shura -- it's as if he never existed at all -- and none of them acknowledge that Kim Jong-il had step-siblings. North Koreans are instead presented with a very sanitized story in which Kim il-Sung's only son was:\n\n - born on the sacred Mount Paektu in 1942 (which he wasn't)\n - fired at retreating Japanese at the age of 3 (doubtful), and:\n - tragically lost his mother at the age of 7 (one out of three ain't bad). \n\nIf Shura had died in a genuine accident or in something completely unrelated to Jong-il, it seems reasonable to assume that Jong-il would have played up the tragic circumstances of his brother's death in much the same way that he played up their mother's early death. Instead, silence.\n\nSorry to write so much; I just think it's one of the more interesting (if creepy) quirks in North Korea's history.\n\n**EDIT:** I should probably give an additional detail that makes me think that the defector's story might be true. Dynastic succession wasn't a \"thing\" in Communist governments (Marx had inveighed against the whole notion of inherited power), and people who worked in NK's government in the early 1960s would not necessarily have believed that Kim il-Sung's job would only be passed to a son. Kim Jong-il wasn't yet part of NK's government when the official defected, and even after he became part of the government, he wasn't universally liked. So the official may not have attached the kind of weighty importance to the story that we're inclined to do today, because Jong-il was just a pain-in-the-ass college kid at the time and not necessarily a figure of great destiny in North Korean culture.",
                "If I might, I'd like to take a moment to disagree with the premise of your question, especially the \"Why was this not caught at a young age?\" part. If you take a dictator and start looking at his life history for violent events, you may very well find some. But even *if* (I stress the \"if\"; I haven't done an exhaustive survey) all dictators had violent events in their youth, that doesn't mean that everyone with a violent event in their youth becomes a dictator, which is what your \"why was this not caught\" seems to imply. Many adults will have had violent episodes in their youth, and most of them didn't grow up to become dictators. \n\nThe question about \"things dictators did as kids/teens\" is very interesting, but for the reason outlined above I'd be very careful about using terms such as \"alerted\" and \"caught at a young age\".\n\n*edit: spelling*",

There are two ways they are designed. One is rigid, the other is soft.\n\nThe rigid design is built like the kind of suit that divers use, where the parts are hard and the joints have special hardware that allow them to rotate or bend as needed.\n\nThe soft ones rely on the fabric of the suit hinging the way it needs to by folding. The suits are not actually soft like your clothing is, and they don't stretch like rubber. It's a thick, stiff fabric.",

Those would be a lot smaller and more flexible but have their own issues."

        "selftext": "Taken from wikipedia:\n\n*Some older versions of this rhyme had the word nigger instead of tiger:*\n\n*Eeny, meena, mina, mo,\nCatch a nigger by the toe;\nIf he hollers let him go,\nEena, meena, mina, mo.[3]\nThis version was similar to that reported as the most common version among American schoolchildren in 1888.[10] It was used in the chorus of Bert Fitzgibbon's 1906 song \"Eeny, Meeny, Miny, Mo\":*\n\n*Eeny, Meeny, Miny, Mo,\nCatch a nigger by his toe,\nIf he won't work then let him go;\nSkidum, skidee, skidoo.\nBut when you get money, your little bride\nWill surely find out where you hide,\nSo there's the door and when I count four,\nThen out goes you.[11]*\n\n*It was also used by Rudyard Kipling in his \"A Counting-Out Song\", from Land and Sea Tales for Scouts and Guides, published in 1935.[12] This may have helped popularise this version in the United Kingdom where it seems to have replaced all earlier versions until the late twentieth century.[3]*\n\n*Iona and Peter Opie pointed out in The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes that the word \"nigger\" was common in American folk-lore, but unknown in any English traditional rhyme or proverb.[3] This, combined with evidence of various other versions of the rhyme in the British Isles pre-dating this version, would seem to suggest that it originated in North America, although the apparently American word 'holler' was first recorded in written form in England in the fourteenth century, whereas according to the Oxford English Dictionary the words 'Niger' or 'nigger' were first recorded in England in the sixteenth century with their current disparaging meaning. The 'olla' and 'toe' are found as nonsense words in some nineteenth century versions of the rhyme, and it could possibly be that the original 'Where do all the Frenchmen Go?' (probably originating during one of the periods of Anglo-French warfare) was later on replaced by the earlier version in the United States, using some of the nonsense words*\n\nSource: _URL_0_\n\nI have several questions:\n\n* Are words like \"Eeny\" \"Miny\" \"Skidum\" and \"Skidoo\" complete nonsense for the sake of creating a memorable delivery? What is the purpose of their usage?\n\n* How did the eeny, meeny, miny, moe rhyme begin? Was it a quick rhyme to tell small children, not unlike old pirate songs (ex; sing a song of sixpence, etc.)?\n\n* When the rhyme states \"If he won't work then let him go\" ... \" is this implying a slave should be murdered, if deemed unproductive? Released to hunt the slave? Is there historical significance here?\n\n* When the rhyme states \"But when you get money, your little bride will surely find out where you hide,\" What is this in reference to?\n\n* Why would anyone ever catch another human being by the toe? Or is this also to create a silly rhyme?\n\n* In addition to the now better known substitution of 'tiger' for 'nigger' I can tell you as a small child I definitely heard both iterations which is fascinating to me because I'm only in my 20's - so I'm curious about how the split began. I'd also be curious to hear how common each iteration is and what the origin is?\n\n",

                "I'd just like to say that nonsense syllables at the beginning of counting-out games isn't restricted to English, but actually fairly common in German and Norwegian. [The most popular German ditty begins](_URL_3_) \"Ene mene miste, es rappelt in der Kiste\" -- the first three words are nonsense, but set a rhythm and conveniently rhyme with the next line ('there's commotion in the chest/box'). [The same with the most popular Norwegian one,](_URL_0_) which begins \"Elle melle, deg fortelle\" ('elle melle, telling you') and ends \"snipp, snapp, snute, du er ute\" ('snip-snap snout, you are out') -- which, incidentally, is how you end fairy tales in Norwegian, only with 'the fairy tale' substituted for 'you'. \n\nThere's even some ditties in both German and Norwegian that are almost exclusively nonsense, interspersed with a couple of 'real' lines. [One of the German ones](_URL_2_) begins with what is widely assumed to be a bastarization of the French numbers one through four (\"ong dong dee kader\" for \"un, deux, trois, quatre\"), which makes sense considering it's from a town near the French border. A Norwegian example is [the second one on the wiki page for Norwegian counting-out games](_URL_1_).",
                "This is covered by David Rubin in his 1995 book *Memory in Oral Traditions: the Cognitive Psychology of Epic, Ballads, and Counting-out Rhymes*, chapter 10 (pp. 227-56). \n\nIn the nonsense syllables \"eenie meenie miney mo\", the sound patterns are key to their emergence and longevity (and this also applies to the other examples people have cited here): rhyme, alliteration, and assonance are all strongly self-replicating, self-propagating elements in oral traditions. Note that a single vowel gets repeated five times in the phrase \"eenie meenie miney mo\", and the syllable \"nee\" appears three times. These poetic devices also extend into the middle two lines, which convey a sort of meaning, though there meaning is also an important self-replication device so there's more room for incidental variations: when the first and last lines change, the changes tend to be more systematic, e.g. \"eena deena dina do\".\n\nTextual variations are abundant. Rubin reports 82 variants of the text in a catalog compiled in 1980, with 291 word-changes. He classifies the 291 word-changes as follows:\n\n* replacing most or all of the first and last lines: 41%\n* changes to the word \"tiger\": 25%\n* replacing most or all of the second and third lines: 13%\n* miscellaneous changes: 12%\n* changes to the word \"hollers\": 9%\n\nA higher percentage doesn't indicate more popular variations, but wider variation. For the word \"tiger\" (the second most variable element in the rhyme), he reports the following variants:\n\n* \"n****r\": 56 instances\n* \"tiger\": 9 instances\n* \"neighbor\": 3 instances\n* \"monkey\": 2 instances\n* \"baby\", \"beatnik\", \"feller\", \"lamb\", \"lion\", \"lizard\", \"pig\", \"robber\", \"rooster\", \"schmoo\", blank space: 1 instance each\n\nAgain, number of instances doesn't indicate popularity, but number of variants known. It's pretty obvious that \"n****r\" is a more primary version of the text, with the other variants as replacements to make the text more socially acceptable. Rubin points out that \"tiger\" and \"monkey\" are especially good replacements because they alliterate with \"toe\" and \"mo\" respectively.\n\nSome variants are regional: for example, the word \"hollers\" is routinely replaced by \"squeals\" in Great Britain (he may mean excluding N. Ireland, it's not clear) and New Zealand. Rubin reports a 1979-1980 survey of Duke undergraduates in which the number of variants known came out as follows:\n\n* replacing most or all of the first and last lines: 0%\n* changes to the word \"tiger\": 31%\n* replacing most or all of the second and third lines: 28%\n* miscellaneous changes: 38%\n* changes to the word \"hollers\": 3%\n\nSo in that population the variant \"eenie meenie miney mo\" is practically obligatory, and \"hollers\" is very much the standard. In terms of the relative popularity of alternatives to \"tiger\", here were the number of undergraduates who reported each variant:\n\n* \"tiger\": 73\n* \"monkey\", \"rabbit\": 10 each\n* \"n****r\": 4\n* blank space: 3\n* \"fellow\", \"piggie\": 2 each\n* \"blackbird\", \"bunny\", \"buyer\", \"chicken\", \"doggie\", \"froggie\", \"wiffer waffer\": 1 each\n\nAt pages 246-7 Rubin gets on to the history of the changes. Here's the incidence of \"n****r\" over time:\n\n* up to 1939: 84%\n* 1940s and 1950s: 62%\n* 1960s and 1970s: 37%\n\nSo \"n****r\" starts to get replaced around WWII, and the rate of replacement increased dramatically during the Civil Rights movement. This result is not very surprising, but it's nice to know for sure. At every stage in the history of the rhyme, Rubin notes, \n\n >  Using a both a comparison across all versions published in the folklore literature and a detailed analysis of two samples of *Eenie Meenie* collected 90 years apart, there were no trend that violated the constraints of the two rhymes\n\nin terms of their self-propagating phonetic characteristics. That is to say, however much the rhyme changes, the importance of rhyme, alliteration, and assonance remain constant. (For reference, the second rhyme Rubin refers to is \"One potato, two potato\".) So, he concludes,\n\n >  By either estimate [of the number of generations of children], *Eenie Meenie* has been stable for almost 20 generations. Thus the multiple constrains shown to operate in recall appear to function over historical time.\n\nRubin doesn't discuss the origins of the rhyme, but I don't imagine he'd have much to add to the report in Wikipedia. In terms of the motivation for why such a rhyme exists: counting-out rhymes are, if not universal, at least a very widespread habit among children. \"Eenie meenie\" fits into a category of many such rhymes: just in English, some other examples are \"One potato, two potato\"; \"Onery, twoery, tickery, teven\"; \"Acker, backer, soda cracker\"; and as other posters have pointed out, there's no shortage of counting-out rhymes in other languages."

                "Considered by whom?\n\nThe Byzantines considered their empire to be *the* Roman Empire, since there was unbroken rule from the Roman Empire to theirs. The relocation of the capital to Constantinople started a process that shifted the 'gravitational' centre of the Empire to the East long before the fall of the Western Empire in the 5th century, but for all its Greek-ness, the Eastern Empire considered itself 'the Empire', and 'Roman'. There wasn't an internal sense that they weren't the direct descendant of Rome at all.\n\nIn the West, another story is at play. You have the formal end of the Western Empire in 476 when Romulus Augustus is forced to abidicate, but the Western Empire ceased to function as considerably earlier. The title of Emperor was revived briefly under Charlemagne, but barely outlived his death. You then have Otto I crowned Emperor of the Romans in 962. *Europeans* saw this as a revival of the Roman state, based on the transfer of power, legitimisation by the Pope, and a cultural overlay of Romanity with Western Catholicism centered on Rome. Of course, the Byzantines had been holding the office of Emperor of the Romans all this time, so we none too pleased.\n\n",
                "Just as a FYI, whenever I see the word \"really\" in a question, it tends to red flag to me that it's going to get complicated and contentious, as the word is basically a challenge for iconoclasts and iconophiles to gather and deathmatch for the amusement (and sometimes education) of the OP.\n\nIn a nutshell, the answer to a question of \"was it really?\" will always be \"depends\".  This case is no different.\n\nMuch hinges upon definitions, of which nobody is in firm agreement on.  What constitutes a Roman?  What constitutes an empire?  What constitutes continuance?  What constitutes a split?  \n\nYour choice of how to answer these questions of definition, will ultimately reframe the question to a particular answer, as well as lead to even more questions.  \n\nNot to mention, that history is always being used to legitimize the present, thus the answer to your question, is also political.  Some people/ideologies/cultures/states have vested interests in claiming  continuity or discontinuity of the empire.\n\nThis being no different on Reddit, of which some have a particularly defensive attitude towards the Byzantines, that some of us AHers here have theorized comes from a certain affinity for particular factions in computer wargames (thank you Total War and Paradox Interactive).\n\nPut another way, the academics don't even agree on the answer to this question.  I seriously doubt we'll be able to resolve it on Reddit either.\n\nBut lets just say, in the interests of giving you an answer (albeit an unsatisfactory one), that:\n\nA case can be made for either of those positions.  But there is no consensus.  Nor will there probably ever be one, because of the useful political hot potato the Roman Empire is and likely will be in the forseeable future to people interested in making the Roman Empire a precedent for their views."

Even as the nuclei are ejected, you'd have this positive nucleus and a negative cloud of electrons, and that's pretty attractive. Plus most fission processes happen within a solid material, so there's really not a whole lot of room for the nuclei to move before they're stopped, so the electrons catch up pretty quickly. I don't know the exact timeframes here, but I wouldn't call it at any point a \"plasma\" (excepting the case of a fission bomb, where the reaction gets hot enough to strip electrons from their nuclei)",

The kinetic energy of these fission fragments is around 180 MeV, about an MeV/nucleon in rough numbers, accounting for most of the energy released in the fission process. While the fragments are moving quite fast (of order 10^9 cm/s), they aren't *so* fast that some of the electrons can't latch on before separation. Consequently, the fission fragments ejected aren't bare nuclei, typically, but rather nuclei with ionization states in the 20s or so (depending on conditions).\n\nThis assumes the parent nuclei begin with most of their electrons (e.g., the fissile material is a solid or weakly ionized plasma). If the nuclei are in a highly ionized plasma, however, such as in the later stages of a supercritical assembly, then the parent nuclei may have only a few bound electrons, the fission fragments will acquire fewer (or no) electrons as they go, and your original picture is more appropriate. \n\nAs for your last question, not only the ionization state of the fragments as they slow down in the surrounding matter, but also how far they go and how long it takes them to stop depend on the properties of the matter through which they travel.\n\nEdit: fixed a grammar mistake in the last sentence.

                "I don't know the source, but this topic came up at informal gathering of psychology researchers that I recently attended. Apparently, most thoughts are actually non-verbal. In a study, researchers would ask people at random intervals to say what they were thinking at that exact moment. It usually wasn't verbal. It was things like what to make for dinner, the temperature, how they were going to perform some task, etc. In fact, they frequently had a hard time verbalizing what they were thinking.\n\n*second hand info, so take with a grain of salt*",

He developed the Descriptive Experience Sampling method, which tackles what people experience at the \"footlight of consciousness\". I think there are 5 main categories of how people 'experience'. I don't remember everything, but the link should take you to all of the resources.",
                "I've asked myself that question for a while.\n\nIn the end, it seems like I couldn't not think without using some form of language or words. (In this case english) Most of the things that I think about require me to say it or go through it in my head with an inner monologue. For example, I am saying everything I type in my head, and thinking what I am going to say next.\n\n\nOther times when I'm figuring out how to solve a problem, either a mathematical problem or a puzzle, I would talk myself through the process of how to do it.\n\n\nBut, there are instances where I do not use an inner monologue. When I am playing FPS's, the number one rule I follow is to not \"think\". I don't talk to myself when running around shooting people. I rely on instinct, thinking without thinking about thinking. The reason is, when I start to talk to myself, I become misled and play much poorer than if I were to just play.\n\n\nSo in my case, for many tasks, I use an inner monologue to \"guide\" me through problems, but during situations where I don't have time to either form an inner monologue or think, I simply think- on the fly.\n\nI hope this answers your question!\n\nEdit: I used an inner monologue to form this answer",

That experience is not all that 'advanced' or 'deep' or whatever, but it is definitely the one that threw the most light on my self-understanding. I am not that voice in my head, and I can feel that now.\n\nIt's a bit vague but perhaps he is suggesting it's possible to train the brain to think in other ways than inner monologue, which may be preferable for some people. Can't comment on it myself as I haven't experienced this phenomenon.",

                "I can do both. I'm getting to where I can almost count without thinking numbers.  I work in a bank and the most time-consuming part of counting bills is the time it takes to \"say\" each number in my head.  I know my brain can keep track without putting the words to it, because the concept of 5 is separate from the word \"five,\" but where I get hung up is trusting myself to know that I've done it right. \n\nI'm working on it though.\n\nOn a side note, why did we make the names for numbers so long? Why should the word for 17 have three syllables when it's not a very high number?",
                "I usually don't have an inner monologue. One exception is sometimes when I'm studying. You know how they say the best way to learn something is to teach it to someone else? I pretend to teach the material to some imaginary person in my head using an inner monologue.\n\nI actually prefer teaching an imaginary person in my head over a real person because often my first attempt to explain something is hopelessly verbose and convoluted. In my head I can keep answering the same question over and over until I have a concise, intuitive answer. That's when I know I really understand something. I find this method of studying extremely effective, and it has served me well over the years.\n\nTo answer your original question, I think it's more efficient to think without an inner monologue, but using an inner monologue while studying really forces me to focus on details I might gloss over if I'm just thinking normally.",
                "I can't talk about the why or what, but I can talk a bit about advantage.\n\nEducation research shows that metacognition (thinking about f yyour thinking) improves learning. I'm going to make a big assumption and assume that thinking in an inner monologue means you are more likely to be metacognating than if you aren't thinking in speech. If this assumption is correct, having an inner monologue may improve learning.",
                "You just reminded me that I can actually remember a point in my childhood when I noticed that I had started to think in words, and tried to decide which way of thinking was best.  I found it a little restrictive and strange.\n\nAdditionally I suspect that in the minds of 'thinking in words' people, language will ultimately affect the thought process.  Orwell touches on this in '1984' with reference to newer editions of the official Newspeak Dictionary having less words than the previous one, and removal of negative words, being replaced by simply prefixing positive ones - 'ungood' rather than 'bad' for example.  I also suspect this is what makes German speaking people predisposed to excel in areas where ambiguity is not beneficial (engineering for example) as the language seems to lean towards there being few ways to express some concepts.",
                "There's a lot of evidence that complex thought is impossible without language.  For example, until a child learns the word \"before\" they probably don't have any way at all to conceptualize of one event preceding another.\n\nIt seems that all thought, then either engages either the language centers of the brain, or alternately reflexively uses familiar connections in the brain that were originally indexed by the language center of the brain.  By that I mean- you don't think the word \"chair\" every time you see a chair- but you always recognize it- and the concept of a \"chair\" is almost certainly primarily indexed by the language centers.\n\nSo, really, the difference between an internal monologue and more automatic thought would be the degree to which you are activating the language centers of your brain, or merely activating those clusters of neurons that are immediately peripheral to words that are making up the core of the thought.\n\nTo a certain extent you can actually do an exercise in which you can see how the same thought can be accessed in two different ways while remaining substantively identical:\n\nRead this phrase to yourself:\n\n\"I really eating potato chips.  They're very tasty.\"\n\nNow, read the sentence again, but this time as you read it, imagine that it is the voice of your father or mother or a celebrity speaking it.\n\nSo what was the difference?\n\nThe first time you read the sentence, the language centers of your brain lit up. On a brain scan that would be an area somewhere in the left hemisphere of your brain, fairly medial- maybe an inch or two in, back and behind and above your left ear.\n\nThe second time you read it- imagining someone else's voice- those same areas lit up, but additionally, parts of your auditory centers lit up as well- almost exactly as they would if you actually HEARD someone speaking.

                "**(1/2)**\n\nThe idea that to obtain true freedom African-Americans needed their own land was expressed several times throughout the war. But this radical effort to give them lands aroused the opposition of conservatives and brought to light the great ambiguities within the Republican ideology. \n\nReconstruction, for all intents and purposes, begins in 1863, when the Union finally came to control large sections of Louisiana and Tennessee. The Lincoln administration then entered an oftentimes bitter rivalry with Congress over who should control the Reconstruction process. As a moderate, Lincoln wanted to bring the rebellious states back into the Union as soon as possible, but Radical Republicans believed that Reconstruction would be worthless unless massive social and economic changes accompanied it. They sought to break the power of the White elites and help Black Americans to be truly independent. Wendell Phillips, for instance, said that \"The war can be ended only by annihilating that Oligarchy which formed and rules the South and makes the war—by annihilating a state of society.\" But the idea of making special efforts on behalf of the freedmen clashed hard with the prevailing idea of Free Labor. \n\nAs an ideology, Free Labor was the guiding principle of the Republican Party and their vision of what the North, and ultimately the United States, should be. But the ideology held that people should be given the *chance* to prove themselves, with everyone being given equal opportunity in what Lincoln called \"the race of life.\" Thus, it's evident that the ideology ignored the existence of systematic inequalities that would require a greater social and economic intervention on the part of the Federal Government. Some recognized that it was \"nonsense to talk about the inferiority of the negro race, whilst at the same time they are kept in a state of degradation\", but as a whole many Republicans believed that the lack of success of African-Americans was a result of their own moral defects, accusing them of being \"indolent, improvident, servile, and licentious.\" As a result, the idea of giving them free land struck many Republicans not as a step for equality, but as unjust aid that they, perhaps, would not be able to use. \n\nThe Black community itself declared that they needed just legal and political equality to achieve economic and social equality by themselves. None other than Frederick Douglass said that when it came to the Negro and his future position the government should “do nothing…. Give him a chance to stand on his own legs! Let him alone!” He further argued that special privileges would only breed bitterness and resentment, and do nothing to prepare African-Americans for freedom after the government inevitably stopped its involvement, saying that broad intervention would only “serve to keep up the very prejudices, which it is so desirable to banish.\" Insisting that \"dependence is degradation,\" Black leaders sought only equal opportunity: \"Remove all obstacles, and give the black man an equal chance, . . . and then should he not succeed, he will not ask you or anyone else to mourn over his failure.\" \n\nNonetheless, as long as political and social power remained in the hands of the same social elites, and systematic inequalities that hindered the economic advancement of Black communities remained, Blacks did not really have an equal chance. The new Southern governments that were created with the blessing and permission of the Johnson Administration showed this through their creation of \"Black codes\", laws that restricted the newfound freedom and rights of African-Americans. For example, they declared all Blacks not in employment to be \"vagrants\", and then assigned \"hard work\" as the punishment for convicted \"criminals.\" Years before this, prescient Radicals, such as the Hoosier Congressman George Julian, led the fight for the creation of a Freedmen's Bureau that could protect them and their rights, because otherwise the ex-slaves would fall into a system “a system of wage slavery … more galling than slavery itself.” \n\nThe Radicals supported a Confiscation Act that could take rebel land and distribute it among former slaves. But although the House and Senate both passed individual bills to that effect, no unified measure was reached. Legislation for the creation of the Freedmen's Bureau was also delayed due to confusion and fights over whether the Bureau should be under the War or Treasury Departments. Since the Treasury was headed by the Radicals' friend Salmon P. Chase, they wanted him to oversight the whole venture. After Chase was appointed to the Supreme Court and thanks also to Sherman's Special Field Orders N°15, the Bureau was finally created in 1865. In accordance with the Republican aversion of permanent guardianship of the Freedmen, the Bureau was supposed to exist for only one year, and it was given no budget. Some Radicals, like Charles Sumner, wanted it to be a permanent agency, equal to and independent of the other Departments, but this was to no avail. \n\nThe fact that Sherman took a part in this Radical measure is kind of ironic, for he was a rather conservative man who is described as \"neither a humanitarian reformer nor a man with any particular concern for blacks.\" Sherman himself would later said that he only issued the order as a temporal war-time measure at the behest of Secretary of War Stanton. As Sherman's army marched through Georgia, some 20,000 slaves abandoned their plantations and joined this \"fulfillment of the millennial prophecies.” When he reached Lincoln's Christmas Gift of Savannah, he was joined by Stanton, and they met with the Black leaders of the city. They made it clear that “to have land, and turn it and till it by our own labor,” would be the best form of preserving their liberty, and also that they \"would prefer to live by ourselves, for there is a prejudice against us in the South that will take years to get over.” Four days later, Sherman issued his orders, which \"designated the sea islands and the rich plantation areas bordering rivers for thirty miles inland from Charleston down to Jacksonville for settlement by freedmen.\" By June, some 40,000 freedmen had been settled. \n\nIt was shortly after this that Congress finally agreed on the final version of the bill creating the Bureau, approved it and send it to Lincoln, who signed it immediately. To avoid appearing to give an unfair favoritism towards Blacks, it also took charge of White Southern refugees. More importantly for the purposes of your question, the Bureau also had the authority to divide up confiscated lands - thus its name of \"Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands.\" The Bureau now had the daunting task of dividing the four hundred thousand acres of land the government had confiscated, disposing that individuals could claim no more than 40 acres, which they could buy at the end of three years rental with \"such title thereto as the United States can convey.\"  \n\nBut, what title could it convey? Property was a right protected by the Constitution, which also prohibited bills of attainder, that is, statutes or laws that targeted a person or persons for punishment. To take away the property of the Southerners, even if they were rebels, could be interpreted as a bill of attainder. When the Second Confiscation Act was first approved, Lincoln had objected because it allowed the confiscation of both private and real property forever, without the use of courts, in the areas in rebellion. The act did limit confiscation in the Border States, disposing that only real property (i.e. slaves) could be confiscated through the legal system. Lincoln still objected, and though some Senators huffed that having the President dictate legislation was an affront to Legislative autonomy, the act was amended to allow the President to restore confiscated property through pardons and making it so that confiscation would not extend beyond a person's natural life. \n\nLincoln himself supported the Bureau as a way to protect the freedmen and prepare them for liberty, but he was not prepared to take the Radical step or redistributing lands. Nonetheless, despite Conservative pressure for overturning the Orders, he did not do so, and would continue to support the experiments in Free Labor conducted on other parts of the Union, noting that “an earlier and happier consummation than the most sanguine friends of the freedmen could reasonably expect\" had taken place. He later signed the bill that created the Bureau, and allowed the settlement of \"Shermanland\" to continue under the oversight of the abolitionist Rufus Saxton, who told the Black community that they \"were to be put in possession of lands, upon which they might locate their families and work out for themselves a living and respectability.”\n\nWe cannot know what Lincoln would have done had he been able to lead Reconstruction. He denounced the fighting over the future of the South as \"pernicious abstractions\" and focused on getting them back on the Union as fast as possible, in order to achieve peace and create governments of loyal citizens. He supported the aforementioned \"experiments\" and he wanted Louisiana to enfranchise Black veterans and literate Gens de couleur, but still allowed the restored Louisiana government to operate despite the fact that it didn't do so. In any case, Lincoln was assassinated, and Johnson was the one who took charge. The Lincoln administration had never enforced the provisions for confiscation of lands of the Second Confiscation Act, but the Bureau still had 850,000 acres of abandoned land, not enough for all freedmen, but still something that could be used to build a class of African-American free laborers."

Nuclear submarines, nuclear aircraft carriers, and nuclear power plants all generate electricity in the same way\n\nSome countries generate a significant amount of their power from nuclear energy.  France generates 40% of its electricity from its 58 nuclear reactors.\n\nExpanding capacity is hard.  New nuclear reactors are very expensive due to all the regulations and safety features that are required.  The local population doesn't understand them and is generally afraid of the radiation(which doesn't get out) and pushes back against the construction of new reactors and power plants. \n\nWe're more focused on expanding solar and wind capacity these days as they have far far less political push back and are significantly quicker and more cost effective in the short term than nuclear power",
                "It does, nuclear power plants are a thing. But what you're imagining, probably, is a personal nuclear reactor to power all of the stuff in *one* house.\n\nA nuclear reactor is really complicated and really expensive and if maintained improperly can cause a nuclear disaster; after use it generates highly radioactive waste material that needs to be disposed of (and even the government has no real solution for this!). Even if they would let you build one and fuel it with radioactive material, you would probably produce more energy than your individual house would ever use.\n\nYou might take a look at small reactors [this Wikipedia article](_URL_0_); if you click \"Gross power\" you can sort by the amount of power able to be produced: it doesn't get very small!\n\nA smaller scale nuclear-powered device is a [radioisotope thermoelectric generator](_URL_1_). Radioisotopes experience mass decay, and according to E=mc^2 they also produce energy. This has been used in spaceships going on very, very long missions. But you still have to get radioactive isotopes, so nobody would ever let you use it!",
                "Uranium fuelled reactors like the CANDU use ordinary uranium, \n\nhowever in the US, most reactors use enriched uranium for fuel, and the byproduct of that reactor can then be further processed to make nuclear weapons.\n\nStill other uranium fuelled reactors have an end product that can be isotopes used in medical testing and scientific instruments and for other scientific research purposes.\n\nAnd then there is the Thorium reactor that doesn't even use uranium. Thorium is plentiful and cheap. It also can be used as a reactor fuel, with a very intrinsically safe design, but the development costs are huge before a modern design can be standardised, and there is no military benefit from the end products."

                "It depends on what you mean by \"generate\". But...\n\nGenetic sequences don’t create cells from nothing. A genome is housed in a cell, and it got there from another genome that was housed inside a parental cell, and so on, going all the way back billions of years to the origin of cellular life. If you want to “generate” the organism from scratch, it’s not a question of pure information: you have to provide the genetic sequence with a very particular environment, that in nature would have simply been inherited from a progenitor cell. So it’s a physical problem of making and then putting thousands of different components together in very complex ways, and to do that, you’d need incredibly advanced biomolecular technology. \n\nYou also need additional information about the physical and informational structure of the organism that is not contained in the genetic sequence. (Look into [epigenetics.](_URL_0_))\n\nDepending on the complexity of the cell you want to make, generation from scratch might involve synthesizing lots of different organelles, different kinds of membranes, a microtubule framework, a cytoplasm with just the right chemical makeup, and putting all these things together in exactly the right way so the genetic sequence can operate correctly in the cell you’ve made for it. That is something far beyond our abilities at present.\n\nAnd this is only considering single cells. With multicellular organisms you’d face a whole host of problems relating to embryogenesis and development. If you think about your genetic sequence, it didn’t allow you to come into being fully formed, in an arbitrary environment. You started from a single cell in which your genome was configured epigenetically in a very specific way. Your subsequent development completely depended on being attached to a placenta inside your mother. So no, just knowing your genetic sequence doesn’t allow you to be generated in a lab somewhere.\n\nWith very simple organisms like bacteria, you can sometimes get away with substituting one genome for a quite different one, and the new instructions will still function with the foreign cellular “machinery”. There’s been a lot of work in this area, perhaps the most high profile being Craig Venter’s “Life 2.0” project, although it really falls under the heading of ‘partially synthetic organism’ rather than ‘generating life from scratch’.\n",
                "This is a really good question.\n\nEven if you have the complete DNA sequence of a molecule, it won't do anything by itself. DNA is chemically inert and needs other proteins, such as polymerases and transcription factors in order to know what to do. Not to mention how its folded in regards to nucleosomes makes a big deal on how certain regions are expressed.\n\nThe problem is really that every cell has come from a fully formed cell before it that has divided to form two cells. In order to create a brand new replicating cell we need to create both the DNA itself, and the incredibly complex chemical environment of a preformed cell. At the moment recreating am entire cell from scratch materials isn't really feasible.\n\nHowever, for simpler biological systems, specifically viruses, this is totally possible. For many viruses if you just insert their naked genome into a permissive cell you'll get infectious particles. In that sense as long as we have the sequence of the genome of a virus it's never truly extinct.\n\nAs DNA synthesizing becomes cheaper and more in-house this could actually become a problem. Any lab with access to the sequence of the smallpox genome, a DNA synthesizer, and the right cell cultures, could easily produce infectious smallpox virions.",
                "The other comments here about needing an operating cellular environment are the best answer, but just for completeness I should also mention that most genome sequencing efforts you hear about are not literally whole genome sequences. Even the most complete genome sequences, such as *Homo sapiens* or *Drosophila* fruit flies are still missing large sections of repetitive elements and heterochromatic regions. We are continually getting closer and closer to full sequence, but we're not there yet. Some people think it will actually never be possible. I tend to disagree, though there is certainly no way with our existing methods.\n\nBacteria have generally simpler genomes and genomic organization and I *think* there are complete bacterial genomes, but someone will correct me if I'm wrong about that.",
                "DNA is the code that determines the proteins/genetic traits/etc. for an organism, but the code itself is really just a basic part of a very convoluted greater system within a cell. What genes get accessed, how those proteins interact, how the cells divide, how the cells differentiate and everything else are part of complex signaling cascades. Your neurons are way different than your skin cells, even with the same DNA, due to these developmental signaling pathways. \n\nObviously when humans make a baby, we don't just form from DNA strands. We form from cells (sperm and egg) with their own DNA that fuse and activate all these pathways that are part of the (very complex) developmental process we've evolved. But take away the normal environment of fertilization, and things get a bit trickier. We've successfully cloned animals, but it took a lot of attempts and modifications aside from just replacing a cell's DNA with DNA of choice. Each species of cloned animal had different scientific hurdles that had to be overcome in order to be produced, and still other issues with the cloned animal once it was alive (which are progressively more difficult the more complex the species is). \n\nIn less complex organisms, cloning is easier. You could probably easily plop in your DNA of choice and it would go on to make an organism. But I don't know all the technical limitations involved.\n\nSo, really, you always need DNA as part of a cellular structure because the DNA doesn't really form the structures outright, it exists first in concert with them, including many proteins and their signaling pathways. DNA is not just this magic ingredient that forms an organism. It is accessed in specific ways to sort of run the \"development program\" of an organism in a very complex pattern of activation and repression of specific genes.\n",
                "This has (sort of) [already been done](_URL_0_). However, it required a functioning cell into which the synthetic DNA was implanted. So, yes - it is possible to generate an organism using synthesized DNA, but currently a host cell of the same species is required. ",
                "An organism is more than the sequence of its genome. *Much more.* \n\nIn a world where we know how to create life, let's imagine the instruction manual to do it is a great thick book called *This is Life*. Now let's imagine that some rogue ethicist breaks into the vault beneath the Declaration of Independence where the book is kept and burns it. The contents of the book are 95% destroyed, but the index and the table of contents are more or less spared. \n\nThat's about as far as knowing the sequence of an organism's genome, and the current state of molecular biology, gets you. I guess you could say we know what's in the book, and we've got bits and pieces of it, but that's it. \n\nWe don't know how to create a self-perpetuating genome (the synthetic [*Mycoplasma*](_URL_0_) cell from a few years ago was a synthetic genome that was laboriously pieced together and then inserted into an already living cell that was essentially hijacked by the synthetic genome). We don't know how to create a cell. We don't fully understand how a cell develops into an organism. Those would be, in my mind, chapters one, two, and three in *This is Life*. There would be many, many more chapters. \n\nMolecular biology is an extremely immature science. You could argue it only really got going in 1953, when the structure of DNA was determined. You could further argue it didn't *really* get going until the 1970s when restriction enzymes were first characterized. Simply put, we don't know nearly enough. Not remotely. ",
                "\"Generating it\" could mean many things. Let's break the question into a few smaller bits:\n\n**(1) Can we be sure we know the genetic sequence?** We can be pretty confident, but there is a snag when it comes to repeated regions. Sequencing costs have come down enormously over the past decade, but current techniques rely on sequencing many randomly generated short segments and then using a computer to identify where they overlap to build the genome sequence. Eukaryotic genomes often have long regions of repeated DNA, so if the short segments of DNA you sequence are shorter than the length of the repeated region, you will never know how many repeats the original genome had. On top of this, the genome isn't quite fixed between cells of one organism, with small alterations building up between the stem cells in different regions as you age. These problems are less of a concern in bacteria, but they might pose a larger challenge for making synthetic multicellular life.\n\n**(2) Can we generate the genetic sequence synthetically?** Yes. We can only directly synthesize a few hundred bases before errors start to become very common. But thanks to tricks like [Gibson assembly](_URL_2_), we can make those short synthetic DNA bits assemble into longer sequences. Again, there is a challenge when it comes to long stretches of repetitive DNA, because the reassembled DNA might skip a repeated section and these regions can shorten easily during PCR amplification, but these are technical challenges that money/time can overcome.\n\n**(3) Can we put the synthetic genome inside a pre-existing cell and make it work?** This is at the edge of our abilities now. More than 10 years ago viable polio virus was created from [synthetic DNA](_URL_0_). Other commenters mentioned the success of [Gibson et al.](_URL_1_) in generating viable bacteria using synthetic DNA. But doing this with other species will be trickier. DNA in multicellular organisms needs to have much more epigenetic regulation than in single-celled organisms. That is because your neurons, skin cells, muscle cells, etc. all have (very nearly) the exact same DNA in them. The epigenetic differences are what differentiates those cells from each other. Large portions of the genome have to be silenced in a viable cell, and different regions are silenced in different cells. This silencing is accomplished through many different mechanisms working at the same time, and there is much we don't understand. Even taking existing differentiated cells and and turning them back into stem cells (called [induced pluripotent stem cells](_URL_3_)) is very difficult. Getting a full \"sequence\" of all the epigenetic features of a cell line is beyond our current abilities right now. If we just tried to exchange a synthetic genome of naked DNA into, say, mouse cells, the cells would be reading all the wrong bits of DNA at once.\n\n**(4) Can we synthesize the rest of the cell?** As in, how far away are we from generating life from direct synthesis of not just DNA, but the proteins, membranes, etc.? This is far, far beyond what we can do. Cells are extremely efficient factories for generating complex molecules and assembling them into larger functioning units. And we don't even know everything that is in a cell. This would be like asking a child with a lego set to build a Tesla.\n\n**tl/dr** Some simple life forms can be generated from synthetic DNA right now, but for multicellular organisms this will be much harder.",
                "It might not be a decent analogy, but it would be like writing a book based on the index. You have all the information on what's in there, and you can compared to other books from it, but without the rules of writing, or the context for those words, you can't build the book. \n\nAs others say, a genetic sequence is not the full information for an organism, you need much more interesting things on top. The genome is just a remarkably simple looking basis. ",
                "For say a human, there's the issue of gestation. You'd need to have the mother completely simulated. In order to have the organism truly generated you'd have to generated the mother (otherwise its not true to \"generating it\" with no parent) and you'd still need to make the egg and sperm combine in such a way as to create that set of DNA.",
                "DNA is, in the sense you're looking at it, not much more than a blueprint that came along well after the development of cells and allowed a subset of them to have a stable enough genome that they could form complex and stable multicellular organisms. It's a latecomer.\n\nThe real functional star of the show, as far as genetic material goes, is RNA, which is less stable but much more versatile than DNA. DNA's function is to act as a stable, readable record; almost every other function carried out via genetic material is done via RNA, and there is a significant amount of information encoded in the relative quantities of RNA sequences, not just their codes.\n\nIn order to replicate the genome, assuming you have also advanced modern science far enough already to create a cell from scratch, you need the DNA sequence and a pool of RNA as finely-tuned as 4 billion years already made it.",
                "Others have given excellent replies particularly about the problems of building from DNA, but I didn't see any mention of epigenetics. \n\nThe complete genetic sequence of an organism contains active and inactive genes. Only active genes are expressed and used during synthesis. The so-called epigenetics of what is enabled and what is not comes partly from the environment and partly from inheritance and it may also change through development. If all the genes were expressed at the same time, the result may not even be viable as a mammalian pluripotent (non-specialized) embryonic cell has enough information to become any part of the body: heart, brain, eye or whatever. Clearly it cannot be all at once and be viable.",
                "It's like having a cookbook which tells you specifically how to create a particular million-course ultra-gourmet meal, but not having a kitchen.\n\nAnd yes, this could be possible - but we need to figure out how to build a sufficiently extensive kitchen first. Right now we have the equivalent of half a chopstick and a home-made candle."

                "I think this is going to be quite a subjective ranking, but Wild West towns during mineral rushes are certainly strong contenders. I know mainly about the mineral rushes in Colorado and then the Yukon Gold Rush, but I'm sure that a look into the history of the 49ers in California would reveal similar places that briefly were truly lawless. These were places that sprang up nearly overnight -- the hasty construction of the town of Creede, Colorado, was so poor that the entire town burned one night in 1892 -- that had no customs, family structures, religious or other charitable institutions, etc. already established in them. They attracted desperate people hoping to make a fortune, often in a get-rich-quick way, and then the inevitable businesses that followed: brothels, saloons, and gambling parlors all appeared to part the miners with what little money they might have made. With new people pouring in every day -- the trains coming into Denver's Union Station in the 1880s were packed, day and night -- there were always new arrivals ready to be fleeced. Official institutions like sheriffs couldn't keep up with the influx of new people to hitherto deserted or sparsely-inhabited places, and politicians were often easily corrupted with the promise of getting rich quick. \n\nThe infamous Soapy Smith -- whose wikipedia tagline really sums him up, so apologies for the wiki quote: \n\n >  Jefferson Randolph \"Soapy\" Smith II (November 2, 1860 – July 8, 1898) was a famous con artist, saloon and gambling house proprietor, gangster and crime boss\n\n-- personifies the kinds of activities that were common in these frontier towns. He worked out of Denver, Colorado, Creede, Colorado, and lastly Skagway, Alaska, during mineral rushes in those towns. He notoriously controlled Denver politics from the late 1870s until he moved to Creede in 1892. He gained his nickname \"Soapy\" for a scam he ran involving the selling of soap on the streets of Denver. Later, he operated out of the Tivoli Club at the corner of 17th and Market (not to be confused with the current location of the Tivoli Brewing Company on the Auraria campus). You can see some cool old photos of it [here](_URL_1_). The Tivoli Club was a gambling den where the house always won, and because Soapy and his associates controlled Denver city elections, it was allowed to operate, despite strong protest from the press, who dubbed it the \"slaughter pen\" because of how much unchecked violence took place there. In fact, one thing that had originally drawn Soapy to Denver in 1879 was its lax restrictions on gambling. \n\nEventually, however, Soapy's operation became too well known, and the politicians he had previously controlled were forced by public/media outcry to pass stronger gambling laws. So, in 1892, Soapy headed south to the town of Creede, Colorado, which was in the midst of a silver boom. The town went from a population of 600 in 1889 to more than 10,000 people in December 1891, and was famous as a place where it was never night -- it's in a narrow canyon, and the lights from the saloons, brothels, and other gambling establishments going all night reflected off the canyon walls. Soapy quickly established himself as the crime boss in the town and used that power to try to run out other outlaws. The sheriff, William Sidney \"Cap\" Light, was Soapy's brother-in-law. \n\nAs I said above, Creede burned down -- going from [this](_URL_2_) to [this](_URL_0_) (sorry, can't embed that last image). There's a great image in the Denver Museum of Nature and Science Rocks and Minerals section if you ever get a chance to go there that shows that main street in Creede jam-packed with people. After the town was destroyed, it was quickly rebuilt, but a silver panic in 1893 combined with Denver loosening its gambling laws yet again put an end to this lawless, frontier-period there as train-loads of eager miners stopped arriving and the criminal element, including Soapy, migrated back to Denver. \n\nSo there are two examples of essentially \"lawless\" places for certain times and places in history. I can tell you more anecdotes about similar towns, like Skagway, Alaska, where Soapy died in a gunfight four days after appearing in a parade with the mayor, or Leadville, Colorado, briefly the most populated place in Colorado during the silver boom and where Doc Holliday was exonerated by a jury after shooting the local deputy dead over $5. But beyond just anecdotes, I think what unifies these stories is the conditions, like I described above, that allowed lawlessness to flourish -- and note that they are not stable situations and that once the mineral rushes had ended, they became lawful towns once again. \n\nIf you'd like to read an amazing piece of historical fiction set partially in Colorado during this time and a little later, I highly recommend Thomas Pynchon's *Against the Day*. \n\nAll that being said, I'm sure other lawless locations include places in the aftermath of wars, or even during them (like in Syria right now) -- any time that normal society is interrupted, often by an influx of large numbers of desperate people and people who are ready and able to take advantage of them (two groups which presumably have a lot of overlap)."

This view was later criticized or apologized for by later indian astronomers, who clearly lacked the insights Aryabhatta had.\n\nAnd the ancient's idea of expressing all orbits of planets around the sun suggest a precursor of a Heliocentric theory. This however did not develop fully, as Aryabhatta continued the use of variable epicycles, which even though being a better system than Ptolemy's, shows that it was still an earth centric model for all calculation purposes.",

For example when Eratosthenes [calculated the circumference of the Earth](_URL_0_)...\n\n > Eratosthenes calculated the circumference of the Earth without leaving Egypt. Eratosthenes knew that, on the summer solstice, at local noon in the Ancient Egyptian city of Swenet (known in Greek as Syene, and in the modern day as Aswan) on the Tropic of Cancer, the sun would appear at the zenith, directly overhead (he had been told that the shadow of someone looking down a deep well would block the reflection of the Sun at noon). \n\n > Using a gnomon, he measured the sun's angle of elevation at noon on the solstice in his hometown of Alexandria, and found it to be 1/50th of a circle (7°12') south of the zenith. He could have used a compass to measure the angle of the shadow cast. Assuming that the Earth was spherical (360°), and that Alexandria was due north of Syene, he concluded that the meridian arc distance from Alexandria to Syene must therefore be 1/50 = 7°12'/360°, and was therefore 1/50 of the total circumference of the Earth.\n\nSo basically with a sundial and the memory of when the sun was directly overhead somewhere else, he more-or-less figured out the size of the planet. He was a little off because his assumption of a spherical Earth was incorrect (among other things) but his reasoning was almost spot-on:\n\n > If Eratosthenes calculation is performed with the correct data, the result is 40,074 km. This is 66 km of difference (0.16%) from the current aproximation of the Earth's circumference."

                "Because it was a ruse.\n\nSeveral leaders and juntas, but not all, in the many wars of independence in Latin America in the early 19th century used a supposed loyalty to Fernando VII to grow their base of support that in many cases were not clamouring for independence or had any ill-will towards the king. Through this, juntas and leaders could proclaim home rule in the name of Fernando VII in opposition to the illegitimate monarch installed by Napoleon after 1808.\n\nMiguel Hidalgo certainly took advantage of this \"mask of Fernando\" (as its known historiographically) to shield himself and the nascent independence movement in New Spain from any accusations of disloyalty towards the king. Although Hidalgo did not take pleasure in putting on the mask of Fernando VII, he mixed loyalty to the monarchy with attacks against Europeans (*Gachupines*) in New Spain in his famous speech in Dolores. This worked wonders for Hidalgo and revolutionary movements around Latin American who appealed to loyalty to the king. It might seem strange to us as to why revolutionaries would spout a different ideology than the one they truly wanted to achieve, but a closer look at the contemporary context of warring movements and even governments meant that in those fateful first years of the independence conflicts, you had to thread a fine line so as to not lose supporters to other groups, sometimes as close as a different junta in a different city. Furthermore, we can't assume that all revolutionary leaders and juntas were looking following *republican* principles. José de San Martín, for example, was far more interested in a constitutional monarchy than a republic.\n\nPredictably to us now, the ruse sooner or later stopped working and many threw off the mask when the time was right. This included Hidalgo who stopped evoking Fernando VII's name to gather support for his movement."

This means that a wing suit would have a glide ratio better than that of the Space Shuttle, and on par with a commercial airliner, but not as high as a sailplane.~~\nthe glide ratio will remain the same, but the amount of power required to sustain flight will be reduced by a factor of about 15.\n\n*It should be noted that there are powered wing suits that can fly on Earth, so those would obviously fly under their own power in this scenario, though it's not by flapping.\n\nAlso, since you're building a hypothetical giant pressurized building, you could increase the density of air to further manipulate things.  With higher density, it gets easier to fly, and at extreme densities, \"swimming\" through the atmosphere becomes possible, although at those densities, the pressure would cause other problems.\n\n**Edit:**  Many have pointed out that I didn't answer the question in terms of \"flapping power.\"  To my knowledge, there is no existing suit capable of this, so it would be speculation to try to answer that exact question. (There was a [guy](_URL_0_) who claimed to do exactly this, but I believe he later admitted it was a hoax.)\n\nIf the question was reworded to just mean in terms of general human-powered flight, /u/asdf90j2309jasdf answers the question with calculations for hovering [down here](_URL_1_).",
                "I think you'll find a lot of answers you're looking for in [this](_URL_0_) xkcd. It has more to do with air density, so there are a couple planets/moons in the solar system where you could do this without an enclosed structure. \n\nI think it's important to specify how pressurized you're talking; theoretically, an enclosed, pressurized structure on planet earth would be suitable for human powered flight as well.",

Since things weigh 6x less on the Moon, then one could maintain a hover if they weigh less than 156 lbs on the Earth, assuming 100% efficiency and not including the weight of the machine. So, I think it would be possible to build a helicopter bicycle that you could fly if you're fit enough, but you would have to pedal so hard that you would get exhausted quickly. It would be a trip that lasts but a few moments.",
                "Nobody has answered the question of what sort of thrust a human could make with a wingsuit.  I'd suspect it's only a few fractions of a pound.  I'm not even sure you'd develop enough forward airspeed to make the efficient wingsuits inflate on the moon.\n\nNow, could you fly on your own power?  Definitely.  You can do that in earth gravity.  For long periods.  (Eg; gossamer albatross)  Instead of needing 1/4hp you could do it on 1/24hp.  1/12hp is something that even \"untrained humans\" can develop.  So \"everyone\" could pedal a plan around your theoretical stadium.  \n\nCan a human develop 1/24hp with their arm and chest muscles?  That's another question.  And one I suspect is a \"yes.\"  So you could be Icarus if you felt like it."

                "Eating brains does run a higher risk than eating muscle or other organs, but that risk is still very low. If you read about the epidemiology of Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD), the most common prion disease, the incidence was 1 in 1,000,000 from 1979 to 1994 and 5 in 1,000,000,000 in those under the age of 30 in the US. With that said, CJD is is thought to have a 20-50 year incubation period which could explain why it's so rare in young people. I think more supportive (or contradictory) evidence of this will start appearing in the 2000-2040 time frame (20-50 years after) the UK 80s-90s outbreak and those that ate that tainted beef.\n\nTesting for BSE in cattle and discarding those that have the disease helps protect those that eat cattle organs (particularly the brain).  \n\nTLDR: It's all about statistical probability and the risk of a prion disease infection is very low.",
                "Tougher for the prions to transmit from cows to humans, however, cultures like the \"Fore\" in Papua New Guinea experienced much higher rates of prion-related diseases, [Kuru](_URL_0_), because they used to consume the body and brains of their deceased. Ironically, they only would participate in this ritual if the deceased looked healthy upon their death, and Kuru had a side effect of 'marbling' muscle making it more appetizing--only leading to the continuing spread of the disease. \n\nSource--wrote a research paper on Kuru and CJD for a physio class",
                "In addition to what others have written, a major problem with the 90s  outbreak was how modern western food systems operate. \n\nFor one, cows in many places were being given meat, bone and feather meal in their feed that may have been contaminated and may have spread the disease. On their natural diet of grass, cows may still spontaneously develop a prion disease, but it would be less likely. \n\nSecondly, meat products now often involve blending of meat from from different cows. That effectively multiplies the chances by however many individual cows contribute to a particular hamburger. When eating a brain, however, it is likely just a single cow involved."

                "There are a couple of things that happened, but mainly there's one thing, the rise of colonial rebellion.\n\nDuring WW2, France fell and resulted in one terrible thing, Free France was fighting for France and left the colonies to their own devices. These colonial holdings generally fought with the Allies (with North Africa siding with Vichy due to proximity and German invasion later on to support the Italians). With Free France fighting the Axis, the colonial holdings got used to being left alone. Combined with this, France was giving fuel to anti-French forces within these colonies due to neglect and long building anti-French sentiment building from the turn of the 20th century.\n\nWith France liberated, the focus was on the White French that fought over the years, pushing aside the many non-white soldiers that fought and bled over the years. Charles de Gaulle even told General Leclerc to find more white soldiers since many of his soldiers were from Central and North Africa. Naturally this would also alienate many of those soldiers that were suddenly finding themselves as inferior to the few white French that fought with them, something General Leclerc voiced.\n\nSo, with France secure, the French wanted to return back to normal but as usual that wouldn't happen. Many of the colonies had been pushing France away, including major players like French Indochina and Algeria in the early to mid fifties. In the attempt of trying to neutralize these threats, the wars would turn against France and cause the public opinion to change against them in favor of independence, leading to a Constitutional Crisis that stems from the Algerian crisis.\n\nWith a new Constitution led by Charles de Gaulle, France would politically settle in respect to their governmental position, but this doesn't mean that France is done. De Gaulle wanted to return France into a major world power. This would lead to many things, such as a strong military (which is still one of the premier forces in Europe and a major arms dealer in the world), a strong focus on atomic power to ensure no fuel dependency (as France has a high number of nuclear power plants), and a strong political position in the new Post-War/Post Independence Crisis Europe. All of these are major tenants of Gaullism that would become a major political ideology within France that was neither truly left or right. De Gaulle was more conservative but still asserted republican ideology within France and a unified ideal of France that is more patriotic than ideological.\n\nThis focus on a strong, unified, and powerful France would of course have problems with many other groups. France \"left\" NATO but only because of the American command structure that effectively had America as the leader of NATO. De Gaulle didn't like that and an American focus on equipment so France effectively pulled out of NATO, but never truly did as they made agreements with NATO to support NATO if there was any attack made by the Soviets.\n\nThe 20th Century wasn't the kindest to France. France hadn't industrialized as quickly as the rest of Europe and lost the population advantage they had during the early 19th century. Combined with the extreme loss of life during the First World War and the general ineffective interwar government made France ripe to be easily defeated during the Second World War. However France would recover thanks to de Gaulle.\n\nEdit: Forgot Sources\n\n*Free France's Lion: The Life of Philippe Leclerc, de Gaulle's Greatest General* by William Moore.\n\n*France and the French: A Modern History* by Rod Kedward"

                "The short answer would be that individual police officers aren't individually liable in most circumstances.  You can't sue them individually (well, you can, but it will be quickly thrown out).  Exceptions may apply in some limited situations.\n\nBasically, a police officer is an agent of the state, unlike a doctor or lawyer. As such, what they do is basically covered by the state.\n\nLots of people think that this is a bad idea, and that officers should be individually liable.  But the risks here are real.  A rich person may freely sue every officer that interacts with him, and \"out-lawyer\" them, eventually ensuring that no police officer will mess with them.  If you sue a department, the department has access to a much larger budget, oftentimes it's own legal staff, a large group insurance across many agencies, and at the end of the day the taxpayer. An individual officer has only access to his own paycheck, which are generally far more modest than those of lawyers and doctors. \n\nWhile protections for police officers and other often get a bad rap, and they often get a bad rap for good reasons, getting rid of the those protections also risks a return to the days when police weren't professionals, but rather jobs handed out to cronies and political supporters of elected officials, who may also become that elected officials private army.  That's bad.  Police officers require some degree of insulation from the fact that 99% of the people they talk to aren't happy to see them. \n\nDo some police officers abuse their limited liability?  Certainly.  But the solution is to remove those officers, not to destroy the system because of a few bad eggs."

But this is an example of a system where even the tiniest change can result in huge differences in the end results. Where and how the ball is dropped is different in a minuscule way which completely changes its path through the machine.

We simply represent one of many possible solutions to a particular problem.\n\nFor comparison, consider the marsupial mammals of australia and the placental mammals of africa. These environments are very similar and in each environment, there are categories of animals that have evolved to exploit particular niches. For example, there is a niche for living underground and eating worms. Thus the mole and the marsupial mole. Not closely related at all, but they have many common features such as very large front claws, because they are solving similar problems. For a more disparate example, consider the niche for large grazing animals. Africa spawned antelopes, etc; Australia spawned kangaroos.

                "Hello there ! \n\nThat perception of things comes from common misconceptions.\n\nFirst of all, the sense of the word tyrant have evolved since medieval times. It originates from Greek and originally meant someone that came to power out of legitimate ways, such as succession or election. With time it acquired the idea of absolute power and, finally, of oppression. Yet the Greeks, in general, did not see tyrants as necessarily \"evil\". It was, rather, one form of government, although probably not the best even by their standards. It is only with time that the word tyrant acquired its meaning of oppressing, dictatorial rule.\n\nThat is important, because medieval and Renaissance philosopher, surrounded and very fond of classical authors, may very well refer to the classical sense of tyranny. \n\nNow, if you apply that prism to their discourse, you will see that it generally does not aim at kings, for they came to power *via* legitimate ways (in this case, succession). Therefore, they are not \"textbook\" tyrants, for the lack one key component : illegitimacy.\n\nNow for the second misconception, I'll send you [here](_URL_0_), to an answer I've already written on the subject. The general idea, though, is that medieval kings would likely not really be considered tyrants, even by our modern standards. Their power was far less absolute than what we like to imagine and they had to deal with many counter-powers : nobility, administration, Church, deputies of the bourgeoisie, ... That would of course differ from one place to another, so keep in mind I'm speaking mostly about medieval France here.\n\nOne key element of the tyrant classical definition that we overlooked earlier is the idea that the tyrant, although he doesn't abolish laws, keeps himself above them. They do not really apply to him. That is NOT the case for French king (and English king were rather less absolute rulers). Laws, customs, rights and local specificity were to be respected, even by the king. \n\nI'll give you an example, too. In early XVth century France, the king Charles VI is stricken by madness. He has prolonged periods of delirium and depression, with short remission periods in between. Therefore, the kingdom is ruled by his \"private council\" : top nobles and administrators. In this council, two men oppose each other. Louis d'Orléans, the king's brother, and Jean de Bourgogne, the king's cousin. They are the two wealthiest and most powerful lords of France at the time. \n\nSince the king is not dead and his very person is sacred, he can not be removed from office, and no regent can be appointed. Therefore, he who controls the council controls the kingdom, and specifically the lucrative pensions that can be generously granted to himself. \n\nAt the beginning, the scales weighs in favor of Louis d'Orléans, who manages to assert his control on the council. Civil war is avoided in 1405, but the tension remains extreme.\n\nIn 1407, Louis d'Orléans is assassinated in a trap in the middle of Paris. The assassins are tracked back to the house of the Jean de Bourgogne, who rides out of the capital in haste.\n\nHe is summoned by the council and the king to be judged, and he finally comes. But with him is Jean Petit, a theologian from the Sorbonne. Jean Petit has redacted an \"Apology of tyrannicide\". In this speech, he explains that indeed Louis d'Orléans was a tyrant, considering himself above the laws, acting against the will of the king, favoring his own interest rather than the people's and generally trying to gather absolute power. Therefore, he concludes, he who had the tyrant slain is a hero. That, of course, scandalizes the nobility, because Jean de Bourgogne had his own cousin murdered and he confesses it **proudly**, yet it shows you the differences between our \"modern tyrants\" and what medieval philosophers would call a tyrant (since Jean Petit used their definition of tyranny).\n\n & #x200B;\n\nI hope that answered your question !\n\nI did provide some references in the linked post, but if you need I think I could provide some on this specific topic. Just let me know."

With a Chinese lead bank, Chinese state owned resource companies and development companies will get a better shot at contracts.\n\nEdit: Another thing is China's foreign reserve is full of US treasury bonds, which is not paying any interest at all right now. Putting some of it in the new bank will probably get them a higher interest rate than 0, even if they lose some of it.",
                "It means, in a basic sense, that nations will be able to go to an Eastern-led development bank instead of Western banks such as the World Bank and IMF (as you mentioned). Since countries usually agree to certain development terms when they receive loans from these places, the issuer of the loan gains control over the development process to a certain extent. Furthermore, since these banks are Western the development parameters will be much more Western-friendly, such as free trade with the US and EU, or growth in a market that would benefit the West. \n\nA Chinese/Eastern development bank would give an alternative to the Western approach. Whether it would be good or bad for developing countries is yet to be seen, but I believe competition usually breeds a positive outcome (lower interest rates, less strict requirements on loans). In either case, it would take away some power the West holds over certain developing countries. Also, it gives countries shunned by the West access to large development banks granted the Chinese/East are willing to put up with them (Iran, Venezuela).",
                "The Bretton Woods system of the IMF, World Bank,  and such,  grew out of World War 2.  With Europe and Asia trashed, the US was positioned to take the lead in economic growth,  and coerced the rest of world to adopt the dollar (and gold) as the trade currency. Having the dollar be the currency of the world Trade is very beneficial to the country in control of that currency.  \n\nTo use the system,  you have to abide by \"Western\" rules. Most of the West is developed, and makes their money by moving money around and giving it to developing countries. Developed countries don't have to rape and pillage the land to get ahead,  developing countries do. \n\nDeveloping countries don't like to be told that they can't do what they want and what they think they need to, in order to get to where developed countries are. The west was allowed to burn their forests,  pollute the water,  and force children to work.  Why can't developing countries? \n\n Bretton Woods system forces countries to abide by a 70 year old system, one beneficial  to the US,  and one some think is artificially limiting. \n\nThe repercussions of the growth of the AIIB , and the fall of the Bretton Woods? Who knows. Maybe having competition is good and allows both systems to serve different needs. Maybe having an alternative allows a country to have its needs met by the other and everyone wins. More likely,  the banking systems are tied up with the new cold war and the political aims of their parent country.  Instead of proxy wars through Asia between the Americans and the Soviets,  there are proxy banking wars between the US and China. ",

But it's not just a light tap, it has to strike with a decent amount of force.  In order to do that, the hammer (the part you cock back on a pistol, [highlighted here](_URL_2_) is spring-loaded.  When you cock it, the hammer is pulled against the spring and held in place until you pull the trigger, which releases the hammer, which hits the firing pin (or is attached to it), which hits the primer...etc.\n\nThere are two ways dropping a handgun can cause it to fire.  If the hammer is cocked and you drop it, you may jar the hammer so that it slips past the mechanism holding it back, in which case it slams into the firing pin just like it's supposed to do, as if you had pulled the trigger.  That is not good, and it's also why you should never keep your firearm cocked until you're ready to use it.  But as u/NO_LATTE_NO_PEACE pointed out, many pistols are double-action, so you don't have to cock the hammer first.  The hammer is cocked *as you pull the trigger* until you reach a point in the swing of the trigger that releases the hammer.  If it's an automatic or semi-automatic weapon, the firing action reloads the gun and cocks the hammer again.  Single-action weapons, like the revolvers of the old west, require you to cock the hammer each time you want to fire, before you pull the trigger.\n\nSo if you're carrying a weapon for personal defense, it's probably going to be a double-action, in which case you can carry it without it being cocked and you don't have to worry about wasting the time to cock it.  Single-action weapons are generally considered to be simpler and more reliable.  But that's neither here nor there.\n\nThe other way a weapon might fire when dropped is if it lands directly on the hammer.  In that case, when the hammer hits the ground and transfers the energy of the drop into the hammer, it pushes the hammer against the firing pin with a lot of force, exactly as if the hammer had been released by the trigger.  The floor hits the hammer, which hits the firing pin, which hits the primer...etc.  However, most modern weapons will not allow the firing pin to touch the back of the cartridge unless the hammer has been cocked first.  There is a mechanism in place that gets between the hammer and the firing pin or prevents the hammer from moving forward unless it's been cocked and/or the trigger is pulled.  With those weapons, you can bang on it as hard as you want and it will not go off... \\*\n\n\\* Until the gunpowder ignites from the shock, which is a thing gunpowder can do.  It's *possible* that if you dropped a gun from high enough the sheer force of hitting the ground would set off the gunpowder, but...that's not a realistic possibility.  It certainly won't happen from you dropping it from your hand onto the ground.\n\nIt *used* to be more common, partly because guns were not designed with the safety features to prevent the firing pin from touching the cartridge.  Older guns simply rested the firing pin against the back of the cartridge, and the hammer against the firing pin when it wasn't cocked.  Obviously, this is pretty unsafe, but hey, guns were still being improved upon so no one had anything better at the time.  We have also significantly improved our understanding of gun safety when we handle weapons so people to know better than to keep a gun cocked when you aren't about to immediately fire it, and technologies like double-action weapons have allowed people to be more comfortable because they don't need to have the weapon cocked before the gunfight starts.  Today it's very uncommon, unless someone is mishandling the gun, the mechanism is malfunctioning, or most likely, both.",
                "Some older single action revolvers when fully loaded with 6 rounds have the firing pin resting on the primer of one of the bullets. Since they have no safety, a bump on the hammer can fire the bullet. Modern revolvers have a safety that blocks the firing pin from the primer until the trigger is pulled. \n\nHere is a good demonstration of this _URL_0_\n",
                "It was somewhat true in the days of old with revolvers where the hammer rested close or directly on the primer of a cartridge. But in modern weapons misfires from dropping have been almost eliminated. There was a recall on Remington 700 rifles because they were causing misfired without pulling the trigger, but only when it was cocked and not on safe. Again though it was recalled. \n\nThe mechanism that stops misfires from the hammer directly contacting the primer is very present in the M9/ 92FS series pistols that the military uses. The weapon will not fire unless the trigger is pulled. There is a piece of metal in between the firing pin and the primer of the bullet. This piece will only move unless the trigger is pulled because the trigger is directly connected to this piece. So I can slam the pistol down, throw it, or otherwise try to cause a misfire and it will not unless that trigger is pulled. It also helps that the trigger is fairly heavy, so it falling cannot cause enough energy to transfer into the trigger for it to get pulled, which is what was causing the misfires in the Remington rifles. ",
                "Nope.  This is Hollywood nonsense. Modern guns do not discharge when they hit the ground.  In fact, most people will tell you that if you drop a gun it is safer to let it just hit the ground than attempt to catch it.  \n\nThe only times a gun will discharge on impact is (1) you are using an antique gun design, like a Colt SAA or (2) the gun is damaged and mechanically defective.\n\nThat scene in True Lies with the Mac 10 is total nonsense.",
                "It depends on the gun. Some do though. When people think of  gun they tend to think of something like a revolver or an 1911 pistol, both of which have a hammer that gets pulled back in order to fire. Many guns use an internal firing pin though that is not like a hammer, its more like a spring loaded nail that gets pulled back and compresses a spring, and when you fire, the sharp pin is pushed forward by the spring and strikes the firing cap on the back of the round. \n\nWhen a gun is dropped it is possible for the shock of landing to push the firing pin back only to have the spring snap it forward again, firing the weapon. You have to put a specific mechanism in place that doesn't allow the firing pin to move unless the trigger is squeezed. \n\nFor instance I own a Glock 17c which has a little mechanism on the trigger and the firing pin cannot strike unless the trigger is depressed. So a Glock cannot fire from dropping it if it's working properly. The Glock does not have a manual safety though so if it is cocked, it will always fire if the trigger is pulled and there is no way to prevent that other than to eject the magazine and un-chamber the round. Glock owners will usually tell you that with a Glock the safety is 'between your ears' IE you don't put your finger on the trigger unless you are prepared to destroy what it is aiming at. \n\nGuns like the 1911 on the other hand can block the hammer and prevent the weapon from discharging, but if there is a firing pin it doesn't always immobilize it so it's possible if struck against the ground for the weapon to fire even safed.

                "I saw your previous question,  I'm glad you came back for another shot. \n\nThe long and short of it comes down to *how small* of a group is required for oligarchy. Certainly for the first 145 or so years of US history, only a minority of citizens had the legal right to vote. This started with white, male property owners. The last property requirements for voting were finally abolished shortly before the Civil War. Then, for another 55 years after that, women were still not given the franchise until the passage of the 19th amendment in 1920. Only at this point can we safely say that a majority of American citizens had the legal right to cast a vote at the ballot box - that is, all white people. Of course, African-Americans were only given actual access to the ballot box in the 60s with the Civil Rights Movement and the Voting Rights Act. But this is just the legal sense of the term; it's just who has the theoretical legal right to vote, not who *actually votes*. \n\nGiven that voter turnout for presidential elections generally hovers in the high 50% range, and that it is much, much lower for off-year Congressional, all state, and all locals elections, one could convincingly make the argument that only a small group of people are *actually* exercising any control over the government through the ballot box, regardless of whether or not those people who are not taking part have a right to do so or not. \n\nAll of this doesn't even touch on the question of class - whether the \"rich and powerful\" or \"special interests\" are able to use their influence to the detriment of the rest. I'm sure there are lots of arguments that can be made for and against that claim, and I'm just not qualified - or willing - to jump down that rabbit hole at the moment. "

This is how new flu viruses are thought to come about, they mix and match their genes and re-emerge as new, more virulent strains.\n\nSome viruses can ONLY reproduce when its co infecting. The best example I know of this is Hepatitis D virus. By itself, it can do nothing, but if it infects along side Hep B virus, it can spread. It uses some of the Hep B machinery and Hep B surface proteins. ",
                "Yes this is possible. And it can have some terrifying effects.\n\nTracing HIV back to its origins (by looking at similar viruses), it appears that 2 monkey viruses, from 2 different species of monkey, were present in the same cell at the same time and mutated together. This mutant hybrid of both viruses made its way into a human (probably through a monkey bite).\n\nThis is not particularly hard for viruses to bond together, especially retro-viruses like HIV. They don't have DNA, they're just a chain of RNA that hijacks a ribosome to replicate. Since they're jacking the system, it's easy for \"normal\" protein synthesis to get disturbed and 2 virus chains to conjoin - well, much easier than the same thing occurring between Eukaryote genes."

                "They can't, which is why literary scholars around the 1940s, in the era called \"new criticism,\" thought authorial intent was irrelevant. Now, literary theory has changed a lot since then and many might say that the new critics went too far, but you still aren't going to find \"what was the author thinking?\" to be a primary question in academic circles very often.\n\nI mean, even if you have an interview with the author where he says \"This book is about true love.\" the author might become cynical when they are older and say \"Actually, I had no idea what true love was when I wrote that.

A good example (not painting related) is the amount of scholarship on the music and performance style of JS Bach that is based entirely on his local church's records of payments made to musicians each week. This seems like a random piece of information but it enables us to know how many actual human beings Bach had to work with, the constraints he had to manage, and his *likely* thought processes in writing his music. This actually led to a revolution over the past ~20 years in how his music is performed. "

                "So this is kind of a complex question and I have done my best to answer it by referring to the history of memorial representations in Cambodia following the Khmer Rouge being toppled in 1979. To summarise, it was a politicised image \\- and one that has been built upon by a succession of journalists and now foreign tourists. It is also a visually striking image and one utilised to inform in a very base/human way the almost unfathomable suffering of the Democratic Kampuchea period. \n\nThe image of the skull, or skulls \\- or piles of skulls \\- had been adopted by Mai Lam, who was a Vietnamese Colonel fluent in Khmer and had extensive experience in legal studies and museology, from the earliest points after the S\\-21 security centre was turned into the 'tuol sleng museum of genocidal crimes'. A large painting of a map of Cambodia, filled with skulls, and rivers of blood was on display until 2002, similar paintings hang in the museum today. The crimes of the Khmer Rouge were politicised by the new government in Cambodia which was essentially under Vietnamese suzerainty. Without going into too much detail \\- there is a reason that the museum at S\\-21 was made to be very reminiscent of museums associated with Nazi concentration camps. The idea of the exhibit was to \\(according to David Chandler\\) 'deny the the leaders of the CPK \\(communist party of kampuchea\\) any socialist credentials and encourage viewers to make connections between the DK regime \\(democratic Kampuchea\\) and Tuol Sleng on the one hand and Nazi Germany and Auschwitz on the other'. Remember at this time the communist Vietnamese were seen in some circles to have invaded Cambodia illegitimately \\(The US and China managed to keep the KR in their seat at the UN\\). The PRK government in Cambodia based its legitimacy on the fact that it had toppled a 'genocidal regime' \\(rather than a callous, radically marxist one\\), however it was in no position to condemn the entire movement as so many prominent figures in this new government were former Khmer Rouge Cadre until they had defected to Vietnam in 1977 and 1978.\n\nSo you have a situation wherein the new government is trying its hardest to be highly explicit in its condemnation of the very top leaders of the Khmer Rouge, they were tried in absentia and sentenced to death in 1979 in the first tribunal to accuse the 'Pol Pot Ieng Sary Clique' of genocide \\(the second is ongoing\\). In evidencing these accusations it became prudent to highlight to the world what the worst aspects of the Khmer Rouge period were \\- and one of the most straightforward ways of doing this would be to expose and excavate the hundreds of thousands of dead bodies which had been victims of execution during the regime. The so called 'killing fields' were dug up, and photographed. It is way too cynical to say that this was only done to prove a political point \\- obviously there is an historical and human element to digging up this tragedy \\- but when you visit places like Tuol Sleng, or its accompanying murder site Cheoung Ek \\(or the Killing Caves at Phnom Sampeau that you seem to be referencing in your question\\), the very explicit exhibits of bones and skulls stacked up behind glass is meant to viscerally remind the onlooker of the tragedy that befell Cambodia \\(and maybe who stopped it as well\\).\n\nI'm afraid I cannot right now give you an accurate answer as to when these images of skull piles began to be a prominent image associated with Cambodia. The Toul Sleng museum opened in 1979 \\(the blood and hair of prisoners was still visible on the floor to these early visitors\\) and international visitors were the only ones allowed for around a year. In this time period John Pilger published his influential documentary 'Cambodia Year Zero' but while there are a few shots of a broken skull there were no piles of bones depicted. Similarly in 1984 'the killing fields' by Roland Joffe was released to much acclaim and the 'idea' of Cambodia and the devastation of the Khmer Rouge was solidified in the western consciousness, one scene depicts a vast waterlogged bone field. I don't have evidence for this but I would assume in the mid 1980s once the memorial stupa was erected in Cheoung Ek \\(the large column containing thousands of skulls behind glass\\) the image may have become more prominent. As this 'killing field' and the museum at S\\-21 are basically locked in for any tourist going to Cambodia it would make sense for the striking images and photos of skulls to be disseminated into the wider 'western image' of Cambodia from this point on. In the mid 90's when the UN transitional peace process occurred there was a wider interest in Cambodia again as it was seen as 'opening up' following the Cold War. Around this time Ben Kiernan publishes the 'Pol Pot Regime', the cover of which is just a photo of skulls excavated with blindfolds still attached. There is a long tradition of books on the subject employing this kind of imagery \\- and for good reason, it is a striking image from a sales point of view.\n\nAs for why the skulls are often arranged in this particular way? I am unaware if there is any cultural significance of the glass, or the arrangement of the skulls in this imposing manner. I have seen many photos of other mass graves excavations around the country and the skulls are often stacked or laid out, it may be a helpful way to account for the number of dead in any given killing site. As for the more 'elaborate' installations near the capital, Mai Lam had also worked on the Vietnam War atrocity museum where the idea is to really move an audience or visitor. I would presume that the arrangement of the skulls is done to primarily shock the viewer, both young and old Cambodians and maybe even more importantly the international visitor. It is actually a fairly alien custom to the Khmer, who are around 92 & #37; Theravada Buddhist, to not properly bury their dead or cremate them. It is thought the dead may not find peace if they are not properly buried. As I alluded to previously \\- these kinds of ossuary have two primary purposes: to shock and remind people of the Khmer Rouge period, and in doing so legitimise the government that toppled the callous regime responsible for these atrocities \\- and the second being one more traditionally associated with memorial.\n\nA more simple answer may be that people are fascinated with these kinds of morbid tourist attractions \\- I would guarantee that 4/5 people you know who have visited Cambodia have a photo with them next to one of the exhibits of skulls at S\\-21 or Cheoung Ek. At the National Gallery of Victoria a recent exhibit by Ron Mueck entitled \"MASS\" \\- gigantic white skulls spread throughout a room \\- is directly influenced by exhibits like those in Cambodia or Rwanda. For many, myself included, seeing the nightmare of the Khmer Rouge regime represented in fields of bones and skulls is an enduring and powerful image, it makes sense that it is so often associated in the western consciousness with Cambodia.\n\nA good secondary source to consult for this is David Chandler's \"Voices From S\\-21: Terror and History in Pol Pot's Secret Prison\", as well as articles like Madness and Mayhem: The Aesthetics of Dark Tourism by Collette Copeland."

                "(Part 1)\n\nIn the 1950s, there was a distinct divide between major and minor record labels in the USA. The minor record labels were often regionally-based, and because of their 'minor' status - that is, they were not particularly large - they did not always have consistent, national distribution of their records to record stores. In 2017, it's worth remembering that, in the 1950s, if you wanted to hear recorded music at a time of your choosing, you had to have access to spinning discs like 7\" vinyl records - there were no Spotify, no iPods, etc - on a record player or perhaps a jukebox. Someone needed to physically drive these 7\" records to record stores in places like Alabama, Oregon and Nevada for the song to have any chance in the national charts, and having a national network of people doing this distribution is therefore expensive, and much cheaper and easier if you have lots of records to regularly put in the shops that have a good chance of getting sold.\n\nMinor record labels often found themselves in shallow waters financially, because payments by distributors and royalty payments etc tended to lag - minor record labels often went out of business *because* they had a hit (and so they might, say, have overspent borrowed money on pressing 1.5 million copies, when it had only sold 1 million copies, because while there was still demand when decided to print more, the demand had died down by the time they were pressed and distributed). Which is to say that there was not much money in minor record labels in the 1950s, and plenty of shonky operators who would fleece artists in order to increase their share of the takings/keep the record company afloat while they waited for money to trickle back from the distributors (if it ever did) to pay their creditors with. As a result, it was very typical for rhythm  &  blues acts on minor record labels to be paid a small lump sum fee for their recording - $30, perhaps - and to not expect much more even if the song was a #1 hit on the R & B charts.\n\nIn contrast, there was more money to be made in the (somewhat more staid) world of major record labels. These labels did have consistent national distribution, because they were not specialty labels - a major label like Capitol or RCA in the 1950s in the US put out everything from jazz to pop to classical music to country music. Because these labels had deeper pockets, pressing plants of their own, and better communication with their distributors (typically, they were the distributors), they could much more easily keep up with demand for records. And because of their deeper pockets, they had much stronger, more consistent promotion of their artists, and could weather (for example) printing too many copies of a popular disc much more easily than a minor label. As a result, they were generally also much more conservative than the minor labels, and much less willing to take risks on a fad like rock  &  roll that would probably be over in a year or two.\n\nHere is a table of which rock and roll acts pre-The Beatles' 'Love Me Do' were on which labels, with the white acts in italics:\n\nArtist | Major Label | Minor Label\n---|---|----\n*Bill Haley  &  The Comets* | Decca | -\nFats Domino | - | Imperial\nLittle Richard | - | Specialty\nChuck Berry | - | Chess\n*Elvis Presley* | RCA (1956-) | Sun (1953-1956)\n*Buddy Holly/The Crickets* | Coral/Brunswick (subsidiaries of Decca) | -\n*The Everly Brothers* | Warner Bros (1960-) | Cadence (1955-1959)\n*Jerry Lee Lewis* | - | Sun Records (1956-) \n*Pat Boone* | - | Dot Records (1954-)\nThe Coasters/The Drifters | - | Atlantic Records\nRay Charles | ABC Records (1960-) | Atlantic Records (1952-1959)\nBo Diddley | - | Chess Records\n*Gene Vincent* | Capitol | -\n*Eddie Cochran* | - | Liberty\n*Johnny  &  Dorsey Burnette* | Coral | - \n*Carl Perkins* | Columbia (1958-) | Sun Records (1955-1958)\n\n. \n\nThat list should make it fairly clear that, generally, where the major record labels deigned to notice that rock  &  roll even existed - and there was a lot of pushback by the major labels against what they thought was little more than degenerate noise - the major labels were going to be signing nice white boys who were presumably, in their eyes, less dangerous and more marketable. It was therefore almost always the white rock  &  roll artists who had access to the superior moneymaking potential of major labels. And yes, there was absolutely an element of racism in this, whether it was the public's racism, the record executive's perceptions of the public's racism, or the record executive's racism. Remember that the rock  &  roll era occurred before the Civil Rights act, and that an Elvis Presley had a *much* easier time touring large swathes of America than a Chuck Berry did.\n\nIn terms of the more famous individual white rock  &  roll acts, the obvious one to start with is Elvis: \n\nElvis Presley spent much of his rock  &  roll years before he went into the army covering African-American artists. Unlike Pat Boone (who we'll get to later), Presley had a definite love for R & B music, and his Sun Records singles demonstrates Elvis's relatively obscure taste in R & B; ['Mystery Train'](_URL_7_) is a [Junior Parker cover](_URL_13_), ['Good Rockin' Tonight'](_URL_5_) is a [Roy Brown cover](_URL_9_), while ['That's All Right'](_URL_4_) is [an Arthur Crudup cover](_URL_2_) (all black artists). When Elvis moved to RCA, his two 1956 albums, *Elvis* and *Elvis Presley* are full of covers of black artists, from [Ray Charles' 'I Got A Woman'](_URL_8_), and a bunch of Little Richard songs - ['Tutti Frutti'](_URL_6_), 'Ready Teddy', and 'Long Tall Sally'. The 1956 single ['Hound Dog' was originally by Big Mama Thornton](_URL_1_), and a bunch of new songs were written for Elvis by the African-American songwriter Otis Blackwell such as 'All Shook Up', 'Don't Be Cruel' and 'Return To Sender'. \n\nPeter Guralnick's 1971 book *Feel Like Going Home* quotes Sam Phillips of Sun Records as saying \"If I could find a white man who had the Negro sound and the Negro feel, I could make a billion dollars\"; pre-Elvis, Sun Records had made a name for itself by recording Memphis blues musicians like B.B. King. In a footnote in Guralnick's study of Elvis, *Last Train To Memphis*, Guralnick confirms the accuracy of the quote, but also points out its irony; this was more Phillips frustrated that the great music he was recording wasn't getting its due than a man with dollar signs in his eyes. Nonetheless, once Phillips discovered that a shy young country singer called Elvis Presley was a fan of R & B music, he was in the right place and at the right time to exploit it.\n\nAnother ...interesting case on that list is Pat Boone. Boone was on a minor label, Dot Records, who were nonetheless a reasonably well-established light-entertainment-pop-focused minor label. Dot Records deliberately saw their college-boy crooner Pat Boone as someone who would have the clean cut white boy looks to get away with singing ['Ain't That A Shame'](_URL_12_) ([originally by Fats Domino](_URL_0_)) and ['Tutti Frutti'](_URL_14_) (again). Pat Boone famously hated the 'blunt and ungrammatical' approach of the rhythm  &  blues tunes he was covering, so he really was only singing previously popular R & B songs for the money/fame. And, judging by his (60 years later, almost comical) approach to 'Tutti Frutti', he clearly did not *get* the music. Nonetheless, Little Richard's 'Tutti Frutti' got to #17 on the Billboard charts, and Pat Boone's got to #11. Fats Domino's version of 'Ain't That A Shame' got to #10, and Pat Boone's got to #1. Little Richard has a few different versions of the same quote about his feelings on Pat Boone, including [one in the 1990s BBC series *Dancing In The Street*](_URL_10_); the 1984 one quoted by Wikipedia explains it just as well as any: \n\n >  \"They didn’t want me to be in the white guys' way. ... I felt I was pushed into a rhythm and blues corner to keep out of rockers' way, because that’s where the money is. When 'Tutti Frutti' came out. ... They needed a rock star to block me out of white homes because I was a hero to white kids. The white kids would have Pat Boone upon the dresser and me in the drawer 'cause they liked my version better, but the families didn't want me because of the image that I was projecting.\"\n\nOther white artists were less reliant on songs already made popular in R & B circles by black artists, however. The Everly Brothers relied heavily on the songwriting of husband and wife team Felice  &  Boudleaux Bryant, while Buddy Holly was a fine songwriter in his own right (whose [covers of 'Bo Diddley'](_URL_11_) by [Bo Diddley](_URL_3_) and 'Brown Eyed Handsome Man' by Chuck Berry were only released after his death).\n\nAll of which does pretty clearly show that simply being a handsome white boy certainly made it easier to a) get atop the charts singing the same tunes as the black guys but not as well, and b) get a major label record contract.

                "I know you've asked this question (or questions similar to it) several times now, and I've been waiting to answer in hopes that I might be proven wrong. But there's no evidence that I'm aware of for European or Muslim troops adopting each other's equipment during the Third Crusade; one expects that, if they were going to, they would have done so some time in the previous one hundred years, rather than during an active campaign. The only source I'm aware of that even describes individual equipment to any great extent is Baha al-Din, who emphasized the protective qualities of the Europeans' armor, consisting of both mail and some variety of felt vest that excelled at stopping arrows. I can't emphasize enough that most medieval sources are *terrible* for understanding the small details of military life. They are, in the main, concerned with narrative (and glorification of aristocratic sponsors). Tables of equipment, casualty reports, payrolls: we have none of these things for the Third Crusade.",
                "Probably not, no. \n\nEquipment in crusade warfare was based on the user's tactical approach to battle; these were fairly incompatible between the Christian and Muslim armies. \n\nIt is likely that Arab use of longer lances stemmed from their experiences fighting Franks: the equipment of the Crusader forces favoured close combat and so lances allowed for Arab fighters to engage from a greater distance. However, these were not Frankish lances, nor were they copies. These lances, especially those employed by the Turks, were much lighter. \n\nLikewise, the Muslim armies were equipped with shields but these were not the shields of the Franks. Arab shields were smaller (round, not 'kite-shaped') and also lighter. The theme of weight reduction should be becoming self-evident here: the tactical approach of the Muslim armies was overwhelming that of mobility. \n\nThe Frankish *milites* were increasingly armoured. Mail flowed increasingly over the extremities, into considerable skirts, over hands and into loops around the neck and face. A Muslim outfit not serve a Frank, nor would a Frank's equipment benefit an Muslim, because each is tailored very specifically to their respective culture's ideas on warfare.  \n\nWould weapons have been re-purposed on the battlefield? Logically we would yes, almost certainly. Do we have evidence that it was widespread or institutional? No. \n\nFor more information please consider *Crusading Warfare, 1097-1193* by **R.C. Smail**. "

                "As a follow up question, is this that abnormal for the time? Or has there been a pattern of taxless governance in the past?",
                "I suspect that the claim in the video you're referring to is based on a misunderstanding. Alexander didn't abolish all taxes. Wherever he went during his conquest of Asia, our sources report that he levied specific amounts of tribute or tax - usually at the same level as the Persians had done previously. For instance, when he replaced the satrap of Phrygia in Asia Minor:\n\n >  He made Kalas satrap of the satrapy which Arsites had held, ordering the inhabitants to pay the same taxes that they had previously paid to Dareios.\n\n-- Arrian, *Anabasis* 1.17.1\n\nShortly afterwards, an officer named Nikias is assigned to oversee \"the taxes, contributions and tribute\" levied from Lydia (Arr. *An.* 1.17.7). Clearly, the people were still expected to pay up.\n\nIndeed, it was Alexander's habit to pay the debts *and lift the tax obligations* on his own officers and soldiers (or to their surviving kin) as a reward for brave conduct in battle. On one occasion he abolished all taxes from a particular town because it claimed to be a colony of Argos, which was the home of Alexander's supposed ancestors (Arr. *An.* 2.5.9). Gestures like these obviously wouldn't make much sense if these people were not paying tax in the first place.\n\nSo what is causing the confusion? It is probably the fact that when Alexander first liberated the Greeks of Asia Minor, he freed them from the tribute that had been imposed by the Persians. This sounds an awful lot like he abolished taxes. However, he immediately replaced them with a fixed \"contribution\" which the Greek cities were to make to the common cause (i.e. waging war on the Persians). Their tax burden may have been lower, but it was certainly not abolished as a matter of principle.\n\nThat said, Alexander followed in his father's footsteps in cultivating an image of peerless generosity, which drove state expenses far beyond what any previous polity west of Persia could have sustained. His feasts and rounds of rewards for his troops could cost many thousands of talents each. On one occasion, Alexander spent about as much on a single celebration in Babylon as the entire silver reserve stockpiled by Athens for the Peloponnesian War. In addition, the sheer expense of maintaining a professional army - let alone one the size of Alexander's expeditionary force - would have been insurmountable to any Greek state. In short, Alexander needed stupendous amounts of money to sustain his conquests, and traditional means of gathering revenue weren't going to cut it.\n\nIt made sense for Alexander to avoid trying to make up the shortfall by raising additional tribute from the lands he took. Firstly, even if his revenue stream could be doubled or tripled, it would not have covered his costs. Secondly, the heavier the burden of tribute, the more likely it was that conquered regions would try to throw off his yoke. This would require larger garrisons, which in turn would drive up expenses. There was a major problem of diminishing returns in the notion of raising more taxes. Instead, the examples above suggest that Alexander generally kept tribute levels as they were, except in those cases (the Greeks of Asia Minor, the descendants of Argives, the fallen among his troops) where there was a clear propaganda coup to be made by abolishing them. But where else could he get the funds he needed?\n\nFor Alexander's father, the solution had been the conquest of the silver and gold mines at Amphipolis. This breakaway Athenian colony was adjacent to Macedon and fell under Philip's sway early in his reign; after expansion of its mines, its yearly revenue was said to be upwards of 1,000 talents (Diodoros 16.8.6) - as much as the tribute of the entire Athenian empire at the height of its power. For Philip, this bullion appears to have sufficed to build his professional army and establish his rule over Epiros, Thrace and mainland Greece. For Alexander, it would have provided a solid foundation for his finances. But at the scale at which Alexander operated, it was nowhere near enough money.\n\nAlexander's answer was simple: that which he could not provide for himself would have to be taken from others. Specifically, his campaign against the Persians largely succeeded in funding itself, through the \"liberation\" of staggering quantities of stockpiled Persian gold. When Alexander captured Sardis in Asia Minor, he seized 40,000 talents; in his campaign overall, including the spectacular plunder from the palace at Persepolis, we can calculate that he may have captured in the region of 250,000 talents of Persian gold. If Herodotos was right to estimate the total tribute of the Persian empire at c. 14,500 talents a year, Alexander released for his conquests a sum of money equal to 17 years of collected tribute from the largest empire in the world. This, and only this, allowed Alexander to be simultaneously as warlike and as generous as he was famed to be."

                "There is a pretty big divide both chronologically and stylistically between the Baroque and Classical periods. I'm going to speak to individual composers.\n\nBach was well known locally, he was a renowned organist and wrote hundreds of pieces of church music that would be heard often by people of all income levels. In addition, he was an influential teacher and led choirs. He was not known to the general public outside the areas where he lived until well after his death. His vocal music became popular in the 1830s. Bach's keyboard works were studied and played widely, but were rarely performed in public until further into the 19th century. \n\nHandel and Scarlatti were both international stars in composing circles, and were both contemporaries and rivals. They ended up working in the courts of England and Spain, respectively, and Handel especially composed many pieces that would be heard by the general public: fanfares/oratorios/music for festivals and holidays, etc.\n\nBefore Mozart, traveling performing musicians were viewed more like oddities or circus performers to the general public. We know that Mozart and his contemporaries were all stellar improvisors, and would have a repertoire of folk and pop (opera) tunes that they could play and improvise off of on command. This implies that in addition to performing for royalty they would have performed for middle class audiences. There have been debates among musicologists about *who* Mozart wrote his pieces for, upper classes or lower (or both). His music was incredibly accessible to everybody regardless of education level during his time period, yet he wrote with finesse and showed an understanding of theory and form that only musically inclined intellectuals would pick up on. I don't know the current status of this debate though.\n\nBeethoven wrote pieces based off of \"Gassenhauers\", the equivalent of hit singles. The last movement of his Op. 11 Piano Trio is a theme and variations on a song that was sung throughout the lower class and would have been familiar to them at least. He was also important because he was one of the first composers to work independently of a patron. Once Beethoven went deaf he made his living off of selling scores of his music and commissions from wealthy people, but reviews of his music in newspapers suggest that his large scale works would have been largely recognized by the public."

Patton would use \"Mongol\" to describe people that modern Americans would describe as \"Asian,\" similar to how he would use \"Negro\" when modern Americans would use \"black\" or \"African-American.\"  \n\n[Here's](_URL_0_) an example of how ethnicity was categorized in the 19th century when Patton was born.   So to answer your question, calling someone Mongolian or mongoloid  in 1945 means something similar to calling someone \"Asian\" today.  \n\nOf course, most people in 1945 would ascribe traits such as deviousness or inscrutability to someone described as \"mongoloid\" or Asian.  Patton does so in the passage you're referring to.\n\n > The difficulty in understanding the Russian is that we do not take cognizance of the fact that he is not a European but an Asiatic and therefore thinks deviously. We can no more understand a Russian than a Chinaman or a Japanese and, from what I have seen of them, I have no particular desire to understand them except to ascertain how much lead or iron it takes to kill them. In addition to his other amiable characteristics, the Russian has no regard for human life and is an all out son of a bitch, a barbarian, and a chronic drunk."

You want experts on periods _prior_ to the Cold War. \n\nIt is worth noting that pretty much all of the millenarians of the past — the people who believed the world was close to ending — believed it was going to be because of divine intervention, e.g. rapture or apocalypse or what have you. In such a situation a bug-out bag is probably not going to make the difference, or even be a good idea.

                "Not sure on the specifics of this particular application/design, but there are a few ways you could make that happen. Note that a boat sail doesn't go perfectly perpendicular to the air flow: the ropes and shape hold it at an angle.\n\nFirst of all, the air being caught by the chutes pours out of the sides. This pushes against the air from the other chutes and pushes them apart. This might be the only thing going on in some designs. \n\nAs far as design possibilities go, where the rope splits into multiple ropes that attach to the parachute in different places at the top, it can split into different lengths. The difference might not be much, but it's enough for the force of the air to tilt the parachute (it will stay full and the ropes will stay tight due to the forces). The parachute can also be made asymmetrically to let a bit more air out of one side, making the parachute push in the opposite direction and pushing the other parachutes away.\n\n It looked like the three deployed together, ~~so there may be some sort of weak attachment holding them together and facing correctly that pops off when they inflate.~~ **EDIT: after further research, this seems to be done with very careful rigging, not some breakaway device.** As far as stopping them from rotating to steer into each other, it's just a matter of making sure that the forces pushing them away are stronger and that the equilibrium point is 3 equally spaced parachutes 120 degrees from each other. In other words, you design them so that if one starts to drift out of place, it creates some airflow that pushes it back. This is mostly from the air pouring out of the sides of the other parachutes. Edit: _URL_1_ Note the ports in the side of the parachute. This is the only place for air to escape, other than bending around the bottom. As far as the air escaping from the bottom goes: _URL_0_ Note the jet of air pouring out of the downwind side here (thick red line). With the three parachutes angled as they are, this is pointed toward the middle.\n\n**Tl;dr: Parachutes deflect air toward each other, pushing apart. They may also be designed to be at an angle when pulled tight.**",
                "Once fully inflated, the air pressure contained by each of the parachutes give a certain structure/rigidity to each chute, keeping them from collapsing when they come together (the pressure inside of each parachute will be equal, so no one parachute is more rigid/hard than another). \n\nAs far as the angles are concerned, that is just physics. they are counterbalancing each other in such way that there is enough outward \"pull\" on each one so as to avoid coming to close. The angles on the strapping (connecting it/them to the capsule) are not forced into place by anything other than this counterbalance as far as I know (the engineers will have accounted for this based off of the weight of the payload vs. the braking force generated by each parachute).\n\nAnother design feature of these re-entry/ cargo type parachutes is the very long shroud lines. When compared, the shroud lines on a Army Paratroopers parachute are much shorter(relatively). The longer shroud lines allow the steeper angle with with multiple parachutes. (Imagine, for a moment, if they were superrr short, as a hyperbole. They wouldn't be able to face downward as much, more angled, as it were.) ",
                "_URL_0_\nbetter vid of the parachutes opening up.  \n\n\nno idea about the wind dynamics. \nthe vid shows two chutes are lauched together first. then they launch the third parachute. \n\nafter all three are at full length, the chutes  catch wind and ooen up to its max size.",
                "It depends on the parachute types. Those big parachutes that you see landing the capsules for Apollo, SpaceX, Orion, etc., have a certain angle that they want to be at. This is called a \"trim angle,\" which is the angle from the vertical. It's partly because there is so much fabric compared to open spaces, but air wants to dump out of the canopy. The slots and vent opening don't give enough open spaces, so the parachute tilts to the side. How much it tilts to the side is the trim angle. There are nice curves that show stability with regards to the angle.\n\nYou don't want to make the suspension lines different lengths. That would be silly. For one, it would be obnoxious to pack. And the loads on the lines would be wildly different, which would be awful to design for. Also you wouldn't/couldn't add some kind of spacer or whatever. Each main is packed into a separate bag in its own bay. How would you have some connecting piece that goes from main to main, all the way inside the bag?\n\nFor other parachutes, like the pilots that pull out the mains, or the drogues that provide the initial deceleration and stabilization, there is a higher ratio of open space to fabric. The capsule also goes a lot faster under these parachutes, so the trim angle isn't being sought as much.\n\nIf you're really curious, you should read [Knacke's Parachute Recovery Systems Design Manual](_URL_0_).\n\nSource: I design parachutes for a living.",
                "It happens naturally, you're absolutely right that there is an inclination for the parachutes to go to a position where the centre of mass is below them.\n\nBut there are also aerodynamic effects that result in the parachutes staying open and keeping separate because the air they don't 'capture' (for want of a better word) rush between the gaps and push them apart.\n\n[This paper on the aerodynamic of parachute clusters](_URL_0_) has some nice pictures that show the fluid dynamics between the parachutes (pg 971).\n\nThe reason for the separation is that the air that isn't 'captured' by the parachute cluster flows between the individual parachutes before doing complex things in the low pressure region on the upper sides of the canopies. The net affect is the individual parachutes stay apart.\n\nYou're absolutely right to think the parachutes should collapse to the middle with the centre of mass below them - but thats only considering from a statics pov.  \n\nThe aerodynamic affects of the air flow between the parachutes and into the low pressure regions above the canopies as well as the interaction of the vortices that result over come that 'statics problem'\n\n",
                "Actually they do crash into each other. Particularly after opening (or disreefing as referred to in parachute lingo) the parachutes fly out and then come back in and crash together. \n\nParachute contact is undesirable because 1) it adds to the risk of canopy deflation 2) the descent speed increases when the parachutes contact as the aerodynamic frontal area of the system is reduced. \n\nIn order to help the system stability you can see spacex and Apollo and even Orion have missing panels in the canopy. The holes slightly increase the descent rate but greatly increase stability. \n\nSource: Masters thesis on thr Orion parachute system. "

However the amount is negligable for ship movement perspective and only relevant to aiming.\n\nThere are a lot of answers on how much a battleship moves from full broadsides, but its generally agreed to be negligable if it moves lateraly at all. \n\nHere is a video of the [USS Missouri firing full broadsides](_URL_0_) At what looks to be 30 degrees. Since the ship is underway its a little difficult to tell but it seems that the motion of the water plays more of a role in the ships lateral movement and roll then firing the guns multiple times. "

                "Your body vomits when it senses various different threats. These threats can take the form of toxic chemicals or stress hormones in the blood, swaying motions, or an upset stomach. Chemicals and hormones are detected by the brain’s chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ), swaying motions are detected by the inner ear, while an upset stomach is identified by the vagus nerve. Once the signal for a need to vomit arrives at the CTZ, it sets off a chain reaction.\n\nIn the Brainstem - The chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) receives a stimulus that might warrant vomiting. The vomiting centre begins a choreographed sequence of actions.\n\nThe  Salivary glands -  Your mouth suddenly begins producing extra saliva. This is slightly alkaline and forms a buffer to protect your mouth and teeth from incoming stomach acid.\n\nThe Diaphragm - You take a deep breath to avoid getting vomit in your lungs, then the diaphragm contracts in a few short pulses, squeezing the stomach to create pressure.\n\nThe Glottis - The glottis closes, sealing the airway. Nothing enters or leaves the lungs. Diaphragm contractions without vomiting cause dry heaves.\n\nAbdominal muscles - The abdominal muscles contract to further increase pressure. The pyloric sphincter at the bottom of the stomach is held closed. The only way out is upwards.\n\nThe Skin - The sympathetic nervous system raises your heart rate and makes you sweat across your whole body, to shed the heat from this sudden exertion.\n\n & #x200B;\n\nsource : [_URL_0_](_URL_0_)",
                "For substances that are perceived as acutely toxic to the stomach, you will throw up immediately (e.g. syrup of ipecac will irritate the gastric mucosa). For substances that trigger the CTZ (described in another post), they will induce vomiting a little bit later because the substance needs to enter the bloodstream first and cross the blood brain barrier.\n\nFor the remainder of \"things that make you sick,\" - which is largely limited to infections - they will often produce a 'toxin' of sorts (e.g. C. diff) which only is released once the substance makes its way into the small bowel/colon (remember, food doesn't sit in your stomach for very long. Very little absorption happens there). Bacteria that aren't killed off by the stomach acid will multiply rapidly in your GI tract. So by the time the bacteria/virus/toxins start to cause their damage, they are well in their way into the small bowels. You can't purge your bowels north, so you purge them south.",
                "Commenting for the diarrhea bit:\n\nDiahrrea is when your body throws up out your butt. This is why it's mostly water. If your body detects an irritant or some other pathogen it will signal to have your body fill your intestines with water, flushing out whatevers inside. This is why diahrrea causes dehydration. Your body uses a large quantity of water to flush your guts out, so it doesnt have time to be absorbed by your intestines.",
                "u/jiggity_gee had the best ELI5 answer for this\n\nSo your bowels are like a long train track and your food is like a set of cars on the track. Transit time between Point A, your mouth, and Point B, the chute, is a bit flexible but normally operates on a regularly scheduled basis.\n\nWhen you eat, you put cars on the track and send them to Point B. As these cars go to Point B, they lose passengers (nutrients) at various points in the thin tunnel portion (small intestine). The journey isnt complete and the journey has already altered the shape of the car pretty significantly giving a rusty color. Once in the larger portion of the tunnel, the cars are checked for stray passengers and are hosed down a bit so that transition out of Point B isn't so bad. Sometimes, the train cars park juuust outside the gates of Point B so they can exit at the best time for the operator (toilet).\n\nNow, all of this goes fucking nuts when you load a bad set of train cars at Point A. The track sensors located everywhere along the track, detect this alien set of cars and sends a distress call to the Supervisor (your brain). The Supervisor wants to handle the situation without having to phone the Manager (your consciousness) about the craziness on the tracks and also wants to make sure you never know it was on the tracks. It has to make a choice now: send it back to Point A violently and somewhat painfully risking tearing the tracks, or send it to Point B as fast as fuck? Depending on where it's located on the track, it'll choose the best route.\n\nLet's use the destination Point B. The Supervisor hits the panic button and puts all the train cars that are on the track (in your body) on overdrive. The tunnels are flooded with water and lubricant to speed all the cars up and get them the hell out of there as quickly as possible. Cars collide with each other, and previously well formed cars are just flooded with water and lubricant that they are just a soggy, shadowy reminder of their former glory state.\n\nThe Media (pain) hears about the car collisions immediately begins filming live the high speed, flooded train cars out of control. They want to knos how an alien set of train cars were put on the tracks and they want someone to pay for such carelessness. The Manager is just watching the horror unfold on Live TV but cannot do anything to stop it, because the Supervisor was deaf and he had not installed a means of communicating with him after hours in the office.\n\nI hope this answers your question.\n\nTL;DR when you get diarrhea, everything gets pushed out, one way or another. There are no passing lanes.\n\nSource: medical student"

Get into a Canadian bar?  Fake a Texas driver's license.\n\nID checkers *should* have a book somewhere accessible that shows samples of legitimate IDs from around the world.

                "Creating a fake passport good enough to pass scrutiny at a major western airport would range from extremely difficult to impossible, especially with the introduction of passports containing RFID chips and computers to verify the information on them. So if someone wants to travel under a false identity the most likely thing to do would be to use a stolen passport. It's far easier (though by no means easy) to alter the details in a genuine, stolen passport, than to create a new one from scratch.\n\nThis is one reason why pickpockets and thieves target foreign tourists -- a stolen US or EU passport can be sold for a considerable sum of money on the black market. Quite apart from its use as a fake identity for criminals, it can also be used by would-be illegal immigrants to try to enter a country legitimately."

                "Because meldonium medically has been shown to improve the exercise capacity of injured tissues (for example, injured tissues in the heart in heart attacks), it has been used without any approval for increasing exercise capacity of noninjured tissues (like muscles and a healthy heart). One of the major issues with meldonium is that it's quite unknown. Many of the claims of its performance enhancement are largely untested, but rather used anecdotally and to \"keep up\"  with other athletics trends trends and dopers. \n\nThe mechanism of action would be likely of one of modifying a number of metabolic pathways, some understood (like the one you suggested), and others not well understood.   Our metabolisms are very complex, and many effects have multiple inputs and modifiers. \n\nThe simplistic answer is that it seems to reduce oxidative stress on tissues. \n\nEdit: digging a little deeper into the original research on this compound is kinda weird because it is mostly eastern block stuff.  But I did find this:\n\n_URL_0_",
                "[Meldonium](_URL_2_) is an anti-ischemic drug, which means it increases blood flow to tissues. It has been shown to increase endurance performance in patients with angina, which is a condition brought on by poor blood flow. Increasing blood flow can have a performance enhancing effect for a healthy athlete, which is why meldonium ended up banned starting January 1st 2016 after being on the monitored list, [source](_URL_1_). It is classified as a metabolic modulator on the WADA [Prohibited List](_URL_0_).",
                "According to the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), meldonium acts as a \"metabolic modulator.\"  It improves sports performance by stopping the carnitine activities and stops the mitochondria from being overloaded by fatty acid breakdown during exercise and instead shifts the focus towards breaking down carbohydrates, which requires less oxygen to be taken away from muscles.  By reducing the pressure on the mitochondria, meldonium reduces the amount of urea and lactate in the blood and allows for improved oxygen transport to the muscles to aid not only in performance but in recovery.\n\nSource: _URL_0_",
                "Not to disrespect any of the good answers in this thread, but just to address a broader point, many of these associations are far too heavy handed when it comes to drugs of any kind as a rule. \n\nLook at Ross Rebagliati. He was stripped of his medal when they found traces of marijuana in his blood. Marijuana is clearly not a performance enhancing drug, it's just a drug. But nonetheless it was a banned substance for athletes. There are lots of similar examples, so I don't know if there actually needs to be a sensible justification for the classification in the eyes of many sports associations. ",
                "Additionally: a Russian speedskater and shorttracker have allegedly been caught as well. One is a world record holder and the other a world champion.\n \nApparantly they did so while combatting a heart condition. Impressive.",
                "• Meldonium is used to treat ischaemia: a lack of blood flow to parts of the body, particularly in cases of angina or heart failure.\n\n• It is manufactured in Latvia and only distributed in Baltic countries and Russia. It is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in the United States and is not authorised in the rest of Europe.\n\n• It increases blood flow, which improves exercise capacity in athletes.\n\n• Wada found “evidence of its use by athletes with the intention of enhancing performance” by virtue of carrying more oxygen to muscle tissue.\n\n• The decision to add meldonium to the banned list was approved on 16 September 2015, and it came into effect on 1 January 2016. Wada had spent the previous year monitoring the drug before adding it to the banned list.\n\n• The drug was name-checked in the latest investigative documentary on Russian doping reforms by the German Hajo Seppelt on Sunday. The documentary referred to a 2015 study in which 17% of Russian athletes (724 of 4,316) tested were found to have meldonium in their system. A global study found 2.2% of athletes had it in their system.\n\n• L’Equipe reported that the scientific advisor to the French Agency Against Doping (AFLD), Professor Xavier Bigard, said in interviews with athletes at last year’s European Games in Baku that a wide proportion of athletes admitted taking meldonium.\n\n• It is classed as an S4 substance under the Wada code, which addresses hormone and metabolic modulators.\n\n• The standard ban under the World Anti-Doping Code is four years.\n\n• A memo was sent out to athletes by Russia’s anti-doping agency last September informing them of the decision to ban its use.\n\n• Sharapova says she has been taking the drug for 10 years after she was regularly falling ill. She had a magnesium deficiency and family history of diabetes.\n\n• Several athletes have been suspended since the turn of 2016 after testing positive for the dug. Abebe Aregawi, the 2013 women’s 1,500m world champion, has been provisionally suspended after meldonium was found in an A sample she provided. Endeshaw Negesse, the 2015 Tokyo marathon champion, was also banned after reportedly testing positive for the same substance. Others include Olga Abramova and Artem Tyschcenko, two Ukrainian biathletes, Eduard Vorganov, a Russian cyclist and Ekaterina Bobrova, a Russian ice dancer.\n",
                "Maria Sharapova was apparently taking this for years, and it wasn't banned. Suddenly it's now banned, and her sponsors are either suspending her, or dropping her entirely. Wouldn't it be fair to give her a set amount of time (whatever a doctor recommends) to get off the drug? After all, it was legal until just now. If she suddenly just stopped taking it, this might be very detrimental to her health. It's not like she was taking a substance for years that was actually banned for all those years. ",
                "The real question is, when does something cross the line to become 'performance enhancing?'  From water, to caffeine, to broccoli, to creatine, to steroids.  Everything \"enhances performance\" so to speak.   It gets kind of silly after a while.  What's next? A ban on sugar?",
                "Possibly a naïve question, but could it be the case that she was taking meldonium prior to the January 1 ban and it would still appear positive in testing now?\n\nI only ask because I know some banned/monitored substances can show up months after stopping use.  For example, I'll stopped taking creatine several months before my recent blood test, but my liver results still showed elevated creatinine levels.\n\nEdit: spelling",
                "Given what Maria says about her medical condition (magnesium deficiency and diabetes...etc). What medication would she have been prescribed if she were a regular but active (not obese, not sedentary) person who went to the doctor? Would these medications have been better than meldonium save for the FDA approval?",
                "In a lot simpler terms than the top comment, melodonium basically allows for increased physical endurance through greater blood flow (aka muscles get more blood). Lots of Kenyan runners have been linked to it. It actually wasn't banned in the sport of tennis till this year, so not sure why Sharapova kept taking it.",
                "A lot of people seem to have already explained up how the drug helps performance. Some of you might still be wondering: why won't blocking fatty acid transport into the mitochondria for energy use HAMPER an athlete's performance?\"  \n  \nWell it's simple. Muscles mostly use fatty acids as energy only during rest, so really only at a very basal level. Almost ALL the energy they use for contraction comes from ATP, creatine phosphate, glycogen, and blood glucose.  \n  \nSource: I'm in medical school and had to learn that about a month ago.",
                "If you can follow the below. Basically Meldonium prevents Carnitine production. If you cant form Carnitine you'll have more of the amino acids lysine.

                "Rutherford was influenced by Prout's hypothesis that all atoms were made up of groups of hydrogen atoms, with the hydrogen atom being the fundamental particle. The logic was that the atomic weights known at the time were almost exactly integer multiples of the mass of hydrogen. If there were smaller particles, there would be smaller elements or elements with masses that fell in between multiples of hydrogen. Obviously Rutherford discovered that an atom wasn't just one particle but a positive nucleus surrounded by negative electrons, and then when he observed the process of nitrogen atoms releasing hydrogen atoms when bombarded by alpha particles he took this as evidence that the hydrogen nucleus is indeed the fundamental building block for all other nuclei. This was before the neutron was discovered, it was believed that the nucleus was only made of positive charges.\n\nOf course, protons are actually made up of quarks with fractional charges but there was no way to know that at the time.",

                "Let me preface this by saying that I’m just an undergrad studying nutrition and biochemistry so I am by no means an expert.\n\nThere are three key factors in the breakdown of food in the body:\n\n1. Chemical composition of the food (lipids, carbs, and protein)\n2. Regulatory hormones in the digestive system and;\n3. The thermic effect of food (TEF). \n\nAll are critically important to answering this question. The calorie model is good for the everyday eater because it is extremely simple, calories in = calories out; to maintain weight. There are of course derivations you can think of for losing or gaining weight. This works because calories are simply a measure of heat, so what is really being stated is energy in = energy lost as heat. However, the reality is not so clear cut. \n\nThe calorie system was initially created by literally burning macromolecules to see how much heat is released. It was found that carbohydrates (starches and sugars) released 4Kcal/g, lipids (saturated and unsaturated fats) released 9Kcal/g and protein (amino acids) released 4Kcal/g. It was from this that the calorie system we have today arose. Now, due to the TEF not all macromolecules are equal in the energy required to distribute them throughout the body. Lipids are already close to being in the form that the body likes to store them in, so they take very little energy to break them down (estimates 5-8 Kcal released per 100Kcal lipid) however, proteins and carbohydrates must be broken down into fatty acids which requires a great deal of enzyme activity before they can be stored as fat. For this reason, protein is rarely used in the body to store as fat if the body can avoid it, estimates of 25-35Kcal lost as heat per 100Kcal protein; carbohydrates are somewhere in-between. For this reason, all food is not broken down in the body in the same fashion, and is a reason why some vegetables actually have negative caloric value.\n\nNow, as per your example, consider a cake, let’s break it down into its component parts. 2100 calories in a cake, let’s say 40% is fat (whipped cream, butter, frosting) 55% is carbohydrates (flour, sugar, whipped cream, frosting) and 5% is protein (egg, milk). Desserts and sweets like this are a gold mine for the body, they see this enormous amount of fat and it looks great. The body is specifically programmed to eat as much fat as possible, as it is relatively scarce and is calorically dense. No matter if you eat this all at once, or in small portions, the % comp will remain the same. Therefore, the body is going to go after the fat and store it in fat cells. However, the key to this problem is the question of which method will store more fat as triglycerides in the adipose cells? \n\n**Let me stop here and say the following is speculation from what I’ve learned in school, I’d love for someone in the know to correct me if I’m wrong. \n\nWhen you eat the entire cake all at once, the body cannot physically digest the entire thing, a slew of enzymes are released from inception starting with salivary amylase and salivary lipase in the mouth to pepsin in the stomach. When the cake reaches the stomach (if the body doesn’t tell the sympathetic nervous system to throw up) it will mostly stay in the stomach while HCL and peristalsis do their thing to break down the food as much as possible, meanwhile, the stomach will push the cake through the small intestine in as quick as fashion as possible. Here, the small intestine, pancreas, gallbladder, and liver go into overdrive sending digestive enzymes to break down the food enough to be absorbed by the cell walls and into the blood and lymph systems.  Meanwhile, the CNS sends out “rest and digest” signals to the whole body including the pancreas which starts to make plenty of insulin for the bloodstream. These signals also attempt to slow down other normal activity in the body, in the hope that the body can more quickly digest this massive energy source. From here until the cake is digested, the body will attempt to store all of the fatty acids and carbohydrates as fat in the fat cells, the insulin levels will stay high until the cake is nearly out of the intestine. \n\n\nOn the other hand, when you eat only 1 piece of cake, the insulin levels will not stay as high for as long, which will make your body less lethargic allowing you to stay at an increased metabolic rate and using more calories overall. \n\n\nTL;DR Eating a whole cake causes more adipose tissue production thus leading to higher amount/ larger fat cells. \n"

                "Well, depending on your definition of 'worshiping the sun', some still do.\n\nFor example, in Hinduism, the god Surya is the sun god and is an important deity in traditional Hindu astrology.  He is worshiped as the supreme deity by the Saura sect (_URL_1_) of Hindus - tough admittedly they're a smaller sect than other major Hindu sects.  The Smrata Hindu tradition (_URL_2_) also worships Surya as one of its five principle deities, along with Shiva, Vishnu, Devi, and Ganesha.\n\nIn Japanese Shinto, the sun goddess Amaterasu is an important goddess, considered the ancestor of the Yamato clan, and thus the ancestor of all the Japanese emperors.  Ise Jingu shrine (_URL_0_) is arguably the most important Japanese shrine, and is dedicated to this sun goddess.  Worship at this shrine has been a key part of Shinto for hundreds of years.\n\nOther major religions (Christianity, Judaism, Islam etc.) don't worship the sun because it's considered to be a part of God's creation, rather than God himself.  This began with the Torah, as in Genesis 1:14, God famously creates the sun and moon (called 'lights in the firmament of heaven' in the text).",
                "If I may ask another question (if not I might put it as a seperate thread): Why *did* the ancient Egyptians worship the sun to such an extent? It seems that every Egyptian deity who was considered head of the pantheon in any region or time took on aspects of a sun god.\n\nI mean, I can understand that Egyptians would worship the Nile (as they did), because it gives the country life. But sunshine/warmth is a thing of which there always was an abundance in Egypt. Why would you worship a thing of which there is so much that it actually becomes a danger (draughts, fire, heatstroke, etc.) I could get it if say the German tribes in the freezing north worshipped the sun, but why somebody who no doubt would have been better off with a bit less sun?"

                "There's enough material in this question for a good-sized thesis. I have attempted to distill it down into a few paragraphs. I've found several books I now need to buy in the process, which is always good. :)\n\nThe 15th and 16th Centuries featured slow, gradual change in agriculture in Europe. People who worked on the land were differentiated by wealth much more at the end of the 16th century than they were at the beginning of the 15th, mostly due to consolidation of farming land, but you'd be hard put to point at a particular year or even decade and say that things changed then. Agricultural output increased, but this was in large part due to new land - forest or fen cut back, and in the Netherlands, land reclaimed from the sea. There's also some claim that there was an increased tempo of change toward the end of the period, possibly even constituing a sort of mini-agricultural revolution from 1560 onward, although I'm not completely convinced. \n\nThe following is generalised almost to the point of uselessness, to be honest, but here goes anyway. A 50-acre farm would have been a fairly comfortably sized one - with the average yield-seed ratios of the era (which are absolutely awful by modern standards, hovering around 4:1), 20 acres, mostly under grain, was just about enough to sustain a family of 5 (and in most areas, these are the smallest farms for which records exist). In a good year, on good soil, that could rise as far as 8:1, but more likely 6:1. And in a bad year, well, you were lucky to get your seed back. There were several periods where a few bad years came together - the mid 1540s and the late 1590s were very notable for this, and localised famines were the immediate result. Inefficient markets and slow transport meant that importing food from unaffected areas wasn't really possible. Toward the end of the 15th century, though, market movements were improving, and particularly in England, wool was a good cash option, so there's a movement then from arable to pasture land.\n\nThe ideal on 50 acres would probably have been to have a mixed farm; a good area under grain, assorted livestock and a variety of other crops. However, geography can militate against this - if you have good, fertile loam, you're not going to turn it into pasture grazing land (although you might have meadows for hay), and if you have thin, scrubby soil over shale hills, you can't do anything *but* turn it into grazing lands. Forest, marsh, coastal areas, and the presence or absence of rivers also have lots of effects - while water can be diverted (and very often was, with millraces and all manner of artificial streams) to get it to animals, it can't be made to run uphill - no pumps. So if you were grazing sheep on dry-ish hills, they needed to be herded down to water every day, probably a couple of times. Forest gives you firewood, and also foraging for pigs, but is otherwise land you can't put to other uses, and through most of northern Europe in these periods, could be home to wolves and bears^(1).\n\nHowever, mixing it up as much as you could gave you a bit of bulwark against the famine years. Assuming an ability to do that: barley, oats, wheat and legumes were grown on almost any farm. Rye was less frequent in the southern end of Europe, and more so in the northern end. Maslin, a period practice of growing different grains all mixed up in one field also happened (and that makes it quite hard to estimate yields). Onions, carrots and other roots, as well as brassicas, were the domain of kitchen gardens rather than full fields. \n\nThe fact that farms could be mixed didn't mean they were, though. Campbell and Overton (in the sources, below), point to a few farms in Norfolk that were 80% or more under barley for long periods - which can't have been great for the soil. And the other 20% would arguably have been fodderage and pasture for the horses (which were replacing oxen in all but the least progressive areas by the 14th century) necessary for ploughing for and transporting all that barley. \n\nIn terms of livestock, partly due to the cash value of wool, sheep moved from being a peasant stock to being a demesne stock - that is, they were kept directly by the owners of the bigger estates, rather than being owned by the peasants with wool passed on in rent. Pigs were everywhere - not in huge numbers, but everywhere. Cattle were more used for dairy than meat, but because of that, were nearly a necessity on any large farm - you need milk and butter and cheese. And chickens were probably pretty frequent too - capons (castrated roosters) on bigger farms, but mostly just everywhere and underfoot. They're not much accounted for in farming records, but they're there in recipes and other accounts. And in addition to the chickens, you have dovecotes, the introduction of rabbits to England around the 13th century as meat animals, semi-wild deer, and a wide assortment of other things. \n\nSo to give a vague conclusion before this gets completely out of hand, yes, late medieval/early modern farms were usually pretty mixed, but *could* be specialised. Specialisation probably happened more in otherwise wealthy areas like Norfolk, because people there weren't living on so much of a knife-edge of potential famine.\n\n**Sources:**\n\nSteve Hindle, 'Rural Society' in Beat Kumin, *The European World 1500-1800*, 2009.\n\nGrenville G.

There've been no bears in Ireland for 10,000 years, and wolves were never really a major concern up until they were hunted to extinction. So apart from mentioning they were there, I've no idea how much of a threat, socially or in reality, they really were. In either case, they were vastly, vastly more of a threat to livestock than people."

                " >  I squeeze the trigger which provides this energy for the bullet.\n\nHere's your problem.  Pulling the trigger isn't what provides the energy to the bullet.  The energy for the bullet comes from the explosive powder stored in the cartridge.  When this explosive is set off, the bullet flies forward.  \n\nThink of a gun's trigger like the gas pedal on your car.  The energy to make the car go forward doesn't come from your foot on the pedal.  It comes from the gasoline.  Your foot on the pedal just regulates the flow of gasoline into the engine.",
                "In most guns, pulling the trigger does not provide the energy to fire the bullet. When you load the first round in most guns except revolvers, the process of manipulating the action (the slide in handguns) compresses a spring.\n\nIn revolvers, pulling the hammer back will compress that spring. Some revolvers can also do this with a much heavier trigger pull.\n\nBy pulling the trigger, it releases the spring, which pushes a firing pin into the primer of the cartridge. (In a gun with a hammer, the spring pushes either the hammer directly into the primer or into a firing pin.) The primer explodes, igniting the gunpowder and propelling the bullet.\n\nIn automatic or semi-automatic guns, the explosion also cycles the action, loads the next round in and compressed the spring. Automatics will then let the spring decompress, repeating the firing process as long as the trigger is depressed. Semi-automatic guns require you to release the trigger and pull it again to fire the next round.",

The bullet goes bang, pushes back on the bolt (part that holds the bullet in place) bolt goes backward from recoil.  That motion is cocking the hammer back and loading the next bullet, and ejecting the casing of the just-fired bullet. \n\nSome more modern semi-auto and full-auto guns use some of the pressurized gas (same gas that is sending the bullet down the barrel) to drive the bolt backward.

When you squeeze the trigger it ignites the gun powder which propels the bullet forward. Think about how much energy is imparted with the flick of your finger. Not nearly enough to send a bullet off at faster than the speed of sound.\n\nWith automatic weapons, some of that energy being released is captured to effectively \"pull the trigger\" on the next round.",

                "It may be easier to clue you into what's happening by considering one rifle, fired in two separate ways.\n\nConsider the M16 military rifle. For the purposes of this answer, we will consider semi-automatic and automatic modes only.\n\nIn semi-automatic fire, pulling the trigger moves a part called the [*disconnector,*](_URL_3_) moving a small tab on the disconnector away from a notch on the [*hammer.*](_URL_1_) The hammer, under spring tension, flies up and strikes the *firing pin,* setting off the round. The force of the expanding gas drives the working parts of the rifle (the BCG, or [*bolt carrier group*](_URL_0_)) backward, forcing the hammer down. On its way down, it catches on that hook on the top of the disconnector, stopping it from firing again without releasing the trigger and pulling it again.\n\nIn full-auto mode, rotating the selector switch pushes the disconnector down so that the hook no longer catches the hammer. This time, a tab of metal called an *auto sear* sits behind the hammer. When the trigger is pulled, the hammer flies up and the BCG is forced backward, instead of being caught by the hook, the auto sear tips forward, catching part of the hammer. *But,* when the rear end of the BCG hits the auto sear, it knocks it off of the hammer. Under spring tension, the hammer flies forward again.\n\n[This video shows you in graphic form what I've described above.](_URL_2_)\n",
                "There are multiple systems where a portion of the gas or kinetic energy from the burning powder or expanding cartridge gets cycled back into the action. Here are a few examples:\n\nGas Direct Impingement: AR15\n\n* Hot gas made by the burning powder pushes the bullet out. There's a hole in the barrel that vents out a tiny bit of this gas and cycles it back to the gun. At the end of the bolt (the thing that locks to hold the cartridge) is a small cup that gets pushed, acting like a piston and causing the gun to unlock and cycle. This system puts dirty hot gas back into the gun.\n\nIndirect Gas/ Piston: AK47\n\n* Starting the same way as above, the gas pushes the bullet out, some of it is vented from a hole in the barrel into a chamber that has a piston. The gas pushes the piston, which is connected to the bolt. Causing it to unlock and cycle. This system vents the dirty hot gas outside of the gun, making the insides of the gun slightly cleaner.\n\nBlowback: Pistols, some submachine guns. \n\n* This system works by using the cartridge as a piston. When the gun is fired, the bullet works like a seal in the barrel. The hot gasses are pushing forward and back. When the bullet is towards exit, the pressure spikes the highest and pushes back on the cartridge too. The cartridge pushes against the action cause it to unlock and cycle the next round. ",
                "\"No such thing as a stupid question,\" my old teacher would say.  And then he would turn to the rest of the class and say \"Does anybody else have a stupid question?\"\n\nWhen you shoot a bullet in a simple handgun, what happens is that pulling the trigger releases the spring-loaded hammer which hits a firing pin, which ignites the primer, which ignites the powder, which propels the bullet out the barrel towards something you hopefully wanted dead.  On a single action revolver, you have to manually pull the hammer back again which also rotates the cylinder to bring the next bullet into position (in some very rare old guns you have to manually rotate the cylinder as well).  On a double action revolver, you can do that or you can just pull the trigger which will pull the hammer back and rotate the cylinder for you, but this is a harder and longer pull and may affect your aim and rate of fire.  For advanced users, hold down the trigger and slap at the hammer (also called \"fanning\"), quickly pulling it back and rotating the cylinder, and since the trigger is already pulled the hammer falls back and fires the bullet as quickly as possible.\n\nFor an automatic gun, the gun uses the recoil of firing the bullet or the expanding gases to do the \"bring the next bullet into position and pull back the hammer\" part.  Essentially, the machine gun does the fanning part for you.  Powered by the bullets themselves, it will keep firing until you run out of ammo or the barrel gets too hot, which is actually a problem in combat situations.  In WWII, the British would fire unnecessary rounds to heat up their guns so they could heat water for tea.\n\nIt's worth noting that in larger machine guns, those with multiple barrels, they have outside sources of power to rotate said barrels into position.  Early gatling guns had manual cranks.  Newer ones have electrical motors and have a spin up and spin down time during which they can't be fired.  My favorite machine gun is the [General Electric GAU-8/A Avenger](_URL_0_) which also has an A-10 Thunderbolt II \"Warthog\" airplane built around it.",
                "You provide energy to move the hammer for the first bullet. All other bullets are using the energy of the previous bullets discharge to reset the hammer and since you are holing the trigger down it does not lock in a cocked position and instead strikes the next bullet. ",
                "From the gunpowder. \n\nAutomatics are generally either recoil operated or gas operated, but the energy all comes from the gunpowder.",
                " >  I mean, if I think of a simple handgun, I squeeze the trigger which provides this energy for the bullet. But in automatic machine guns there is no such source, right?\n\nActually there is. \n\nThe shiny part you can see in [this image](_URL_0_) (showing the inner working of a SG-550 (standard military weapon in Switzerland) is the hammer. When you load a bullet into the chamber the hammer is automatically cocked and when you pull the trigger you release it. \n\nThe hammer then hits a sort of bolt (I don't know the exact English terms) and this bolt is then rammed into the primer of the cartridge. The primer explodes and ignites the \"larger\" load of \"gunpowder\" which expands abruptly and pushes the bullet out of the rifle. \n\nDuring the firing process part of the energy created is used to reload and during the reload process the hammer gets cocked again. \n\nThe only difference between automatic fire and semi-automatic fire is that the hammer isn't immediately released again after being cocked. \n\nSqueezing the trigger doesn't provide the energy for the bullet. It only sets of the process that will fire the bullet. "

                "Not an answer but blue is the shortest wavelength and therefore the highest energy of the visible spectrum. And higher energy is harder all around to deal with. For example, 7,000 kelvin light bulbs emit a lot of blue spectrum and many people find them to be burning and fatiguing of their vision. Another example is radio engineering, where higher frequencies are orders of magnitude more difficult to design and have increasingly erratic behavior. So it is built in to the wavelength/frequency of the light wave and the amount of energy required to generate it.",
                "Blue LEDs came along after red, yellow and green, but today white LEDs use a blue LED plus phosphors to make red and green. So production of blue LEDs is commonplace if not exactly \"easy\". \n\nDeep blue fireworks are difficult because the burning copper compounds don't emit only blue. They emit blackbody radiation as well because of their heat. That makes for a less saturated blue. The temperature is critical. Too hot means more washed out. Too cool means less blue to start with. A similar effect happens when things are heated to incandescence. At first you see deep red, then orange, yellow, and white. The red doesn't go away as other wavelengths are added. You don't see an overall green or blue hue even though both wavelengths are present in a white hot object.\n\nIs blue paint or dye difficult to make? I know blue is less common in nature than red, yellow, or brown, but green is also uncommon in animals. Many bright green snakes and frogs are actually blue and yellow. The blue comes from interference, the yellow from pigment. When they die, they sometimes turn blue as the yellow pigment fades away. ",
                "It all comes down to energy. \n\nFor emission, blue light has the highest energy, so to emit it you need to have two states that are pretty far apart in energy that are set up for electrons to transition efficiently between them. Generally, the wider the energy gap between two states, the higher the chance there are other states in between (due to defects, etc.) that electrons would more efficiently hop to (usually non-radiatively), thus quenching the emission.\n\nFor pigments, the problem is the opposite. To appear blue you need to absorb red and green. This requires have a very low-energy transition that red light can excite *without* having a higher-energy one that blue light can. This can be a challenge too, since many extended materials that absorb red and green light (like Si in solar cells) also absorb blue to some extent and just end up looking black. \n\nThree of the main ways to achieve this are to use a transition metal ion with a d-d transition in the red (usually Cu or Co), to use a near-IR absorption that tails into the visible, or to use an extended molecular structure to narrow the gap between ground and excited states. The first approach is how most ancient blue pigments like [Cobalt Blue](_URL_1_) and [Azurite](_URL_2_). The second mechanism is how [Prussian Blue](_URL_5_), [Ultramarine](_URL_3_), and [molybdenum blues](_URL_0_) work - a very easy  (read: low-energy) \"intervalence charge transfer\" where an electron hops between to atoms of the same element in different oxidation states. The last is a more modern approach, where extended pi-conjugated molecules like [copper phthalocyanine](_URL_6_) or [indigo](_URL_4_) are used; many of these organic molecules tend to be less stable to oxygen and UV light."

        "selftext": "My name is Ken Kosik. I’m a neuroscientist and neurologist at University of California, Santa Barbara. I'm fascinated by nearly every facet of Alzheimer’s disease and other cognitive disorders. I tend to think about the nervous system in terms of genetics and cellular and molecular biology, but also find the clinical questions compelling. AMA!\n \nThe incidence of Alzheimer’s disease is spiraling upward. By age 85 the likelihood of getting the disease approaches 50%, a grim reward for the octogenarian. Few diseases are as simultaneously cruel and mysterious as Alzheimer’s for its ability to obliterate a lifetime of memories and destroy histories even as it robs the person of his or her capacity to function in the present. And because we use memory to envision the future, Alzheimer’s disease also takes away expectations, anticipation, and hope.\n \nNearly 25 years ago, on a trip to Colombia, Dr. Francisco Lopera introduced me a family he had been tracking for the previous decade. We began a collaboration to find the cause of their early onset dementia, which turned out to be Alzheimer’s disease, and to identify the mutation responsible for the autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. The mutation turned out to be the substitution of glutamic acid for an alanine at position 280 of the presenilin I gene. The large extended family that harbors this mutation consists of about 5000 people whose lineage can be traced to a single founder, probably a conquistador who came from Spain not long after Christopher Columbus. Those family members who harbor the mutation are genetically determined to get a particularly aggressive early onset form of Alzheimer’s disease with the first symptoms apparent by age 45. The hallmark amyloid begins to collect in the brain about a decade earlier. Recently, this large Colombian family has begun to participate in a clinical trial that is testing an antibody directed at amyloid in the hope that the drug can reduce the amyloid burden and retard disease progression.\n \nThis story and others related to Alzheimer clinical trials is the subject of a NOVA PBS documentary titled “Can Alzheimer’s Be Stopped?” produced by Sarah Holt. I hope you will be able to watch it on the evening of April 13 at 9/8c on PBS: _URL_0_\n\nBy the way, this is AMA so please feel free to ask me about my other research interests, which include brain evolution and a research project on how the earliest cells during human development become neurons.\n\nThanks again for all your questions. I will continue to answer questions when I can this week, so stay tuned.",

Indeed, over 95% of *all* AD clincial trials have failed.\n\nThis trend (and other observations, such as the observation that even healthy individuals have Aβ oligomers) has prompted researcher to propose new hypotheses about the patho-etiology of AD. Of these, one hypothesis suggests that dysfunctional Presenilin (the gene which is mutated in these Colombian families) may be the key driver of AD.\n\nHow do you feel about this hypothesis?

It was a difficult decline, to say the least, causing health declines for us caregivers as well. I have two questions:\n\n1) Each of them ended up with different extreme behavioral issues - one with unmanageable OCD and anxiety, one with wild paranoid hallucinations and panic attacks, and one with frontal lobe dysfunction causing hypersexuality and a total lack of inhibition. Does Alzheimer's affect each person's brain differently, causing damage to different parts that cause such different behaviors? Or did each of them have these latent tendencies already, with Alzheimer's being the catalyst that brought them out?\n\n2) Is there quality research going on regarding the health declines of caregivers, and ways to mitigate and treat this? I've seen sleep deprivation, potentially stress-induced high cholesterol and blood pressure, severe depression, and cognitive decline in their spouses. Support groups help some with the tears, but trying to get medical help (and insurance coverage for it!) is difficult, as many primary care doctors and insurance companies don't seem to see caregiver burnout as a comprehensive medical condition.",

From what I know now, all of those were normal readings.  \n \nLast week we had to take her to the ER because of an irregular heart beat. This happened directly after a physical therapy session. The ER wanted to admit her and potentially put in a pacemaker but due to her illness and her DNR we opted to do a follow up appointment instead.

The Lipizzaners and other baroque breeds are also [trained in even more traditional moves](_URL_0_), which include jumping so as to get above/on top of foot soldiers, rearing up on their hind legs and striking out with their front, or jumping and kicking out their back legs. Horses are extremely trainable animals and love to please handlers whom they have grown to respect; it's presumably possible that an intelligent horse person could have trained their war horse to do any number of offensive moves while on the battlefield, though some were more standard than others. \n\nHaving been a horse person for decades, I feel compelled to include the disclaimer that horses are not by nature aggressive animals (quite the opposite). The only horses I have ever met that are truly aggressive towards humans by their own volition (and not while being asked to do that by a handler/rider) have been abused by humans in their past or are currently in a lot of pain (i.e. suffering from ulcers). Some ponies (horses under 14.2 hands tall, a hand is 4 inches) and some mares (unspayed female horses) may have an attitude that appears as aggressiveness to a non-horse person. They are, however, big prey animals and can be startled easily if not handled appropriately (and sometimes even if they are) or view behavior as a threat which often leads to being kicked or pushed over and injured unintentionally. They exist on a fight or flight plane -- loud noises, sudden movements, anything perceived as a threat or possible predator must be escaped. If it cannot be run from, they will fight it.",
                "Could a horse disembowel a man? Maybe, but I doubt it. Horses don't have the right tools to remove a man's intestines or to cut him open. A horse's teeth just aren't set up for that kind of thing (being herbivores and all). And while a kick from a horse can kill you, your intestines will likely stay within your body.\n\nI've found little evidence or reason to suggest that horses were trained to kick or attack at will on the battle field. In fact, that would be a really undesirable trait for a warhorse. It would make the horse absolutely impossible to handle. There's no way around that one- if the horse is trained to attack people and other horses, it will attack people and other horses, and it won't differentiate between its handlers and its enemies, especially in a combat scenario. It would not behove a knight to have his prize horse constantly attempt to kill the squire tasked with leading it to the battlefield, nor would it be good to allow the horse to attack men randomly. Knights, by and large, wanted horses that were obedient. \n\nIn his 1853 book, \"The Horse,\" William Youatt says that, \"the after-usefulness of the animal is founded, is early attachment to and confidence in man, and obedience, resulting principally from these\" (99).\n\nI've seen the claim that horses would bite and kick in combat in a fair amount of secondary and tertiary sources, but I'm yet to find a primary source that describes this actually happening. If it did happen, I'd imagine that it was probably unintentional and not something that the knight would train into his mounts. Because again, it would make handling the horse and stabling the horse an absolute nightmare (pardon a pun). If the knights were to charge, they would be doing so in a group. Why would the knights want their horses attacking other horses in their formation? Because that's what would happen.\n\nHere is a 17th century painting of Polish warhorses.\n\n_URL_0_\n\nNotice how they are in a tight formation, not attacking each other. This is the more typical warhorse.\n\nAnd beyond that... a horse's teeth aren't going to break armor. If a horse rears to strike, that puts the knight at a huge disadvantage because suddenly, all of his weight gets thrown back and he can't reach with his sword or lance. It exposes the horse's legs and stomach, which wouldn't have been armored, and on bad footing, it sets the horse up for a fall. If the horse kicks with its hind legs, that means the knight is facing away from the threat, which again, puts him at a disadvantage because he can't turn in his armor well while in the saddle, and he can't use his weapons. If his back is to the enemy, he would either be turning or running. Additionally, cavalry serve to break infantry lines and harass the enemy. The advantage of the horse is that they are mobile. If the horse is kicking, rearing, or biting, the horse is no longer mobile- it's stationary. And if the horse isn't moving, it's a much easier target to hit.\n\nAnyway. So I don't believe in the whole \"war horses would kick and bite!\" myth. I just can't find sources that prove it, and I can't find any logic that would make it make any sort of sense.\n\nHorses are inherently dangerous, but not so dangerous that they are unable to be handled safely. Horses were ultimately a way of getting a weapon to the battlefield, and they had to be obedient enough to do so reliably. And there is no horse training in history that would allow for a horse to bite a man on it's on volition. That has universally been considered a vice that needs correcting.\n\nIf that groom was killed, he probably did something he shouldn't have done around the horse.",
                "You may find interesting [this medical journal entry from 1896](_URL_0_) describing injuries from horse-kicks. \"No class of traumata produce such a variety of injuries and in such varying degrees as a kick of a horse upon the abdomen.\"",
                "On a related note, one of the most famous statistical distributions, the Poisson distribution, was popularized through a statistician's effort to estimate the total deaths by horse-kick in the Prussian army. So it was obviously a significant enough problem to warrant a large statistical study looking into it."

In a lot of ways the marketing techniques used with the (economically) lower and middle classes simply don't work with the upper class. To improve sales they develop a relationship with their potential customers, offer options for their vehicles based on the needs that their clients express to them, and make appearances (both with their representatives and their vehicles) at events that are more likely to have their clientele in the first place.

It might be that whatever causes Parkinson's *also* causes the damage to dopamine receptors. \n\nAlso, depression is linked to serotonin and norepinephrine, not dopamine. If anything, there'd be a lack of *motivation*, not depression. ",
                "There are 3 main pathways for dopamine in the brain. The nigrostriatal path is responsible for movement and that's the part that is compromised most with Parkinson's. You also have the mesolimbic, which is the \"reward\" center pathway, and mesocortical, which is more involved with emotional modulation. People with Parkinson's have degeneration of the cells that manufacture dopamine, so all of these pathways can potentially be affected, but for some reason the movement is most compromised.",

Researchers hypothesize that the effect of Parkinson's on this system is responsible for the clinical symptoms of depression and anxiety.\n\n[Source](_URL_0_)\n\nFor those living with Parkinson's, and family  &  friends, do stop over at /r/Parkinsons.

                "There seems to be a little confusion/questioning about what you're left with after the water step, fibrinogen or albumin so I looked up the blood contents\n\nConveniently there is this image at wikipedia, which is pretty fascinating:\n\n_URL_0_\n\nAll the way to the right you can see the things present in the grams per litre range\n\n    Albumin 40-50 g/L\n    Globulins 25-35 g/L\n    Fibrinogen 2-2.5 g/L\n    Transferin 2-3 g/L\n\nInterestingly these are all \"big\" things in that they are all proteins with fairly high molecular masses. Just about everything else in your blood ( <  1 g/L) is a small molecule. There are some exceptions (proteins with names ending in '-in') but they are vanishingly rare and not worth considering here.\n\nSo what happens with your mildly gruesome process/experiment? The blood in your bottle cap will undergo 2 processes that \"dry\" it off, some of the water will evaporate off and the prothrombin/thrombin will get on with coagulating your blood.\n\nThrombin converts the fibrinogen (soluble) in your blood to fibrin (insoluble). The fibrin can bond to itself and will form a loose sticky mesh. This mesh forms the main structural matrix of a blood clot or scab. Embedded in this meshed will be any large items in your blood; blood cells (red  &  white) and proteins.\n\nWhite blood cells and most proteins are pretty rare so the mesh will mostly contain red blood cells, albumin, globulin and transferrin.\n\nYour next step is to move the coagulated disc to water. It is not completely clear to me what happens at this step. Certainly all the haemoglobin (the red stuff) leeches out of the disc and back in to the water due to the osmotic gradient. There seems to me to be two processes this could happen.\n\nFirst, the fibrin mesh is sufficiently loose so the red blood cells just dissolve back to the water. Red blood cells are pretty big, if this is the case then you'd also expect all other trapped water soluble elements (proteins, small molecules) to also return to the water. This means your remaining slimy material is almost certainly just the remaining Fibrin mesh with nothing else\n\nAlternatively the water you've added may lyse (break open) the red blood cells, due to the osmotic pressure. In this case the haemoglobin will dissolve back in to the water but leave the detritus of the red blood cells trapped in the fribin matrix. Albumin and haemoglobulin are all around the same molecular weight (approx 60KDa), so if the haemoglobulin can dissolve back to the water then so can most of the other blood proteins. In this case the slimy material left is the fibrin mesh with the remains of the red blood cells trapped in it. Globulins can range up to 1000s of KDa so perhaps they might remain trapped in the mesh too.\n\nEdit: As pointed out below overnight drying may just rupture all the redblood cells. I don't know whether the fibrin network will trap enough water to prevent this. So perhaps the latter outcome is most likely"

                "Bones usually have 2 main fascial compartments around them. A flexor and extensor, and some have a medial compartment too. There is no real need for a strong dorsiflexion action in the lower leg (bending your foot upwards), the muscles are used mainly for stabilization and so there are no large muscle groups there. Compare that to the other side of the leg where a strong plantarflexion (pushing your foot donwards) action is needed for walking and you have the huge calf muscles.\n\nedit: mixed up extensor and flexor in the leg again",
                "Other answers address why there is less muscle mass on the anterior side of the leg, but don't answer the question of why the tibia is exposed.  I don't think k there is a really good answer... Probably coincidence as much as anything, but consider this:\n\nThe arm and leg are actually built very similarly, and the forearm has two bones (ulna  & amp; radius) just like the leg does (tibia  & amp; fibula).  The ulna is the arm-version of the tibia, and if you feel your own arm, you can trace the unprotected bone all the way from the elbow to the wrist just below the pinky finger.  In my opinion, the only difference between the ulna and tibia is that the tibia has to bear all your body weight, so it is a much larger bone, and thus your shin is a lot more prominent than your exposed ulna.\n\nTo answer your second question: why do we have no protection from bumping our shins?:\n\nThe tibia IS the protection.  Bone protects soft tissue from injury, ie. the skull protects the brain, sternum and ribs protect heart, vertebrae protect the spinal cord.\n\nEdit: I don't really think the point of the tibia is protection.  It is there to support the body and anchor muscles  &  ligaments.  Just saying that while many muscles 'cushion' bones from impact, that's not really their purpose, and you wouldn't grow a muscle on the front of your shin just to keep from bumping it.\n",
                "If comparing the amount of tissue on the anterior portion of the tibia, then any benefit of additional tissue to protect the shin from damage would be outweighed by the detriment of increasing mass in the legs resulting in decreased running speed, manoeuvrability, and endurance.\n\nIf comparing the position of the tibia relative to the centre of the leg (keeping the mass of tissue the same but changing the anterior-posterior location of the tibia), then having a more anteriorly located tibia would allow a greater lever action from the calf muscles to lift the body during [toe-off](_URL_0_) of the gait cycle.\n\nOverall the driving force to protect the shin would be outweighed by the driving force to run faster and for longer (think minor injuries when it is impacted which can heal vs. ability to outrun predator or prey). So evolution optimized for the most anteriorly positioned tibia that had just enough tissue on the anterior side to still allow sufficient enough blood flow.",
                "The muscles don't really serve as bone protectors. Muscles are for motility. This fact is demostrated by the many bones in your body that have no mucle between them and the skin. Skull, sternum, vertebrae etc. Even the back side of your ulna has nothing between it and the skin just like the tibia in the same respective area."

A cat on a branch that won't come down just doesn't feel like coming down and would like you to bugger off to let him do his own thing for a while.\n\nEdit: Well, ok, I guess I'm thinking of full grown, outdoor cats. Really young cats, or cats who have been indoors their entire lives, can get a little creeped out, actually. They get too high up and get scared. They'll figure it out eventually if you give them a chance, though.",
                "You can, and you can't. On the one hand, it will probably figure out how to get down again, and be fine, depending on how smart/old/agile it is. On the other hand, it might take a while which means it'll be crying in the tree for a while, which gets annoying at the very least. Depending on the weather, you may not be able to let said cat just figure things out. You also run the risk of it jumping or falling from too high of a height, which could lead to injury.\n\nMy recommendation is to stay with it for a bit, see if it can figure out how to come down - but if it's not making progress, if it's cold out, or if it looks like the cat wants to try jumping, etc, give the cat a hand.

Almost all animals have a very strong desire to do everything moving head first. That is why a cat doesn't climb down the same way they climbed up. My best guess is that when the cat gets thirsty enough it will try and jump down. Might be successful, might not.",
                "  The saying is one never sees cat skeletons in trees so they will eventually risk coming down on their own, still it reminds me of an event that did amaze me.\n\n Near 30 years ago, I rented a 2nd floor apartment with a large tree outside the window. Came home from work, it was starting to rain and I heard a cat crying in the tree. I climbed it a short distance but the silly cat then climbed higher The rain was getting worse so I said 'FU, cat' and went upstairs. A friend cane by with some good weed so we got stoned and watched the lightning. It turned into a pretty nasty storm, waves of rain. and the cat was howling in full view from the window- but beyond reach.\n\n Perhaps God lent a hand, hard to say, but a bolt NAILED that tree. It was now dark out but in that flash I saw the cat blown clear. As my friend hollered 'Praise the Lord' (the thunder was deafening/ rocked the house) I witnessed it tumbling through the air. Cat was nowhere to be found, so it apparently survived.",
                "So we had some stupid cat get stuck in a big pine tree we have in the back yard. Probably climbed the tree to get away from our two dogs. On the first day, we figured we'd leave it overnight and it would find a way down. By the end of the second day it hadn't moved and was up there crying.\n\nEventually, I was able to use a tennis ball tied to a string to run a line over a branch above the cat. Had to use a tennis racquet to hit the ball high enough because the stupid cat was like 30 feet up. I then tied a basket onto the line with a can of tuna in there. Once I got it close enough, the smell of the tuna must have really worked 'cause the cat jumped right into the basket and I lowered it down to safety.\n\nSo, to answer the question, I think they can get stuck in trees. Especially with dogs patrolling the bottom of said tree.",
                "Why can't you just get a hose?",
                "We had a cat that treed itself for more than 4 weeks in January and February in NY.  It was too stupid to climb down, and every time we tried to put a ladder up to get it down it got scared and climbed higher.  It went through snow and ice storms and still stayed in the tree.  Every time we called a vet to see what we should do they said, \"don't worry, it'll come down.  Try luring it down with food\".  So my mom hung cans of tuna in the tree and grilled steak under the tree for the whole month, but she wouldn't come down.  She was about 40 feet up by the end of it in a very thin tree.  Because of the location on the property we couldn't get a cherry picker up there either, so after more than a month we cut the tree down.  As we were lowering it, the fucker jumped out of the tree still 30 feet off the ground and ran away for 2 days.  When she finally came home she was just skin and bones and was never the same again.",

                "This past summer, our cat went missing. He'd been gone overnight before, so we weren't worried.  After two days we put up signs and started to get calls about a lot of cats that weren't ours. After five days we started to give up hope. By chance, a guy outside of our neighborhood did see a sign after a week. Our cat had been stuck in his tree for 6 days.  It was up about 40 feet.  We ended finding a local guy who is a (professional?) tree climber.  He went up and after 30 minutes, was able to grab him, stuff him in our provided pillow case and lower him down by rope.  Here's a photo that the guy took right before he got him: _URL_0_\n\nI'm not sure he was every going to come down.  It was in the 90s that week and he had gone 6 days without water except for one night of rain. ",
                "I had a cat be stuck in a huge, huge tree for about four days when I was a kid of around 7. My dad told me not to worry because \"You don't find cat skeletons in trees\" and I said, \"That's because the wind knocks them down\". To this day I am still pretty sure my theory works over his.",
                "Cat's claws are curved in such a way that they work for climbing up but not for going down, so they basically have no traction going down. If they're not too high up, they'll just jump down, but if they're very high up, they may be facing a dead-if-you-do, dead-if-you-don't situation.\n\nWhen I was a teen, a neighbor's cat got stuck about 100 feet up a very tall tree. The next day, the fire department showed up and got it down. A few months later, it happened again. Each day when I went outside, I heard the cat meowing for help. On the third day, I asked, and they said the fire department refused to come again.\n\nI went home, put on some tight gloves and a jacket. I got a belt and tied it around the bottom of the jacket. I carefully climbed the tree. When I got to the level of the cat, he immediately came over to me and clung to me. I put him in my jacket and zipped it up. He was very calm, seemingly relieved.\n\nThe little boy who lived there had come out to watch. When I got down, I handed him the cat. From that day forward, every time he saw me, he would say, \"You saved my cat!\" or something similar. I never imagined it would mean so much to him, nor the way it would make me feel every time he said that. I just wanted to help the cat.",
                "Wow, not a single inside-cat owner explaining this?  \n\nBasically, once your inside cat makes it outdoors, you're slightly terrified that you'll lose them permanently.  Cats don't always return home like dogs tend to do - you have a spooked inside-only kitty outside and you may well never see it again.\n\nIf they spook and run up a tree, well... the issue is in trying to get them down NOW so you can control the recapture, or at least continue following it until it calms and can be retrieved to the house.  \n\nYou certainly could leave it to get bored/tired/hungry and figure out how to make it down, but then you're effectively abandoning your cat.  Odds of ever seeing it again go way down.  \n\nThis whole concept only really applies to indoor cats that are pretty unfamiliar with outside/trees.  Outdoor or hybrid in/out cats are pretty comfortable in an arboreal state.",
                "Cats can survive falling at their terminal velocity (the highest speed they will reach when falling), this is why they can and do jump out of many story buildings and survive.  \n\nThough like anyone else jumping from heights it's not really a smart move as there are a lot of ways they can seriously injure themselves.  \n\nCats will usually get desperate and jump if they have to.  But they do the distressed wailing first because they know you'll try and help them and it's usually much easier to help than to pay vet bills for broken bones.  "

                "A good question. Though I have no credible sources, I would imagine its as simple as this:\nUSA, Russia, and China all have small pox locked away for a few reasons. First, though no current humans knowingly have it, the virus could be hiding or laying dormant elsewhere. Animals such as bats and vermin are known carriers for some pretty scary stuff like ebolai. So its technically possible for the disease to make a come back. \n\nSecondly, if any of us were at war with each other, the temptation to use it as a weapon is going to be pretty high. Sure, the Geneva Convention outlawed biological warfare,  but in an all out third world war, nothing will be off the table. We keep the virus so in case they try to infect our population, we can create vaccines to counter it. \n\nThere may be some more points such as medical applications of altering the diseases,  but the above reasons are my speculation as to why we still have them. ",
                "ELI5 answer: we can never be 100% sure that someone else has not kept a deadly virus in a lab. Therefore the risk of it being used as a weapon in the future will always exist, even though it might be small. So it makes sense for us to keep a version of the virus to use in case we need to engineer a treatment in the future. ",
                "they are kept in case some country or terrorist group has an unregistered secret culture (a viable or dormant preserved form of the disease) that they may use for biological warfare. If, say, smallpox was released to the public in a terrorist act, everyone born after the 1970s when they stopped vaccinating would be susceptible to the disease. The idea behind keeping cultures of these diseases is to allow the quick and workable design of a new vaccine for a hyper-mutated weaponised strain in the event of attack, to eliminate loss of life. However the debate behind keeping these cultures is rife and the potential risks may outweigh the benefit. Basically, they should probably just cook the cultures and be done with it but we can't be sure that someone isn't harbouring the disease in some secret place.",
                "This was [discussed on NPR](_URL_0_) on Friday, specifically about smallpox, which is the only disease to have been completely wiped off the planet except for lab samples. For smallpox, there is an actual debate about destroying it completely instead of risking it being released again in the future.\n\nI'm pretty sure the rest of them pop up here and there, even if they're mostly eliminated. So it's worth keeping them around to study.",
                "A lot of them are kept as an index to compare generic structure of new outbreaks to old ones as well as to identify specific strains. ",
                "A lot of people have answered the first question, for your second question: It's not a movie. Breaking a vile on the ground isn't going to release a massive wave of disease wind into a conveniently open air duct leading to it spreading throughout the building. These are super secure buildings, with well trained staff, made specifically for housing these bugs and preventing the spread outside of its walls. ",
                "Eliminated doesn't mean no longer exists.\n\nFor example, they recently found smallpox scabs in an envelop that dated to the Civil War, which contained the active virus.  Keeping the virus around allows scientists to because to combat it should an outbreak occur.\n\nAdd to the fact that multiple countries are doing this, and some countries might choose to use it was a weapon, there is a value in keeping it around."

                "Its more a case of how safely newer cars can run on the edge of knock. Unlike older cars, your new car has an amazing computer that can read all sorts of sensors to determine how to run with the ~87 octane you're putting in it. \n\nFirst off its important to know what octane is. In the past it was a measure of certain molecules in the fuel, now its a measurement of how resistant a fuel is to ignition in light of heat and pressure. Low octane is thus less stable than high octane. It will ignite easier and less predictably.\n\nNext knock, its mostly referred to iginition in the cylinder at a bad time. Hot spots, pressure and heat can cause the ignition of fuel/air mixtures at really bad times, like when a cylinder (piston, oops!) is traveling up! This is nasty slam which can cause tons of damage over time to ring lands, bearings, etc. Also note that ignition is not instantaneous. It takes time and deals with the flame front from the spark to the piston head. So what you want to shoot for is igintion at spark with the flame front meeting the piston head at the downstoke. Preferrable when the connecting rod is at an angle where the vector of force is such that more force goes to rotating the crank than hammering the bearing.\n\nSo the name of the game is controlled ignition! \n\nKnock sensors detect when ignition goes bad and can retard timing to ensure future ignition at certain loads/rpm occur nicely. Intake temperature sensor can alter timing as well when it gets too hot outside. MAF / MAP sensors work in turbo cars to alter timing based on pressure added to the cylinders. \n\nIn short your new car is a robot with tons of sensors, algorithms and data tables that help it determine how to best run low octane fuel safely.\n\nEDIT: I have modified many turbo cars, helped reverse engineer automotive ROMs using IDA and have written my own software to edit ROM tables, log data, etc. My own last car was a turbo STi running 24 psi on 93 octane, and more PSI when I turned my meth injection kit on. \n\nEDIT #2: This is a snapshot of timing data a car would use. _URL_0_\n\nEDIT #3: When talking about timing values, you're talking about degrees of crank/rod angle before TDC (top dead center, or totally vertical connecting rod) Since ignition takes time, you spark before TDC and hope to god the flame front hits the piston head on the down stroke, after TDC.\n\nEDIT #4: Another thing to consider is fuel economy and AFR (air fuel ratio). There is a AFR point 14.7:1 *stoich* thats the optimum ratio for perfect combustion. The problem is that this makes for very unstable conditions in a high compression engine as leaner ratios can create very hot combustion. Against this is set of bad pollutants created at this lean ratio. All taken together its best to run at 12.5:1 to even better, low 13s:1. Once again, until recently with new materials and great car computers like those in the Impala, this just wasn't an option and you would have to run richer to cool the cylinder while wasting fuel.",
                "Many factors are involved in controlling \"ping\" or better described as pre ignition. \n\nOne of which is materials being used in the construction of the cylinder head/heads and block casting. A general rule of thumb, at least in the small block chevy world, is that aluminum heads will allow you to run 1 compression higher while all other variables are the same. Not always the case, but it explains the point superficially.\n\nAnother is cooling. A lot of work goes into the plumbing of the engine. Take for example the older chevy small block engines. The coolant system was fairly simple, but because of the way it was setup different parts of the engine would run at different temperatures because the coolant would get progressively warmer. Hotter parts cylinders will detonate faster. \n\nThen of course there is all of the computer controls which very finely calibrate how much fuel to add to help control/cool the cylinders.\n\nOthers will chime in with more specific things. But in general every little thing will play a role which adds up. Like quench, cam profile, cylinder ring gap, oil, etc.",
                "Also probably benefit of direct injection systems.  It injects the gas into the cylinder at the last possible moment, allowing the engine to better prevent pre-ignition knock\n\nSource\n_URL_0_",
                "To begin with, many of the other comments are highly relevant, but a better understanding of \"knock\" will fully answer your question. Knock occurs in any gasoline engine when ignition occurs before TDC and the combustion pressure front hits the piston combustion chamber face at a crank angle in which the vast majority of the load does not do useful work on the crank but simply overloads the wrist pin and crank bearings. The premature ignition timing creates much higher combustion chamber pressures and resonances that destroy valves, erode cylinders, heads and pistons, and break rings. The cause is simple and key to your answer: something in that chamber causes a spark (incorrect spark plug timing, burning/sparking components or intake charge), or gets hot enough to cause spontaneous combustion. To elaborate: A intake charge of fuel and air can be pre pressurized and heated by a turbo and then after being compressed be beyond autoignition temperature. Or a exhaust valve could be made of a material which retains heat (glowing hot) and the local mixture can therefore ignite due to contact (think simple physics, conduction, convection, and radiation).\nModern engines have active fuel management (computerized) that stops potential preignition mixtures during high load conditions (something a carb would not do) and also hot intake conditions (this is designed into the fuel map), they also employ sensors that detect knock and adjust intake mixtures accordingly (richen to decrease combustion chamber temperature).\nNow with that being said, high compression ratio engines have been built in the past that worked great. For example: the fireball combustion chamber has been run at up to 14:1:\n_URL_1_ \nand here: \n_URL_0_\n\nAs has been pointed out it is modern fuel management and spark timing, as well as better design of the cooling system within the block and head (thank computer aided design) and last but not least modern material choices that have allowed less expensive engine designs to running higher combustion chamber pressures and thus achieve higher efficiency. \n\nNote: All of this is simplified for the sake of a short response.\n\nSource: I have designed and manufactured heavy fuel, and spark ignition engines for prototype and production.\n",
                "tugi is correct in that combustion knock (ping etc...) is premature autoigntion of the fuel. There have been significant advances that have enabled regular (IMO low octane) fuels to be more widely utilized. The knock sensor alglorathim is part of that, but just as important are advance to the combustion chamber, scavenging, direct injection, in-cylinder fluid dynamics and EGR (exhaust gas recirculation).\n\nTechnically what you are noting as as knock is end gas knock, which is premature ignition of the peripheral charge late in the cycle. end gas knock is a function of time and temperature (and to some degree pressure).  This is commonly modeled with the livingwood-wu integral or [similar methods](_URL_0_). Temperature is primarily a function of compression ratio, however it is also a function of composition (ratio of specific hearts of the working fluid), initial temperature at intake valve close, and to some degree the combustion rate. \n\nWith a direct injected engine the fuel evaporates inside the cylinder, cooling the charge. This effectively increases the knock tolerance of the engine, as it decreases the final compressed charge temperature prior to spark and combustion. Moreover if the combustion chamber has good turbulence then the combustion rate increases decreasing the time that the end gas has to wait till the flame arrives. These two factors decreases the time temperature history and thereby reduce knocking propensity. \n\nAdditionally cooled EGR can be used to reduce the effects of compression heating (charge temperature prior to spark) by changing the specific heat of the charge (EGR has a high specific heat reducing charge heating and combustion temperatures).\n\nIn all likelihood the engine you drove does a bit of all of these. which are all aimed at increase fuel economy and power in a smaller displacement engine.\n\n\nEDIT! I can guarantee that GM or any other OEM has optimized the combustion rate and performance of a \"normal engine\" that is intended for 87AKI gasoline where the engine is not overly limited by knock at typical driving conditions, that would affect the vehicles ability to meet  corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) requirements. ",
                "Motorcycles can have mechanical compression ratios much higher (13:1 is common,) and still run on 87. With motorcycles, it's important to understand that the mechanical compression ratio is different than the effective compression ratio. The effective compression ratio is a combination of the mechanical ratio and the volumetric efficiency of the engine.\n\nAn engine spinning at 10,000RPM doesn't do a great job of filling the cylinders completely, so it has a relatively low Volumetric Efficiency. Because of this, the cylinder doesn't quite fill up completely, so the actual pressure in the cylinder isn't as high as you might expect.\n\nVolumetric Efficiency describes how well the engine is capable of filling the cylinders. A VE of 1.0 is considered very good. Some naturally aspirated engines can do better than 1.0, by taking advantage of the inertia of air to ram air into the cylinder. Turbo-charging is a technique that permits VE to go well above 1."

                "Have you ever watched *Game of Thrones*, or better yet, read the ASOIAF books? One thing that has always stuck out to me is the way Martin crafts a very strong family-centric identity and motivational pattern for the noble women characters. Obviously the motives of actual people are infinitely more complex and diverse than fictional characters. \n\nBut we might think of the picture he creates of Cat and Cersei in particular as *normative* or prescriptive for the late Middle Ages. That \"Family First\" mindset is our frame of reference for understanding the lives and duties of new patrician and noble mothers.\n\n\"First\" would first mean the new mother taking care of herself. For England, Barbara Harris describes a three-stage \"lying-in\" period that was expected (though again, actual practices would vary by case). First, the mother was *literally* lying, in her bed; after a period of two weeks or so, she was considered healed enough to sit upright; after another stretch of time, she could walk around but still only in the birthing/lying-in chamber. (Which she had prepared in advance to be special and awesome.) \n\nAll of this gave her body time to recover from the trauma of childbirth before resuming her regular household and court duties. And most particularly, before she was in the presence of men--especially her husband--again. (Incidentally, this is one reason that the \"wet nurses so she could get pregnant again ASAP\" thesis is just an excuse, NOT the whole story.)\n\nIdeally, the newborn would be removed from the mother almost immediately and given over to the care of nurses. The point was not at all to break the emotional ties between mother and child--in fact, mothers and fathers alike were expected to be intimately emotionally involved with their children. In Jewish families (stepping away from \"nobility or gentry\" for a moment), for example, mothers could not participate in the circumcision ceremony for their newborn sons but provided a special clean diaper cloth for the ceremony.\n\nInstead, the point was that any random woman could change a baby's diaper, any nursing woman could breastfeed an infant. Only the infant's mother could resume her duties at court and/or running the family and household, as swiftly as possible, thus doing far more to secure their long-term good fortune than dangling a rattle over a rocking cradle once a day.\n\nOnce women had returned to full participation in church and household, their Family First mentality pushed an expansion of their previous duties. Whether at court or traveling to visit family members and important acquaintances, mothers were to seek our potential marriage partners and wardship situations even while their offspring were toddlers. \n\nLater on in their children's lives, Christian mothers are often attributed with or charged with taking control of securing their children an education--in the high Middle Ages, some queen mothers are even credited with teaching their princeling sons to read--but for sure, didactic literature expects mothers to teach their children Christian morality by example and in the basics of Christian devotion (the standard prayers, the Ten Commandments,  & c).\n\nNow, it's important to remember yet again that this whole picture is normative. There is some evidence, especially from Germany, that suggests more flexibility for new mothers in how much attention they paid to day-to-day details of infant care. A very, *very* popular devotional practice in 14C-15C was what Rosemary Hale calls *imitatio Mariae*: imitation of Mary.\n\nThis meant envisioning yourself swaddling Jesus in his swaddling clothes, laying him in a manger, laying him in bed, decorating his swaddling clothes, breastfeeding him. Some women even had dedicated Christ-child dolls to LARP with, assuming \"LARP\" was a meditative practice that was, at its heart, a prayer. The devotion was documented and encouraged through \"Vitae Christi\" books, lives of Christ, that were enormously popular with religious women, especially in Germany.\n\nThe point is obviously not that aristocratic women role-played nursing Christ, so they were familiar with nursing their own/each others' infants. Rather, it shows how medieval people understood that the daily tasks of motherhood created an exuberant *emotional* bond between people and their rec center ( & c). \n\nIn some cases (Birgitta of Sweden, Katharina Tucher) we even witness aristocratic and/or wealthy mothers enacting the imitatio Mariae. They understood at an experiential level that what they were envisioning themselves doing with the Christ-child was, in fact, *mothering*."

They were hired on a contractor basis to run protection details for specific individuals, both in the private and public sector. The US Govt hired them to do certain tasks and cover dignitaries. And Haliburton/KBR (Dick Cheneys company) hired them to play machine gun bodyguards to cover the oil men. So the difference is they are specifically hired for protection, and not hired in a basis to actually instigate or start battles. Where as a true mercenary would be specifically hired to fight battles. \n\nThat is what the difference is \"supposed\" to be, and what Blackwater was \"supposed\" to do. (And a good majority of them did do).\n\nHowever, the reality of it though is a good portion of blackwater jumped through 1 legal fucking loophole after another... and they sure as shit were mercenaries. 4 \"Contractors\" are serving serious time while their \"boss\" hung them out to dry, and sold blackwater to a group of investors only to make millions. ",
                "Mercenaries are prohibited because they will fight for any side provided that they are paid enough. And therefore have no stake.\n\nContractors are hired by a specific country for security positions. They escort convoys, they help guard bases and offices and such, they are very heavily armed/trained security guards, officially. They don't actually conduct patrols, they don't go out and fight, they aren't meant to be used like soldiers.",
                "Mercenaries don't give a cut of their profits to the governments out to get them. When they do, they become contractors.",
                "Interesting. I did not realize that they were not technically Mercs.\n\nA distinction without a difference, in my view. ",
                "The geneva convention lays down a very specific definition of \"Mercenary\" making it easy for anything to escape that title. Lots of private military contractors provide support, training, protection, etc. so its difficult to to pin down a single definition of who and what they are. For a *really* good deep dive into this topic, check out \"The Modern Mercenary\". I'm about half way through, but really interesting stuff. ",

                "The difference is mercenaries are hired guns that are paid to do one thing (Fight an opposing force, asssasinate someone, etc.) and generally have no rules or protocols to follow in order to get that task accomplished. \n\nBlackwater (now known as Academi) and companies like them are contractors who work under a strict contract which details what they are supposed to do and how to do it. They are known to provide security for individuals, businesses, government buildings, bases, etc. They also might be hired to train soldiers and in some rare cases aid them in a mission/operation. This is where it gets choppy because since they aren't acting under military law and rules they can't be Court Marshaled or otherwise tried as part of the nations military, which sometimes allows them to use it as a loophole. This is certainly rare as most of them wouldn't do this because it would be a breach of contract and they wouldn't get paid but it does happen. \n\nI don't know if this was posted in light of the 4 former Blackwater members being tried recently for the massacre of Iraqi civilians, but I glad those murders are being sentenced finally.

                "how does one sign up for Blackwater?",
                "Alright, this is actually something that I can answer with an informed and well supported view. I'm currently studying for my Master's degree in international security and have studied private military. According to Peter Singer, author of *Corporate Warriors*, there are 6 essential characteristics that distinguish mercenaries from other combatants and military organisations:\n\n1. *Foreign:* \"A mercenary is not a citizen or resident of the state in which he or she is fighting\"\n\n2. *Independence:* \"A mercenary is not integrated (for the long term) into any national force and is bound only by the contractual ties of a limited employee\"\n\n3. *Motivation:* \"A mercenary fights for the individual short-term economic reward, not for political or religious goals\"\n\n4. *Recruitment:* \"Mercenaries are brought in by oblique and circuitous ways to avoid legal prosecution\"\n\n5. *Organisation:* \"Mercenary units are temporary and ad-hoc groupings of individual soldiers\"\n\n6. *Services:* \"Lacking prior organization, mercenaries focus on just combat service, for single clients\"\n\nTo counter these characteristics, there are 6 reasons why private military firms (PMFs) are different:  \n\n1. *Organisation:* \"Prior corporate structure\"\n\n2. *Motives:* \"Business profit-driven, rather than individual profit-driven\"\n\n3. *Open Market:* \"Legal, public entities\"\n\n4. *Services:* \"Wider range, varied clientele\"\n\n5. *Recruitment:* \"Public, specialised\"\n\n6. *Linkages:* \"Ties to corporate holdings and financial markets\"\n\nBasically, mercenaries are usually assembled on an ad-hoc basis and are in it for individual profit motives. Additionally, they generally only offer simple combat services, rather than the vast array of services that PMFs can provide. PMFs are corporations that hire personnel usually on contractual bases, and these persons can provide a wide range of services. \n\nToday, modern militaries rely heavily on private military firms to help them function. While firms like what was previously known as Blackwater provide services at the forefront of operations, there are other types of companies that provide consultancy and support and logistics. So while one PMF may provide a private security detail of a VIP, another firm could build military bases and installations, operate mess halls, service latrines, or control the supply chain. The operations of *military provider* PMFs certainly falls under a grey area of international law, but other types of PMFs may be more black and white than you'd expect. I hope this gives you a better understanding of the key differences between mercenaries and private military companies. ",
                "PMC's, or private military contractors, are supposed to be used defensively by definition. Mercenaries are defined as offensive, which makes them illegal, but the difference is hazy.",
                "ELI5:\nPrivate military contractors are contracted to provide services for non-inherent government functions (defensive, maintenance of infrastructure, logistics like fuel and water, etc.). Mercenaries are contracted to provide services that include inherent government functions. A government function in a battlefield can be considered the conducting of offensive tactical operations. \n\nA little more explanation:\n\n**Private Military Contractors** or PMCs for short such as Blackwater, DynCorp, Aegis, etc., are contracted to provide services for *non-inherent governmental functions*. Non-inherent governmental functions can be serving as an interpreter or providing certain supplies such as water or electrical maintenance for a military base. An inherently governmental function would be conducting offensive operations such as seeking out and eliminating insurgents. \n\n**Mercenaries** are on the other hand contracted to carry out *inherent governmental functions* such as conducting offensive operations. One example is where a company called Executive Outcomes _URL_0_, a Private Military Contractor from South Africa, operated in an offensive tactical role in Equatorial Guinea's 2004 coup d'etat.\n\nPMCs such as Blackwater are sometimes called (*PMC employees sometimes consider the reference mercenaries as a derogatory term*) mercenaries due to the grey areas that a battlefield can provide. Also questions as to how they chose to act within those circumstances have led to this term being leveled against them and the field as a whole. Within the diplomatic security contracts the contractors serve as security details. These contractors are detailed to protect clients (State Department foreign service and other VIPs) from hostile encounters. Example would be a client is driven to meet with some elders of a community and mortar fire is reported to be incoming. The contractors are alerted and the contractors extract the client to a safe location. \n\nThe role of the contractor in this example is to use all options to disengage and get the client to safety. However if they are tactically cornered or the client is pulled away from the detail, the contractors are to engage and attempt to recover the client and then get to safety. This can also lead to calling in any local military support if this occurs. How tactical situations arise and how choices are made to engage or disengage can result in an ambiguous grey area leading to questions about the roles of PMCs and how much their roles overlap the line between governmental functions and non governmental functions.\n\nSource:\nI worked within the Diplomatic Security / Private Military Contractor (PMCs) field (not Blackwater, but a competitor) for several years, mostly in efforts relating to deploying personnel to and from theater.  After leaving that line of work I subsequently studied the gov't policies revolving the High Threat Protection Diplomatic Contracts as part of my Masters Program, but I am by no means an expert in this! \n\nedit:Removed some bolding",
                "A lot of FUD here, to be expected from a pretty loaded question.  But to truly understand this, one has to understand the problem the Geneva convention was trying to solve.\n\nMercenaries saw wide use across Europe before the advent of professional volunteer armies, which really only saw their first use in medieval Europe relatively recently - with the Spanish Tercios of the mid 1500s.  Before that, and for a long time after that wars between feudal lords were fought almost exclusively by proxy mercenary armies.  Some wars were fought almost exclusively by mercenaries on both sides.  Anyone who had some money and a claim could raise an army and cause general havoc among established nation states.  This was a serious problem that caused frequent chaos, enabling non state actors to act as nation states.  Coups, looting, unrest, all this enabled by the heavy use of mercenaries.  This is the problem the the conventions seek to address - by eliminating the ability of non state actors to purchase foreign armies that can overrun countries.\n\nBlackwater, in that context are really not what would be recognized as mercenaries in a historical context.  For the most part, they are citizens of the state they fight for, they don't have the ability to wage a war on their own.  For example, you couldn't just buy Blackwater services to take over a country and install yourself as king.  And so, Blackwater is probably more similar to a volunteer based state actor regular army, than a non state mercenary per the Geneva convention.  There's nowhere in the convention that defines a mercenary as someone who doesn't receive a direct salary from the state.  Many of the first professional militarized were not compensated this way.",
                "I thought Blackwater changed its name and was going to or did merge with Triple Canopy. ",
                "You can't use mercenaries to fight your war but you can hire them to provide security for your personnel.  \n\nAlso the part of the definition of mercenaries is that they are not nationals of one of the nations involved.  So if all your mercenaries are from your nation you get a pass.",
                "America decided that international courts don't apply to them  \nNicaragua case: - international court says 'hey america, stop running around with soldiers in a foreign country' court rules 'we're the law', by that logic, no court can prosecute america.    \nUN prosecuting body the international criminal court- america makes it not have universal jurisdiction so they only apply to nations that join up. - Henry Kissinger is the driving force behind this.  \nBut what if your on a signatories land doing war crimes, what if afghanistan is signed up?. - America creates bilaterial immunity agreements (Coined 'bilateral impunity agreement') with nations saying 'here take some money and write into statute, if you prosecute our people we'll find them and take em back'  - E.g Afghanistan signed this for an 8 billion infrastructure deal.  \nI have sources but I'm writing this pretty quickly, feel free to challenge me I'm sure there's more to it.",
                "Blackwater(and other such compares) are hired as bodyguards/guards(and along these lines) and not as mercenaries which is why they are \"legal\". Mercenaries are paid to fight a war and are hired to engage enemies. Blackwater does not necessarily engage enemies(unless attacked) but who knows, they could be willingly driving in some area known as an enemy territory, see some people and attack them because they are \"suspicious\", \"on the verge of attacking\" or as a \"precautionary defense\".\n",

I know it seems like a slight difference, but it means a lot in terms of ROE (rules of engagement). I'm an Army Vet and I worked with a lot of paramilitary contractors. ",

                "I could not say if he was the \"first\" candidate to do so, but Lyndon Johnson, in his 1948 race for Texas's vacant U.S. Senate seat against retired Governor Coke Stevenson, relied on a _significant_ fundraising disparity to close the gap between him, and the massively popular Texas statesman. \n\nRobert Caro's _Years of Lyndon Johnson_ -- and especially book 2, _Means of Ascent_ -- describes Johnson's political empire as a little-discussed network of major corporate donors, forming a veritable who's-who of major Texas industrialists: Sid Richardson (oil magnate and philanthropist [he was later a major donor to Rice University]) , Herman Brown and George R. Brown of Brown  &  Root (which would be acquired by Halliburton on the latter's death), and Alan J. Wirtz (businessman/politician). Money made its way to Johnson's campaigns through the ordinary means of above-board contributions up to the then-existing limit of $5,000.00; then, it reached him in cash-stuffed envelopes, hand-collected and hand-delivered by aides. \n\nAll of this meant that when Johnson declared against Stevenson, the latter's ordinary time-tested means of campaigning -- driving town to town, sitting and speaking with voters in town squares -- was quickly overmatched. By circumventing campaign finance caps, Johnson was able to blanket the Texas airwaves in a manner unprecedented in early-modern politics -- helped, of course, by the fact that he owned, through is wife, several major local radio stations -- and even hired two helicopters to take him on a jet-age version of a whistle-stop tour of the state. \n\nEven that wasn't enough to win the race, which dissolved into allegations of vote-rigging and fraud, and ultimately had to be resolved [in court](_URL_0_) when Johnson claimed to have \"won\" by under 100 votes. Caro makes a persuasive case, based on an interview with the only south-Texas party operative still alive at the time he wrote the book, that the decisive votes were in fact invented. It's a good and depressing read.\n\nNote: the $5,000.00 limit Johnson worked under (and circumvented) was a product of the 1939 Hatch Act. The Federal Election Campaign Act of 1972 would lower the individual cap to $1,000.00 per candidate, with a per-cycle individual cap of $25,000.00. The per-candidate and aggregate caps were both found constitutional in *Buckley v. Valeo*, 424 U.S. 1 (1976). The aggregate cap was invalidated in the recent case of *McCutcheon v. F.E.C.*, 572 U.S. ___ (2014), and the $1,000.00/candidate cap was increased by the \"McCain/Feingold\" Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act.",

                "Rachel Herrmann published a great article about this a few years ago in *William and Mary Quarterly* - you can find it [here](_URL_0_).  She argues that while \"historians generally take the case of cannibalism in Jamestown for\ngranted\" in fact \"the existence of cannibalism in Virginia is not easily verifiable.\" While Herrmann acknowledges accounts like John Smith's:\n\n >  so great was our famine, that a Salvage we slew, and buried,\nthe poorer sort tooke him up againe and eat him, and so did divers\none another boyled and stewed with roots and herbs: And one\namongst the rest did kill his wife, powdered her, and had eaten\npart of her before it was knowne, for which hee was executed, as\nhee well deserved; now whether shee was better roasted, boyled\nor carbonado’d, I know not, but of such a dish as powdered wife I\nnever heard of\n\nHerrmann argues that:\n\n > Cannibalism may or may not have taken\nplace during 1609–10; some evidence exists to suggest that it did, whereas\nother accounts might be cited to argue that it did not. Ultimately, there is\nno way to answer this particular question definitively... What historians can do is consider the various accounts together and acknowledge that cannibalism should no longer be stated as a bare fact in the chronology of early Jamestown.\n\n**The kicker here** is that 2 years after Herrmann published, archeologists announced that they had uncovered **physical evidence of cannibalism:** the remains of a young girl (about age 14), who had very clearly been dismembered, and whose bones were found in a heap of bones from dogs, cats, and horses that had also been consumed during the starving time:\n\n > “The chops to the forehead are very tentative, very incomplete,” says Douglas Owsley, the Smithsonian forensic anthropologist who analyzed the bones after they were found by archaeologists from Preservation Virginia. “Then, the body was turned over, and there were four strikes to the back of the head, one of which was the strongest and split the skull in half. A penetrating wound was then made to the left temple, probably by a single-sided knife, which was used to pry open the head and remove the brain.”\n\n > [...]\n\n > Lead archaeologist William Kelso today at a press conference at the National Museum of Natural History, we now have the first direct evidence of cannibalism at Jamestown, the oldest permanent English colony in the Americas. “Historians have gone back and forth on whether this sort of thing really happened there,” Owsley says. “Given these bones in a trash pit, all cut and chopped up, it's clear that this body was dismembered for consumption.”\n\n[source](_URL_1_)\n\nThe archeological evidence is pretty conclusive, and it's confirmation that settlers were desperate enough to eat other people (along with dogs, cats, horses, etc).

                "There is no real rule of thumb. It depends on the balance of power and the prestige of the various languages, although population size can have an influence. For instance, Gaul was romanised because the Roman culture became the more prestigious one in the region. So first the local elite started speaking Latin, and then it seeped down to the rest of the population. By the time the Franks came, Latin was the still the language of prestige (since the Roman empire still existed), and Latin was also the language of the majority of the population, so they adopted Latin.\n\nIn Britain on the other hand, Latin had never rooted as much, and the Anglo-Saxons brought a new culture of prestige, so over time their language became the prestigious one.\n\nUltimately, it is impossible to predict, as it always is with language change. Prestige and population size are important, but it also depends on how stubborn people are, how much communication there is between the speakers of the different languages, how much a ruler might press the use of his native language, and all kinds of factors."

                "So the cool thing about biology is that we're all just \"chemistry buckets\". We're just a lot of very advanced chemistry, and chemistry dictates everything we are.\n\nProteins are a family of molecule that are actually very diverse. They can make structures, like cell walls and fingernails. But again -- just chemicals. They're not \"smart\". A protein has a job to do, and it does it. Keratin, which is one of the proteins that make up hair and nails, is shaped so that it lines itself up into structures. \n\nOther proteins carry \"messages\" from one place to another. Really that just means that some protein is sent into the blood, where it travels the whole body -- cause again, just a sack of chemistry -- and eventually it'll find a place that it fits. And when it does \"fit\" into something, that something may react, maybe by producing other chemicals.\n\nProteins also break down other materials (enzymes), can attack pathogens, and do lots more. \n\nDNA itself is the protein cookbook. It's also just a chemical; a huge one, but a chemical nonetheless. In labs, to inspect DNA, they actually grow more of it. You just take DNA, and throw it into a soup of other chemicals that replicate DNA (those same chemicals found in the body) and then you cook it, and boom, you have a lot more DNA.\n\nEither way, there's another chemical that interacts with DNA. It latches onto a bit of DNA, takes its shape, falls away and then another chemical comes in and builds a protein from that shape. It's almost like taking a cast and then a mold of something you want to sculp. The DNA is huge and \"codes\" lots of different proteins -- all your proteins, in fact -- but the RNA only needs to interact with a section at a time. \n\nAnd remember still, nothing \"smart\" is happening here. It's just several chemical reactions, one after another. \n\nBut because DNA is the template for every protein your body uses, it defines your whole body. There's one protein that causes the gold flecks around the ring of your iris (in your eye) -- some people have it, some people don't. But at no point do these biological tools make \"decisions\"; the DNA doesn't \"control\" a cell in the sense that it's directing traffic. It's just a very complex system of different chemicals interacting with each other and producing different effects."

We don't really know how likely it is for life to begin from scratch. Nick Lane is a well-known author and researcher who has [written on the subject](_URL_1_).\n\nSome strong indicators might be: \n\nIf it did not use DNA or RNA to store information.\n\nIt might not be carbon-based life, which would be good evidence it was not terrestrial. \n\nWe can trace the origins of a subset of genes (~6000) back to a single [common ancestor](_URL_2_), so if it lacked any version of these genes it would be a strong indicator. \n\nThe Venter Institute has being doing some [cool experiments](_URL_0_) looking for the minimal genome, and have gotten it down to ~250 genes that are essential to life, so if something was existing with a different set of core genes that could be a strong indicator.",

It could be the alien lifeform is based on different chemistry, or perhaps it's similar but has unusual chromosomes. Something to that effect. \n\nIt would be compelling if there was something that was from their own evolution path that allowed them to exist on specifically other planets, which wouldn't be necessary on Earth like not needing oxygen.",

                "Assuming this hypothetical alien has DNA, a good way to determine non-terrestrial origin would be to isolate the [Base Pairs](_URL_0_) in said DNA. All life on Earth uses the same nucleobases of Cytosine, Guanine, Adenine, and Thymine (and in RNA, Thymine is replaced by Uracil). If the lifeform's DNA (or DNA-analog) does not utilize the same nucleobases, then it is safe to say that it evolved from a different \"primordial ooze\". \n\nAs others have also said, however, isotope ratios would also point to an origin other than Earth or even our solar system. This pertains to the original formation of our solar system, and the geological process that resulted in heavier elements (easily identifiable, radioactive elements in trace amounts) that are ubiquitous in life on Earth. Different types of stars produce different amounts of various elements, and the ratios would easily identify a nonterrestrial origin.",
                "If it is DNA based, compare codon sequences for the amino acids. It is highly unlikely that there would be much similarity to life on Earth.

                "Older answer from the Waterloo AMA:\n\nNo. Britain had plenty of festivities planned but they were mostly cancelled. \n\nMany of the usual activities for Waterloo celebrations were impossible or impractical. Dinners between regiments were impractical because of the war. Visits to the battlefield were planned but cancelled because the Germans currently occupied the battlefield. The Royal United Services had planned to unveil a Waterloo museum, but it was pushed back. \n\nOf course the victors at Waterloo still used it for propaganda purposes. Images of Wellington and Blucher were still positive. But most of the German celebrations focused on the liberation of Germany from occupying French forces in 1812 (there were massive celebrations in Germany to commemorate the anniversary in 1912) as opposed to Waterloo. \n\nEdit:\n\nJust to add Russia had issues celebrating because they had been moving closer towards France and thus had issues celebrating victories over Napoleon. \n\nAustria had issues celebrating because they had no victories over Napoleon to celebrate (heh). \n ",
                "The Battle of Waterloo occupied an anomalous place in 1915. The battle site itself had narrowly avoided becoming a battlefield the prior year and the Germans controlled this corner of Flanders for the remainder of the conflict. Although the local German commander of the region held a small parade on the centennial, according to an American journalist, the German commander used it as an opportunity to harangue the British for their perfidy. The largest Waterloo celebration was arguably at Hanover, where an estimated crown of 100000 gathered at the Waterloo Column to celebrate the past victory of German arms. Hanover's museum held an exhibition of Waterloo artifacts, but only those of German provenance. Hanover was the exception and because wartime events had forced the cancellation of parades and celebratory reenactments of Waterloo, both Britons and Germans had to devise creative means to mark the occasion of the centennial. \n\nA good deal of the celebrations were symbolic in nature.  In the context of the entente, one of the more obvious ways to simultaneously memorialize Waterloo and serve the war effort was to stage commemorations of the battle as symbols of international reconciliation with France. For example, on the June anniversary witnessed *The Times* recorded several instances of reconciliation on both a state and private level. In Paris, the oldest British residents “placed a wreath in the new cemetery at Neuilly- sur-Seine, where lie many French and British soldiers who fought and fell in the Battle of the Marne.” The London authorities placed a heart-shaped ivy wreath, wrapped with a tricoleur ribbon, around Wellington’s equestrian statue in Hyde Park. Paris matched this courtesy by attaching bouquets of red, white, and blue carnations around the wax statues of Napoleon and Wellington in Madame Tussard’s museum.  Furthermore, the centenary memory would develop further the idea that Waterloo represented a titanic military struggle between two equals. A Times editorial stated that:\n\n > To remember [Waterloo] is to praise [French] qualities; for we should recall this victory with less pride had it been gained over an army less glorious and a captain less renowned; and for all our appreciation of- Wellington’s genius and of the courage and tenacity of \tour soldiers, we know well how easily victory might have been turned into defeat had not \tNapoleon's good fortune deserted him on the field of battle.\n \nTwo weeks prior to the centennial, the Royal Artillery elected to honor the graves of its Waterloo fallen. Eventually they found forty-one graves and placed a small wreath on them.  At a Waterloo Day luncheon in Woolwich the Royal Artillery officers present marked the event with a quiet remembrance. According to a publication put out by the Royal Artillery, the officers  were asked to “honor the names and memories of Artilleryman of all ranks, who fought at Waterloo and to remember those men of today who are fighting with the same bravery as our men of 1815.”  At Wellington College, annual Waterloo Day Banquet, originally funded by a subscription from Wellington himself, had been cancelled in lieu of a memorial service for the alumni killed in the current conflict. *The Times* reported that before the ceremony, the current Duke of Wellington planted an acorn taken from the grave of Copenhagen, Wellington’s famous horse.  Both the Wellington College ceremony and that of the Royal Artillery prefigured that of the postwar commemorations of the war which involve gestures and solemnity to properly honor the dead.\n\nGerman symbolic commemoration often took the form of contextualizing the dead within the context of the German *Heimat* or homeland. One of the *Heimat* journals  *Niedersachsen* bimonthly published a special centennial issue. The expressed hope of this issue’s editor was the erection of a worthy monument for the King’s German Legion will be erected in Hannover when the chance of an honorable peace is near.  This issue celebrated the heroes of Lower Saxony, including luminaries like Duke Frederick William and the general Christian von Ompteda, but the issue also delved into the life of the ordinary soldier as well. For example, the issue reproduced the silhouette of sergeant in a minor militia battalion.  Although not completely free of the wartime-era bombast, the commemorative issue reproduced many of the existing monuments and gravesites of the Lower Saxon Waterloo heroes, thus grounding the memory into local culture. The issue closed with a use of commemorative memory that drew an indirect but distinct comparison to the current wartime environment: a list of the dead and wounded officers from Quatre-Bras and Waterloo, arranged by unit, rank, and name.  In this circuitous way, this *Heimat*-centered centennial of Waterloo draws upon the power of the dead by recreating a more modern form of remembrance.\n\nBut beyond just commemorating the dead, the centennial in wartime was often an excuse to trot out chauvinism and mobilize the past to fight the present conflict. One curious example of this iteration of memory was when both nations engaged in a loose dialogue with each other around a curious rumor about the Lion’s Mound at Waterloo. 18 June issue of *The Times* reported that 1,500 German soldiers were at work to dismantle the 31-ton bronze lion atop one of the most prominent landmarks of the battlefield, the massive artificial earth embankment erected to honor the Prince of Orange in 1820.  The article cited an anonymous source for this story and treated it as a straightforward example of German destruction of Belgian monuments such as the destruction of Louvain the year before. In reality, the Lion’s Mound remained intact during the war and the The Times story has all the symptoms of typical wartime atrocity rumor. Such accounts frequently combined an unsubstantiated report from a few witnesses with a strong tendency to believe in the enemy’s worst instincts.  Rather than let this bit of wartime gossip lie fallow, the German magazine *Jugend* with  a comedic retort to this British atrocity story. After reassuring its readers that the story is false, the magazine published a poem “Der Löwe von Waterloo” by A. D. Nora wherein the lion itself had abandoned the field due to the behavior of the British:\n\n  > When he saw Wellington’s heirs allied [with the French]\n >  Murderously full of hate and anger\n > towards the grandchildren of Blücher’s\n > German blood, the Germanic blood of\n > The noble lion seized\n > Such loathing of today\n > That he tucked in his tail \n > And with animalistic haste\n > Descended from its heights\n > And no one knows whither he fled\n > Yes, that I could understand well\n > Poor Lion of Waterloo! \n\nAlthough comedic in tone, the poem insinuated British malfeasance when they elected to side with the French. The lion’s disgust with this choice amounted to an assertion by A. D. Nora that contemporary Britons had relinquished their birthright to the battle.\n\n"

                "Volunteer fire fighter here. Our station is ran by the county. Our city owns a very old (50s) fire truck and the county loans the other two. We are insured by the county and receive survivor benefits in case of Injury. As far as being paid, these outfits are usually in locations where the city is unable to afford it and relies on volunteers. Realistically it is volunteer so if somebody doesn't feel like going they have nobody to answer to. Hopefully I answered your question.",
                "My father worked as a volunteer firefighter in his township for many years. More or less it was just a tiny little town with a bunch of townies hopping on the truck. Population was next to nothing. I think it peaked under 600?\n\nHe had scanners set up in one of the offices that he could hear throughout the lower level of the house and he carried the push to talk Nextel of the time. The town was small enough that the post office didn’t even deliver. So the guys would hear the call, hop in the car and respond. \n\nSomething like 80% of that town lived below the poverty line, and realistically they couldn’t afford full time firefighters. County took the calls and put them out on the radio as reported structure fires, accidents with entrapment and the guys just ran. If I remember correctly neighboring townships responded to fires as well. Everyone just sort of showed up.",
                "I was a volunteer FF back when I was younger. The village I grew up in was 100% volunteer. No paid skeleton crew or drivers. To staff a paid department costs lots of taxpayer dollars. Yes, the firehouses and gear costs, but think about the salaries, benefits, utilities for the crews while on duty. It adds up to lots of money. And this was mid 80s when you didn't have the level of gear that's around now, and required. It was sort of unspoken that if an employee working in town for you was a volunteer, you allowed them to respond. It wasn't required, but it could be your house I was responding to. At any given fire call, you could have maybe 5-8 guys (at the time we didn't have any females), or 35. Just depended on the time, day, weather. Yes, there were those that you knew wouldn't respond after a certain time, or if it was raining/snowing out. They were more members for the social, and networking aspects of it. The dedicated guys were the ones that were there at 3am to a known false alarm (the typical pulled ones or faulty alarms), or still there at 2am rolling up hoses after the call.",
                "Yeah so often times in the volunteer depts they have a cheif and maybe an assistant chief that are paid. Other than that everyone is volunteer. But here's the thing, in a very rural town where there isn't a lot to do, church, school and the Vol Fire dept are your social clubs. So basically in the small towns they guys all build up a friendship with each other so people will always show up because that's what you do for your friend.",
                "I'm on a small \"volunteer\" fire department. We don't have enough money or calls to have a crew of guys sitting at the station getting paid all day so we all go about our day and respond to calls when they come in and when we can. Sometimes we're short staffed and call in mutual aid from a nearby department. We do get paid tho, something to the tune of $30-40 a call. That can be good pay for a silly disregard or shit pay for a 4 hour fire, but I find that the guys here don't care much about the money. We get something in the range of 5 calls a week, usually at 3:00 am or so🙃. \nWe train twice a month and have a meeting once a month.

Small towns would either have to do without a fire department or rely on nearby cities to dispatch firefighters to them.\n\n\"Volunteer\" firefighters have regular jobs, but carry a pager so they can respond to fires (or sometimes as support to paramedics) in town.\n\nWhile they're on a call they're usually paid a little bit. They also get pretty solid tax incentives where I'm from. They also get the training they would need to get hired as a career firefighter.\n\nIt's a good gig...",
                "I was a volunteer firefighter in Suburban Philadelphia for around 20 years.  I'm still a \"member\" of the company but I no longer go out on fire calls.\n\nIn our situation, the fire station is owned by the township along with the fire apparatus (four engines, a ladder truck, a rescue truck and a utility \"tactical\" vehicle).  The firefighting gear is owned by the fire company, which is a non-profit corporation.  Funds to purchase equipment are provided by a \"Relief Association\" which is a separate nonprofit corporation that gets its funding from the state.  The state gets the money from a tax that it imposes on insurance companies that write policies on properties in the township.  If you buy homeowners or property insurance, a portion of your premium goes to the state via a tax, which is dedicated to the local volunteer fire company to fund equipment purchases (turnout gear, air packs, rubber gloves, medical equipment, etc.).\n\nWe also have pledge drives where we'd send out requests for donations to the public.\n\nAs to why they're not paid?  It costs a lot of money to outfit a paid fire department.  Salaried firefighters are not cheap, and they usually require decent benefit and pension packages  Money doesn't grow on trees so towns with paid fire departments have to raise taxes to pay for them.  Most suburban and rural towns don't have enough incidents to justify a full-time paid department and the substantial increase in tax burden that it would bring.\n\nThe problem today is that there aren't enough volunteers.  We rely on \"mutual aid\" systems where if there's an incident in my township, the county will dispatch fire companies from neighboring townships and boroughs too in order to help insure that enough people show up.  The best time to have your house catch on fire is 7:30 on a Tuesday night when we're all at the fire house for training.  The worst time is 1:00 on a weekday afternoon when everyone is at work or school and can't get away to run off to the fire station.",

It is up to the members to decide how to spend the money (following municipal fiscal policies)\nWe are 100% volunteer and receive no financial compensation.\n We do not have the population density to justify hiring career firefighters, the municipality just wouldn't be able to afford it, which I would say is the case for most of Canada and the United States, the tax base just isn't there to support paid firefighters.",

I typically receive about 600 dollars a year, a tax credit, and a couple free meals."

Try it with fruit, like fresh cut peaches and cream. Try it in your coffee and watch it unfurl...it's absolutely beautiful.  It is probably the only cream I would put in tea.  You would use this for making homemade ice cream.\n\nLight cream is the lighter, less fat version of heavy cream. No good use, since if you want \"diet\" cream you came to the wrong place. You probably should just be using less heavy cream. \n\nWhipping cream is for whipping.  Add sugar. Takes alot of arm strength, or a mixer.  I believe it is lighter than regular heavy cream which helps it to whip easier. I don't know about heavy whipping cream, as I've only tried to make homemade whipped cream once and I dont know if I bought whipping cream or heavy whipping cream.",

I've tried them all. I always have some on hand - it's a staple.\n\nIt is perfect in coffee in the morning, providing a richness with less cream needed vs. say a half-and-half. It blends nice when I mix it with marinara for a cream sauce on pasta, works great in home made cream of chicken soup, is amazing poured over sliced up strawberries or peaches with a sprinkle of sugar, adding a smidge gives fluffiness to scrambled eggs, and I can flat out make kick-ass whip cream from it that puts cool whip to shame, for dessert / milkshake toppings, etc.\n\nYep, heavy whipping cream.

                "Adapted from an earlier answer of mine.\nThe focus is less on the Cuban economic situation (which I'm less familiar with) and more on why the Cuban international missions proved a durable strategy, with a focus on Angola.\n\n\n\nFrom the start, Cuba's military interventions were accompanied by social contributions, also drawing on the experiences of the extensive inner-Cuban literacy and medical campaigns that began shortly after the revolution. F. Castro had spoken out against the perils of illiteracy as early as 1953, and initiated a national literacy campaign in 1961. While official figures have to be treated with caution, we know that the 8-month long campaign was a success, and led to UNESCO declaring the country free of illiteracy. Another point to keep in mind here is Cuba's tactic of international solidarity, which could mean military aid esp. in the 60s' and 70s', but also and increasingly after the fall of the Soviet Union a form of \"medical diplomacy\". Humanitarian missions were meant to improve Cuba's foreign relations. With the end of the Soviet Union, then Cuba's main economic and military supporter, there was a marked shift from military to humanitarian interventions, with Cuba's foreign troops returning home. \n\nI won't go into detail here because of the 25 years rule, but a few years ago around 35,000 Cubans were still occupied in more than 70 countries in various fields. On the one hand, we have cases of Cuba gaining new allies through emergency aid (as in Honduras), and of medical exchanges connected to economic advantages, as with Venezuelan oil payments. On the other hand, it seems difficult not to see a motivation of solidarity and cooperation at play in these large-scale actions, as with the medical school ELAM which educates international students mostly free of charge, in order to let them use this knowledge in their home countries - also strengthening Cuba's prestige e.g. in Latin America and Africa.\n\nDuring the campaign in Angola, the Cuban-Angolan cooperation was the basis for the construction of governmental structures and of national education there, employing around 50,000 Cuban civilians until 1991 and thereby strengthening the MPLA's position. I'm going into this Angolan example some more below to show how especially educational aid could function, as well as its limitations - hopefully as a useful parallel to your question on medical aid, which would often (but not always) be used in tandem.\n\n​**Cuban education in Angola**\n\nIn a fascinating book on the topic (\"*Kubaner in Angola: Süd-Süd-Kooperation und Bildungstransfer 1976-1991*\"), Christine Hatzky talks of \"South-South cooperation\", highlighting how two non-Western countries worked together in times of the Cold War -- both in order to further their own goals. Turning to Angola: From the early 1960's opposition to the Portuguese colonial regime had started forming. Following the military coup in Portugal 1974, there started the war for independence between various native movements. In 1975 the Angolan MPLA declared independence, backed by the USSR and Cuba. This led to a decades-long civil war with another liberation movement called UNITA until 1991, but continuing afterwards, who had South African (and at some point indirect US) backing.\n\nAlready during the conflict for independence, cooperation between Cuba and Angola constituted a main basis for the construction of political structures in post-colonial Angola. The educational cooperation also meant that methods for stabilising rule were brought from Cuba to Angola, serving to strenthen the MPLA's predominance. The construction of a nation-wide public educational system was an important addition to this tactic -- it was made possible through the employment of thousands of Cuban teachers and pedagogues. It was the biggest civil foreign mission of Cuba until 1991, spanning ca. 50.000 civilians in total, and ca. 10.000 active in education.\n\nBoth powers followed their own political interests in this educational policy in a relatively equal way, without direct interference by the Cold War powers. On the other hand, the Angolan government often made demands on Havana. Angola had a certain leverage due to their financing of the civilian mission, which was kept secret by Havana even from the civilians themselves. Because of this the mission \"based only on solidarity\" as propagated by the Cuban government has to be challenged -- we rather see a direct support of the MPLA, from which Havana profited directly. In the end, the commonly proclaimed goals of the creation of a socialist Angola were not realized, as the MPLA started applying stronger capitalist policies from the 80s onwards.\n\nNow for some more details on the educational policies: The Cuban civilans supported administration and control of the territories claimed by the MPLA. However, due to the mission's large scale the indigenous development of an Angolan educational system was strongly disrupted. For one, not enough Angolan teachers were educated.\n\nOn the one hand the comparatively innovative pedagogical measures taken by Cuban teachers helped to overcome the colonial educational system. On the other hand this was relativized through internal rules: Thus the teachers' work was only measured by the succesfull holding of exams, not by a sustainable transmission of knowledge. One exemption can be mentioned, the formation of a small but very influential Angolan elite, connected to their education in Angola and in Cuban boarding schools.\n\nVarious factors have to be taken into account when talking of a 'failure' of the educational cooperation. First and foremost, it took place during times of civil war, in addition to major South African military interventions. These military conflicts strongly disrupted an literacy campaign (modeled on  the Cuban experience). They also meant that many of the Cuban civilians employed in Angola were traumatised by their time in the country -- something not discussed publicly in Cuba until now. The official Cuban discourse rather highlights the military successes esp. after 1991 - including the decisive Cuban assistance during the huge Cuito Canavale battle, which rebuffed South African involvement in the civil war, and is a reason why Cuba was/is seen as an influence on the end of apartheid in independent South Africa..\n\nIn truth, the small advances made in Angolan education, infrastructure, administration and medicine due to Cuban civil aid were destroyed since the mid '80s by the opponents of war. Until 1992 the Cuban civilians were gradually recalled. One major consequence for Cuba was the professionalisation and economisation of international solidarity, esp. through the building of administrative structures in Angola but also in Cuba itself -- influencing later Cuban humanitarian missions.\n\n---------\n\n**Coming back to your question:** at least for the discussed fields of medical and educational aid, these were strongly tied to Cuban advances made after the revolution. Especially the large scale literacy campaign; and the strong focus on medical education and medical campaigns (including vaccinations and cataract surgery) in Cuba. Cuba could then (and still does) build on these advances in order to \"export\" their expertise as a medical diplomacy - both to gain economic benefits in return, and tied to the ideology of solidarity. These measures have become more important since the fall of the Soviet Union and the end of Soviet military and economic assistance, with such diplomacy providing benefits including oil and allies.\n\n-----------\n\nIncreasingly by the 80s/early 90s, the military missions were seen as less successful than the non-military aid (excluding Cuito Canavale) - with e.g. Che Guevara's doomed Congo mission in the 60s.\nI didn't go into more detail so far on the many main cases of Cuban \"medical diplomaty\" because they mostly fall outside of the 25 years rule, so will just add a bit on those since they seem relevant to the question - they can generally be considered much more successful than the Angolan case. For a few more numbers, since 1960 about 130.000 Cubans have participated in international missions, to places including Guatemala, Pakistan, Bolivia, Indonesia, Beliz, Peru, Mexico, Ecuador, China, El Salvador and Chile for desaster aid. In those 50 years of medical cooperation, more than 85 million patients were treated.\n\nJust to add a more current example, the well-known 'Operacion Milagro' ran in Venezuela from 2005. With the comparatively simple and cheap cataract operations, it's made possible for people to read (again) on a large scale. A different example is the literacy campaign in Bolivia run from 2006 - 2008 with the help of Cuban teachers. Such actions can boost Cuban presitige in these countries in Latin America, but also in Africa and increasingly in Asia, as mentioned above.

I'm hoping you guys can either help me debunk it, or even prove me wrong.\n\nHis suggestion is as follows: Lets say you have a pressure vessel containing gas at 300 bar. You put this 300 bar pressure vessel inside a second pressure vessel which contains gas at 200 bar. And you then put THAT pressure vessel inside a third vessel containing gas at 100 bar. You now have a russian doll pressure vessel system. His theory is that each pressure vessel will need only be designed to withstand 100 bar of pressure since the delta between each layer is 100 bar.\n\nSupposedly this theory would extend to 1000 bar and beyond. \n\nPurely based on theory and ignoring the practicalities of transferring gas in/out of the tanks - is this true/not true and if so, why?",

                "So I am but a humble 3rd year mech. Enr. Student but if these tanks will be used for supplying fuel to something, then in practice this theory may only work via static pressure, the forces being acted upon the Inner walls of the inner vessel would become more prominent as the gas is used from the outer vessel and vice versa, if you use gasses from the inner vessel the outer vessel will impart more forces upon the outer shell of the inner vessel and as you will basically have a section of vacuum inside your other vessel. Now if your vessels are being drained equally in theory this could work assuming uniform pressure ergo your tanks would probably have to be round and there would have to be a perfect seal seperating the outer vessel from the inner vessel with the only point of connection being a one way T valve valve outside of the tanks.\n\nEdit: if you really want to find out then do hoop stress calculations pressure*radius/thickness, there are a few assumptions you can make such as the pressure of the Gass will impart half of its total pressure on the inner walls of the outer vessel and half of its pressure on the outer wall of the inner most pressure, if you have 500 psi in the outer pressure vessel and 250 psi in the inner pressure vessel theoretically the walls of the inner pressure vessel should feel next to no stress other than the compressive forces of the gasses.\n\nEdit2: TLDR, your collegue theory may be true but only in the case that we don't ignore practicalities and such.",

If you can nest every part of your system like that then you can reduce the stress on each layer.  \n\nWhy isn't this the normal way of handling high pressures? Imagine having to build it.  Imagine having to modify parts of the system once it's built.  Imagine having to inspect the system.  It's an absolute nightmare at every level.",
                "I'm an engineer who works with pressure systems. That works on paper, but there are practical problems.\n\n1. Manufacturing: Creating nested means you have more seals between vessels which are prone to leaking, not to mention difficulty of assembly\n2. Inspection: How are you going to inspect the inner vessels?\n3. Pressure regulation? Say you actually need it at 1000 bar. Then you need to regulate the pressure at 900 bar, 800 bar, etc.\n3. Failure: If one fails, then its going to cause a larger than intended pressure differential, and you will have a bad day. (Admittedly, if you have a single vessel that ruptures, you will still have a very bad day. But there will be less shrapnel).\n5. They make pressure vessels that go to 150 Kpsi+. Is this not enough?\n6. As an afterthought, qualifying it would be difficult. A normal pressure vessel would be simple: Do not use above X psi. Put a relief valve on it and done. Safe. With the nested vessel thing, someone's going to mess up and rupture it.\n"

                "\"Jerry\" as a term for German troops is probably a diminutive of \"German\".   It was in use by  British troops in France by early 1916.   The Daily Express quoted it in March 1916 and in September 1916 explained it as \" \"Jerries\" - That is the \"official\" Irish designation of the enemy.\"   It does not appear to have been a particularly derogative term.\n\n\nThe term \"Tommy\" is an abbreviation of \"Thomas Atkins\", a generic term for British soldiers since at least 1815 when the British War Office released the \"General Regulations and Orders\" with sample forms and directions for record keeping where the forms showing how to complete soldiers records used the generic name \"Thomas Atkins\" as an example.   The usage of the name as an exemplar for forms continued to appear in the 1832 version of the direction \"On The Enlisting, The Discharging, and The Pensioning of Soldiers\" and has continued.   By the 1860s, soldiers were commonly using the term in reference to themselves.   There is a complaint letter in the Soldiers Gazette of 1864 signed by \"Tommy Atkins\". In 1890 Rudyard Kipling wrote the poem \"Tommy\", published in the collection \"Barrack Room Ballads\" which established the term as an identifier for the British soldier throughout the English speaking world. \n "

They'll remain a fan long after they graduate, and their kids will probably be fans too.\n\nAs far as the South in particular: in the early 20th century, with a down economy and a whole host of other issues, people in the South had little to be proud of. When their college football teams started winning, they latched onto it as something that they could take pride in. That continues to this day.",
                "It's not that much different than fans of pro sports - It's just that the southeast region of the country was really Underserved by pro teams of any sport.\n\nLook at Baseball - for the longest time, it was pretty much the Braves for that entire region. Other sport leagues are similar, although it has slowly changed.\n\nSo, if your dad and your grandpa were huge fans of Alabama or ole Miss, and went to or listened to every game - guess what you will probably grow up being a fan of?\n\nFWIW, i grew up in NC, where ACC Basketball was king. I think most people who grew up local have more interest to ACC basketball than they do to any professional sport (Except maybe NASCAR), even though now there are pro Football, Hockey and Basketball teams. \n\n",
                "I am from the South, and football is a huge part of the culture. Even Friday Night football at the local high schools is a big event, and it gets competitive. There aren't many pro teams close by, so there's more emphasis on high school and college football there      \n\nBecause of the competiton, a lot of good talent is cultivated at the high school levels in the area, and they play for local colleges and do well there (again part of the culture is staying closer to home)     \n\nNow good talent from other parts of the country hear about these SEC schools doing well and join one of the schools. Repeat this for a few decades, and you get good coaches, good staff, and good players across the conference      \n\nTL:DR; Southern culture loves football, and over time this helps the SEC become a strong conference",

                "Specifically to the SEC, a large portion of the attention comes from the media.  It creates a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy because several SEC teams have been good for extended periods (Alabama, LSU, etc).\n\nWhat winds up happening is that NEXT year, the media ranks those SEC teams highly - and when they inevitably lose against each other, they fall less in the polls because they lost to another highly ranked team.  In other words, they're tough because we say they're tough, so then they go play other tough teams.\n\nThis problem is not nearly as bad as it had been - the SEC hasn't even been a factor in the last two titles or Heisman winners - so part of that myth is falling away.  \n\nOf course this addresses just the \"SEC-specific\" part of your question.  It's also important to note that college football is very cyclical.  Back in the 80-90s, the old Big 8 ruled the roost with teams like Nebraska and Oklahoma being dominant.  During the early 2000s, you saw the rise of teams like Miami (ACC) and USC (then, Pac-10).  The media loves to jump on a bandwagon and the SEC is only the most recent flavor.",
                "The SEC is kind of an anomaly with the level of fan craziness and the level of success as a collective.  I think there are four major factors in play.  \n\nFirst, the amount of football talent that comes out of these states and usually play SEC schools.  I think four of the top five states for producing NFL talent per capita are SEC states.  While there is incredible talent all over college football, it is just deeper in the SEC.  \n\nSecond, the small town culture.  By that I mean in random towns in places like Alabama, Mississippi, or Louisiana there aren't a lot of options for entertainment on Saturday afternoons.  Here in Louisiana (LSU fan here), Saturdays in football season tend to be centered around where you want to watch the LSU game.  Games become social events.\n\nThirdly, as other have mentioned the lack of NFL teams to root doesn't give people the options football fans in other parts of the country have.  Several SEC schools don't have an NFL team in the state.  \n\nLast, SEC fans figured out that other SEC teams doing well will only help their team in the long run.  The streak of NC's helped build a lot of goodwill with the former BCS and now playoff committee.  There is this uneasy alliance where SEC fans will chant \"SEC\" but absolutely hate each.  ",
                "If you ever get the chance OP, go to an SEC football game (especially one that's a big game or heated rivalry), and you'll understand almost instantly. I was always a casual football fan, but being a student at an SEC school I got free season tickets, went to my first game there and fell in love instantly. There's nothing like it. I'm not a huge sports junkie, but I keep up with my NCAA football from August to September.",

Failure to do so would have profound spiritual repercussions. \n\n >  Knight from Europe going to conquer the Holy Land in the name of God\n\nTo be clear, this is a pretty terrible understanding of what the crusades actually were. Only a very small minority of Crusaders actually stayed in the Levant after fulfilling their pledges to visit the Holy Sepulchre, and while possession of the territory was considered important, crusades were first and foremost an act of penitence just like any other pilgrimage. God, after all, expunge all non-believers from the face of the earth, if he so chose. The Islamic possession of Outremer was thus an opportunity provided by god to aid in your spiritual salvation, regardless of actual outcome.\n\nAlso, the formal position of squire was an innovation which significantly postdates the First Crusade, and it is thus unlikely that you would have existed at all.\n\nSome reading:\n\n* Riley-Smith, Jonathan.

                "OK, a small rant at first- **I'm opening AskHistorian and what I see? Anecdotal evidences and *Romeo and Juliet* cited as a source? Has anybody given it a second thought?**\n\nOK, serious answer, but let's start from the bottom.\nDid people marry so early in the past?\nYes. And No. \nThe false impression that people pushed kids into the bed of elders comes from the fact that most written sources deals with the aristocracy who didn't have to think about common folk's problems (described below) but has the most to win and lose in dynastic games- so yes, they married early, but not as early as one might think. \n\nThe line between betrothal and marriage was often very blurred, negotiations about dowry could take years, changing alliances could make a deal not a deal and force to change it, personal reasons like parents claiming that bride is too young or having problems with letting the child go also played a part- so in fact \"young\" was closer to 17-18 than 12.  \n\nPoorer parts of the societies married even later- woman had to gather dowry, men had to inherit land or learn trade before he could support a family (for example apprentices were usually forbidden from marrying). When we look to parish records, the age of women is often above 20. And don't forget that you had to pay for church marriage and got permission from your lord so it wasn't in uncommon for couples to live as \"common-law marriages\" till they could afford proper wedding.\n\nSo what about those child marriages? Technically they were possible (for girls above 12) and sometimes they happened when the situation pushed- especially when survival of the dynasty was imperilled. Now my personal observation- due to unusual circumstances surrounding those weddings they made it to the literature and public conciousness. So we remember 12 years old princesses marrying old men, but forget about those boring 18 years old marrying young men.  Case from my country- everyone knows that 40 something Władysław II Jagiełło married a 12 years old Jadwiga (their child was born 13 years old after ceremony so who knows what happened in private chambers) but his second and fourth brides were 22 and 17 respectively. And his third bride? Mother of 5, widow after 3 husbands, well over 35. So that's all about anecdotes. \n\nNow let's go to the case- I haven't found details about ceremony, but I doubt that he would actually made out with a child- when the bride was younger than 12 the bedding ceremony turned into purely innocent sleeping side by side. If someone was really eager, he could bare his and her legs up to the knees. After such \"consummation\" marriage still theoretically could be cancelled, but Church jurisdiction simply wouldn't take seriously a full ceremony with so young girl.\nAnd international reaction? Apart from those who actually lost something with this match it was probably \"meh\", since I haven't seen any trace about moral sithstorm you could expect. \n\nEdit: from the initial shock I forget about resources- Jacques le Goff and his \"L'umo medievale\" about the age of marriage and  \"Kronika Kobiet\" by Maria Żmigrodzka-Wolska for details about bedding. \n\n"

In terms of composition that really depends on the director. But one key difference is that they have more time and larger teams to do things than someone not paid to do it. The director gets a shitload of footage to cut together from pieces he or she likes in post production. They storyboard scenes typically and run through them a bunch of times (if time permits), this gives them numerous selections of each frame from the scene, which they can cut together to make the best of what they've got. They also have booms, which are those microphones on sticks that you see in blooper reels. The boom allows them to record audio separate to the camera, which also lets a sound engineer pimp it out to sound ideal for whatever's going on. And let's not underestimate the skill of the camera operators, who've been doing it for years and therefore have excellent motor control, as well as a keen eye for where the camera should be focusing (not just looking in a general direction but where it doesn't blur the image, you'll notice most shows use at least slight depth of field to make the actors or important parts of a shot \"pop\").

An L cut is when the audio from one track starts before the visuals of that shot. This makes the transition into that shot much smoother and less jarring. There are plenty of techniques in editing like this. \n\nEach movie has a rythm in its editing.  An editor needs to find the rythm for the film and edit the film accordingly. For an action flick it probably has a fast rythm. For a romantic drama it might have a slow pace. For fast pace each shot in the time line shouldn't be longer than a few seconds. For slow pace each shot might be 5 seconds or longer. Having a defined rythm really makes a clip more enjoyable and professional. \n\nA lot of amateur editors edit each shot to long. My film teacher would always say only show what you have too and keep each shot as short as possible. (unless you are purposely keeping long takes). \n\nFor sound, recording at least 60 seconds of ambient noise at each location can really help the editor fix audio mistakes. \n\nAlso color grading so that all the shots match in hue and saturation also improves the quality of a video. But if it's over done it can look amateurish. \n\nThat's just some stuff. If anyone is interested I can talk about other techniques and tricks when I get out of class. \n",

You touch a hot plate and even before you can process what happened you pull the hand away, it's a subconscious reflex to avoid harm driven by pain. You see an attractive male/female you sometimes get a desire to have intimate relationship with them, it's a normal biological reaction which helps you have offspring. Animals have the same drive, but aren't held back by social standards, morality etc. They feel hunger, they feel thirst they try to eat/drink. They seek safety, refuge, have urges to protect their offspring. Basically they have every primal instinct we have, but they don't have the ability to process it like we do, to attribute importance to them, to contemplate it.\n\nIn essence they're just a little life form bound by rules of action - reaction caused by chemicals in their body, which are produced for them to react to external stimuli. They aren't self-aware. They are just a biological computer bound by a set of rules, even humans are, only difference is we can evaluate our actions on a deeper level and avoid some of the primal impulses we have, because of our societal guidelines.\n\nI'm sorry if I didn't answer your question like you wanted it to, but I feel like there is no right or wrong answer for it.",
                "No one knows. Consciousness is one of the greatest mysteries of science and philosophy, and, though our instinct might suggest that all moderately complex animals have some form of it, there's relatively no hard evidence one way or another. \n\nAn even more intriguing (yet in some ways itself quite illuminating) question is \"what might consciousness be like for an animal that seems conscious yet has no centralized brain at all, like a lobster?\" Further, if we say something without a centralized brain can have consciousness, who's really to say that something like a plant doesn't?\n\nI'm barely scratching the surface here, so  I'd advise looking elsewhere for perhaps an ELI15 answer. I like Dennett as a jumping off point, but I'm on a mobile so hard to grab a good link. Personally (and this is WIDELY debated), I think many animals likely have some kind of consciousness, but language is the defining feature of anything that looks at all like human consciousness, so much so that you'd barely recognize a chicken's \"consciousness\" as such if you were somehow transported into its head. \n\nEdit: word",
                "Very simple organisms run like a programmed computer. For example, at the cellular level (edit: as in, a single celled organism), consciousness probably doesn't exist. However, as you increase in complexity, you get consciousness. A lot of scientists think that consciousness stems from underlying biological processes, which has sparked the 'does free will even exist' debate (which is a totally different topic). The examples used in your post (rodents and insects) could have consciousness. Many rodents are actually highly and surprisingly intelligent. Insects are more mysterious, they *could* have [consciousness](_URL_0_).",
                "We can't even agree on [what consciousness is like for humans](_URL_0_).  Trying to understand what other, non-human organisms perceive is far more difficult than that.\n\nFrom *what we can observe*, it appears that they operate like biological computers.  However, those same observations can be made about any living creature, including humans.  There have been a lot of studies done which show that humans are less in charge of their own decisions than they think they are (often in the context of making marketing messages more effective).  We have yet to find the part that makes humans conscious individuals instead of just complex biological machines, and such a part may not even exist.  We may very well be nothing but organic computers.\n\nIn other words, we have no firm idea of what consciousness is like in general, and until we do we have no hope of understanding what it's like for any specific creature.",

They pretty much lived in the moment, and while they were biologically the same as you or I, they lacked the ability to talk or anything like that. I think I remember reading about one of them who was eventually rehabilitated and when asked about what life was like before, during those feral years, described it as living in the moment, not being able to think like we do now.

Tap water is generally fairly basic, so unless you add lemon or some other acid to the pot, they'll nearly always change color. If the pot was really acidic, the water would change colors too, but it would end up being fairly red.",
                "_URL_0_\n\nThis deals with baking but it has some useful information.  Here is the part I think probably applies,\n\n*\"Carrots contain pigments that are sensitive to changes in pH balance. When the shreds of carrot come into contact with the alkaline baking soda, a chemical reaction takes place that causes the pigments to change color.\"*\n\nIf you just used tap water to cook the carrots, maybe you have hard water.  Perhaps it was the pan you cooked it in.  Some pans are reactive with certain foods.\n\nHope this helps.",

                "Many anthocyanins (some of which carrots contain) are also polyphenols and as such they may oxidate on contact with air, especially if there's polyphenol oxydase or catechol oxydase present. My theory is that their oxidated forms may react with reduced forms producing charge transfer complexes, which are usually colorful. Such a process causes the browning of apples, potatoes and bananas.\n\nI find the acid-base reaction hypothesis less plausible, as they are usually very fast and the effect would be visible immediately on contact with basic water. On the other hand redox reactions are often much slower and it might take some time before the effect is visible.",
                "This is really interesting, I'm not sure if I can figure out what is causing this. Probably need to do some experiments.\n\nBoiling water will help extract water-soluble pigments from the carrots. I think these are anthocyanins. But what is puzzling is the colour change over a course of a few hours.\n\nSome answers are suggesting that the pH in your tap water is high to begin with, so the carrot water changes colour. But if this were the case, dipping carrots in ammonia will turn them green -- not that I've tried this, but I'm pretty sure this does not happen. If it really did happen, I think we would have more kids doing chemistry experiments with carrots instead of boiling red cabbage to make indicator paper! In other words, if the carrots are responding to a high pH, it should be instantaneous, and not take place over the course of a few hours.\n\nThis points to another mechanism for the colour change. Suppose the chemical structure of those carrot pigments slowly changed over time. Say, they get oxidized. What would its structure be? I wasn't able to find anything on this. Maybe some other compound in the carrots helps this reaction along. But what might this be? I am skeptical of this mechanism because the boiling might have broken down these chemicals already.\n\nSo now, we turn to something else. What if, it's a reaction that involves some ions that result from the tap water and the boiling pot? Maybe these ions get incorporated into those pigments. But I'm not sure about this either. That's an awfully intense green colour you've got there. I can think of some ions that will do this, but I doubt they will be in the water.\n\nBottom line -- not sure of the reason. I'd like to see this repeated actually.\n\nOne piece of information that might be helpful is knowing the pH of the tap water. Try boiling chopped up red cabbage and see what colour it is. That will give us a rough estimate of what the pH is. We'll be able to compare with this picture on Wikipedia: [link](_URL_0_)."

They have gotten worse over the years; especially since I'm both near and far sided.

They'll still book a follow up sight test anyways as that's the rules over here, but it's useful to rule out tiredness, dry eye etc",

Using different plus and minus lenses, we are able to move the location at which light is being focused, giving you clear vision. \n\nThe automated machines, called an autorefractor, uses special images on the cornea, the clear part of the eye, to determine the lens that would be needed for the patient to have clear vision. Accuracy can be tough on these automated machines as optometrists do not want to give a patient whatever the machine says, as it can lead to overminus-ing or overplus-ing the patient, which can have negative impact on vision.

                "One thing is that nicotine and other drugs are designed to increase dopamine levels in the prefrontal cortex - this is not the area of the brain that experiences the dopaminergic declines associated with those who have Parkinson's Disease - their decreases in dopamine levels are primarily in the midbrain (near the substantia nigra).\n\nThat said, I wouldn't be surprised if nicotine's effects were non-selective. One should also examine the effects of other drugs (like ritalin) on Parkinson's too.",
                "It's my understanding that Parkinson's involves the actual death of neurons that produce dopamine. You won't bring those back by smoking cigarettes to release more. Even still, you can't limit this to the mere act of smoking cigarettes. Everything we do that has a reward to it is driven by the dopamine system. Not just cigarette smoking, but sex, eating, taking cocaine, so on. \n\nLastly, I am not a biochemist, but I believe that the way nicotine affects the brain is that it excites acetylcholine release and then inhibits its re-uptake. Additional acetylcholine in the brain would not help the balance of neurotransmitters. ",
                "Before I get to your actual question, let's start with one point. The risk of dying of lung cancer from smoking is 22.1% for a male, and 11% for a woman, approximately 20X higher than a non-smoker. The risk of Parkinson's Disease is 8 in 100,000 as a whole. So, let's assume that smoking has some positive effect in lowering the risk of PD. Trading off reducing the risk of PD by vastly increasing the risk of dying of lung cancer? Bad trade-off. [This study](_URL_0_) does seem to show a correlation between smoking and reducing Parkinson's risk. It does not show a reduction in symptoms once the disease strikes.\n\nAnd remember smoking does not just absolutely cause lung cancer. It vastly increases the risk of emphysema, cardiovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, and other cancers. [Read more.](_URL_1_)\n\nHowever, the problem with the assumption that smoking is a good anti-PD drug is multifold. First of all, it's trying to apply a specific pharmacologic effect with the worst possible drug delivery system ever. So, there is research to develop dopamine agonists with localized delivery that won't kill you like smoking. \n\nIf someone wants an excuse to smoke, they shouldn't use \"I'm preventing Parkinson's Disease\" as one of them. It's a horrible risk trade off. "

                "Difficult to say. Genetics are complicated; not all congenital diseases (that is, diseases you have from birth) are passed to offspring. As well, not all genetic diseases show obviously until much later in life, or maybe not at all (but can still be passed on to offspring). \n\nAt the end of the day, while a eugenics program may sound like a good idea, historically they've had some pretty bad results (like the Holocaust). Having kids is considered more or less a fundamental human right by a large portion of the population, hence why criminals and the mentally handicapped aren't sterilized (anymore). \n\nBasically, while there could be some health benefits to such a program, it would very rapidly become a political minefield. \n\nAlso, sidenote: genetic diseases are much, much, much more common, and also much harder to define, than you would think. Damn near everyone has a genetic predisposition to some diseases, so drawing the line between \"allowed to reproduce\" and \"not allowed\" would be very tricky. ",
                "In other words: \"Does eugenics works?\"\n\nThe nazis tried to test that but the got distracted kill jews and other people they considered \"unfit\".\n\nSince yhen we can't even touch the subject. \n\nBut I guess that it probably would work in some extent. \n\nThe problem is who to decides if some can or cannot reproduce and which criteria use.",
                "Obviously we could improve our collective genetics by filtering out unwanted traits, but 1. Many of these flaws are not hereditary so you can't breed them out and 2. Many people suffering from certain flaws weren't going to reproduce anyway (severe mental of physical handicaps for example). It would work, but there would still be a lot of conditions that couldn't be avoided because they are more or less random. The only way we could totally avoid genetic defects would be to step into the reproductive process and select only \"pure\" fetuses, or to manipulate the DNA.",
                "I don't think it would be good for the species overall. Maybe we could breed out a few genetic diseases, but we would also lose some of the genetic diversity that makes us resistant to other disease, for example, how sickle cell anemia makes some people resistant to malaria. It's difficult to know where to draw the line when genetic traits that are harmful in some environments can be advantageous in others. And the fact that trying to enforce a eugenics program on people would be far more damaging to human lives than disease. ",
                "Oh my sweet summer child.\n\nShort answer: Probably not.\n\nLonger answer: I mean, we might be able to tamper with genetics enough but we wouldn't want to.\n\nDetailed explanation...\n\nEvolution favors diversity. If you breed humans for a selective end, even if it seems like an obvious benefit, you hurt human ability to adapt in the future. Think of the Shih Tzu. This snub nosed runt has been bread so far apart from most dogs that its existence is dependent on humans. Its breeding is now too extreme and it would be incapable of survival if humans went away. Now, obviously, in your question we wouldn't tamper with humans to this extreme, but we would still be making humans a weaker species and one less equipped to meet a wide diversity of challenges. \n\nWhen it comes to physically/mentally disabled, blind, susceptible to disease you ignore one BIG thing... that shit still happens in nature. In environments where it's still expected for your cause of death to be being eaten, deaf, dumb, blind and gimpy critters are still born. You don't usually see them because, nature. These physical problems are mutations. They might not manifest right away, and they might not even become physical problems until the environment changes. Disease is separate from the general biological functionality. You cant breed out fetal alcohol syndrome, at best you could breed out pleasure from alcohol, but that in and of itself could have bad consequences. \n\nA good example of this the genetic predisposition for some disease. When all we had was nuts and berries, a subtle mutation which would make diabetes more likely didn't really pose a positive or negative until there was enough food for it to be a problem. Inversely, leprosy has all but been eliminated because it's almost killed everybody who's susceptible to the disease. Other problems, like macular degeneration, dependency on vitamins and aging are simply consequence of living and won't likely go away with heavy genetic modification.\n\nHumans breeds would make for an interesting experiment. Many people already falsely equate race to breeds but there simply isn't enough diversity for this to be equivocal. Full human breeding on this scale would look more like Eloi and Morlocks; the end product would take a long ass time and result in something only adapted to specific living conditions. Ultimately though, even if we ignore ethics/morality, there's a huge \"why would we do this?\" We could spend less and do more mapping human genetics and simulating multiple generations of change with a well designed computer model. Best yet, we wouldn't have to feed it. ",
                "As others have mentioned, you *might* be able to get rid of a few diseases, but you could increase the frequency of other problems by limiting the overall gene pool.  If you remove anyone with a genetic defect at each generation, the gene pool will become eventually become so sparse humanity could end up looking like [Charles II of Spain](_URL_0_).\n\nThe other thing that you wouldn't be able to control would be spontaneous mutation.  The human genome accumulates [1 - 2 new mutations per generation](_URL_1_), so you would still run into issues where a \"clean\" genetic line could become unusable after a time.\n\ntl;dr:  Hard to tell, but selective breeding in humans hasn't worked well in the past:  [Charles II of Spain](_URL_0_)",
                " > On the other side, humans if you can get someone to agree anyone can reproduce no matter the genetics. If we as a race opted to only let those with no physical problems, no disease and mental illness reproduce would we see a marked health in the human population as a whole or are outside factors (eating too much and getting adult onset diabetes, being exposed to viruses, etc) too prevalent a factor to prevent any marked change?\n\n\nThere's one huge problem with this: how do you know that those \"physical problems, diseases, and mental illnesses\" aren't actually a benefit?\n\nSickle-Cell anemia is a genetic disease that can cause serious problems for the people who have it; but it also provides resistence to malaria. ADD and ADHD are mental disorders that are huge advantages in certain professions. Autism spectrum disorders are also highly correlated with high levels of intelligence in specific areas. People who live with diseases are likely to have resistence to those diseases, either developed or genetic. The list goes on, and on, and on.\n\n\nBasically, what you would likely see is a short-term increase in human health, measured in 1-3 generations; followed by a significant decrease in average human health *and achievement* as the \"defects\" removed from the genetic diversity of humanity also took away certain advantages that came with them."

                "The terms duke and count come from Latin, and originate as military titles (dux and comes, respectively).  I know a lot more about the evolutional of ducal titles so I'll focus on that, but from the medieval period on they are functionally the same, just on a different scale.  In the late Imperial period, the title of dux was linked with a province, and signified the highest military authority in the province, eventually being able to act independently even of the governor of their province.  With the Germanic migrations and the erosion of the Roman empire, the Roman provinces at first largely retained their borders, and the titles continued to be used; Henri Pirenne, in Mohammed and Charlemagne, argues that the Germanic rulers saw themselves as a continuation, rather than replacement, of the Roman empire, even after their practical and official fealty to Rome ended.  The duces of Germanic western Europe were also landowners, and this, in combination with the military power they held by virtue of their title, meant that they soon became the de facto and then de jure authority over the land their title corresponded to.\n\nIn the early medieval period, the majority of nobles in Europe lived in the territories they held.  Over the next thousand or so years, the consolidation of titles by noble families, through marriage, bequethment by sovereigns, and military conquest, meant that one person could hold a collection of titles to lands theoretically all over Europe.  This caused a number of problems, a notable example being the Norman kings of England, who, having first held, and continuing to do so after the conquest, the title of Duke of Normandy, were legally vassals of the French king, a situation that lead to centuries of political and often military conflict.  Another result was that these nobles had to either choose one of their domains to rule from, or travel constantly between all their holdings.  In situations where this was not tenable in the longer term, many nobles would divide their distant holdings among a collection of heirs in their will, or bequeath some of their holdings to vassals to rule in their name during their own lifetime, so that they could be ruled by a lord residing locally, a situation that was noted later by Machiavelli in the Prince to contribute greatly to stability, and be much more likely to result in the continuation of control over that domain.  Another solution was to grant a family member the authority to rule a fief in the lord's name without transferring the title; this could be dangerous, as an ambitious and unscrupulous person could attempt to usurp that domain for themselves, or at least use their authority to enrich themselves while withholding the fruits of the fief from its titular lord.\n\nAs the Germanic kingdoms of Western Europe evolved, the kings, originally elected by the dukes from among their number, became hereditary.  At the same time, the system of feudalism was evolving into what we think of today when we hear the term.  A noble ruled a portion of a kingdom in the king's name, earning for themselves the bulk of the profits those lands produced, and in return, owed military service in the form of a certain number of soldiers for a certain period of time per year.\n\nHigher titles (duke was usually the highest title under the monarch, with count below that, and baron below that) usually came with larger fiefs, which were often divided into smaller domains; so, for instance, a duchy might be divided into a small collection of counties and baronies, with some of those counties possibly being partially made up of baronies themselves, and only a part of the land being directly under administration by the duke himself.  The less of their land the duke was directly responsible for, the easier it was to hold that domain in absentia, as subordinate lords who were present themselves could maintain stability within their own fiefs, and if they owed military service to their lord as part of their vassalage, be called upon to suppress any uprisings in the higher lord's own direct holdings.\n\nEven in the late medieval and into the early modern period, many lords resided in their holdings; the Sforza Dukes of Milan are examples.  In England though, most titles have become largely symbolic; the Prince of Wales, for instance, has been since the 13th century the title held by the English heir apparent.  As titles have lost their civic roles, the importance of residing in the associated fiefdom has completely disappeared.\n\nPlease forgive any spelling errors; I wrote this on a smartphone touchscreen.\n\nEdit: I always wondered back when I read those books, with all the intermarriages and houses being wiped out, how every lord held exactly one land-bearing title and no family had more than one branch.\n\nEdit 2: if I recall correctly, 'earl' is the English equivalent of continental 'count'.  Earl comes from Nordic jarl, a title used in Scandinavia, and by extension, in Britain during the Danelaw and the Viking domains in England, Scotland, and Ireland.  Perhaps someone else can elaborate on how earl came to be a subordinate title to duke, a title which gained its Germanic feudal connotations in Britain under the Normans."

                "In short answer, recent researchers has increasing found difficulty in defining the 'Hanseatic League' (OK for its use, I suppose) as a unified polity except for the relatively short period in late 14th and early 15th century, the 'Golden Age' of the Hanseatic League. Some revisionist scholars even argue that there was no 'Hanseatic League' until the middle of the 14th century, in contrast to the classic image of the early pioneering commercial activity of the German merchants in the Baltic Sea in the late 12th and 13th century. \n\nPart of this trend came from the revaluation of the central organization of the League, Hanseatic Diet (*Hansetag*): This was assemblies of the towns' representatives that could issued a shared regulations on the member towns as well as even could sometimes take an unified action against the possible external threat like the king of Denmark (1360s and 1410s), but the definition of this kind of membership itself was rather very ill-defined. There seemed to be no obligation for a town to send the representative in the Diet, so it is not so always easy to calculate how many towns actually joined in the League in a certain time like ca. 1450. According to a revisionist view of point, the Diet, i.e. the basic organization of the 'Hanseatic League' was anything but loose aggregates of towns under the influence of some leading towns like Lübeck (until 15th century) and Hamburg (16th century onward), based on the shared interest at that time. \n\nIn other words, taking this 'institutional' principle of the Hanseatic League in consideration, OP's original question means that: 'How independent were this kind of leading towns like Lübeck or Hamburg from HRE or other neighboring powers?' From this point of view, the middle of the 13th century (or 1220s/ 1230s) might be a turning point of 'Hanseatic' history when some towns like Lübeck began to act as an somewhat independent polity and to conclude a treaty with other territorial princes in Low countries or in Germany, or rulers of European kingdoms. AFAIK few HRE ruler had any concrete policy in the Baltic Sea in the Middle Ages, so generally they acted on their own until ca. 1500, I suppose.  \n\nReferences:  \n\n* Harreld, Donald J. *A Companion to the Hanseatic League.* Leiden: Brill, 2015. \n* Nicholas, David. *The Northern Lands: Germanic Europe, c. 1270-c. 1500*.

The company I bought the product from refused to do anything anout it or wouldn't even talk to me.\"  I won't do business with a company rhat makes me gamble on their product. Everyone makes mistakes, if refusing to fix them is part of your business model, then I'll take my money elsewhere.",

                "Humans rely mostly on their subconscious when making decisions under uncertainty. We use several subconscious strategies to do so: anchoring, availability/relevance and representativeness. In the case of shopping, relevance and representativeness are the main two. You want to know that an item will be useful in your life (relevance), and what others have to say that represents that item.\n\n\n\n These strategies are guided by our biases. Being a person who prefers not to lose (loss averse) appears to be the leading bias here. You are afraid of losing the resources from buying an item that ends up not being worth it. We are also social animals, who will follow the cues of other humans. Seeing a handful of people who \"lost\" with the product might deter a great amount of people from buying it, even if the statistical amount of people who got what they wanted was much greater. \n\n\n\nTo help solidify my point, doctors tend to word procedures in terms of success, rather than failure for this very reason. Do you think people would rather hear that a surgery has a 90% success rate? Or a 10% death rate? Getting someone to become more aware of the faults of something leans them towards their loss aversion bias, and negative reviews do just that. ",

                "A note to my readers: Given the nature of the text in question, there is sexually explicit material in my explanation.\n\nThe Victorians focused much more on the perceived Biblical connections of the Epic of Gilgamesh, and many Victorian-era translations either romanticized or skipped the sexual scenes completely. (I should note that I study the Victorian period, and my knowledge of Assyria, its culture, and its literature is hazy at best.)\n\nIn 1849, British archaeologist Austen Henry Layard and his assistant Hormuzd Rassam started excavating Nineveh. In 1853, Rassam excavated the palace of Ashurbanipal, finding thousands of fired clay tablets gathered by the king. Among them were the broken tablets that contained the Epic of Gilgamesh, but this wouldn't be discovered for decades. 1853 is also notable for being the year Sir Henry Rawlinson succeeded in deciphering cuneiform, using in large part a three-language inscription from Darius the Great known as the Behistun inscription. (An interesting and revealing side-story: Rawlinson describes having to balance ladders on very narrow lips of rock and then stand on the very top rung to copy down the text. When there was a passage the ladders could not reach and none of the British dared climb, Rawlinson did a very Victorian British thing: he hired a Kurdish boy to climb up, gripping with his fingers and toes, and take a rubbing, promising him \"a considerable reward if he succeeded.\") \n\nThe first person to translate a part of the Epic of Gilgamesh was a young British scholar named George Smith. Smith, who had left school at age 14 to work at a printer's, was fascinated by Assyria, and starting in 1860 visited the British Museum to learn all he could. When they noticed his obsession, the museum hired him to piece together the broken tablets, and it was he who first realized that some of the tablets contained the Gilgamesh epic. While working on the tablets, Smith discovered the story of the flood and the ship that ended up on a mountain and made a connection to the Biblical story. In 1872, he gave a talk to the museum in which he associated the flood story with Noah's flood, titling the talk \"The Chaldean History of the Flood.\" In the language used to write Gilgamesh, Akkadian often mixed with the older Sumerian, which Akkadian scribes also learned. A character pronounced one way in Akkadian would be pronounced entirely differently in Sumerian. This was why Smith's translation gave Gilgamesh's name as Izdubar (the latter would be the pronunciation if the symbols were Akkadian). Enkidu became Heabani. Smith argued that Gilgamesh is the hunter-king Nimrod who appears in the Bible. But what about all the sex that would surely have left Victorians outraged? There's no sign of it in Smith's early translation: at this point, he was only interested in Biblical connections. For example, of the whole incident with Ishtar and the monstrous bull, Smith only writes \"and then an animal called 'the divine bull' was subdued.\" He would also describe what he saw as the Assyrian depictions of heaven, hell, and the immortal soul. \n\nBut don't worry. In 1875, Smith published a much fuller version, *The Chaldean Account of Genesis,* which sold well. He purposely left out some of the more explicit scenes, such as Enkidu's (sorry... Heabani's) seduction by the \"temple harlot,\" claiming he did so \"because they were on the one side obscure, and on the other hand appeared hardly adapted for general reading.\" I can't think of a more Victorian dodge than that. There are also several errors in translation: instead of the famous wrestling scene between Gilgamesh and Enkidu, Izdubar wrestles a tiger Heabani brings with him, and Izdubar, not Heabani, is struck down by disease after they kill the giant bull, which makes Heabani's death something of a mystery. (The tiger is a mistranslation from text that had been written across two tablets: the \"Midannu\" beast turns out, when the tablets are connected, to be \"anakumi dannu,\" a boast by Enkidu: \"I alone am mighty.\") Smith also takes stories about Ishtar from other sources, including her descent into the underworld, using other Ishtar depictions to gloss over the defiant and scandalous ways Gilgamesh insults Ishtar as he rebuffs her sexual advances towards him. As you might imagine from Smith's framing, reviewers talked almost exclusively about the Biblical connections of Smith's translation, praising their usefulness in helping better understand Biblical stories.\n\nThe first popular translation was written by the fantastically-named  Leonidas Le Cenci Hamilton, an American, in 1884. His book, *Ishtar and Izdubar, The Epic of Babylon* turns the story into a sweet romance. Hamilton's adaptation is very loose, transforming the poem into couplets that are sometimes tortured into having the right end rhyme. In Hamilton's poem, Heabani chases the \"maiden\" sent to \"entice\" him, who playfully always slips out of his grasp: \"But he the sport enjoys, and her pursues; / But glancing back his arms she doth refuse.  /And thus three days and four of nights she played; / For of Heabani's love she was afraid. / Her joyous company doth him inspire / For Sam-kha, joy, and love, and wild desire. / He was not satisfied unless her form / Remained before him with her endless charm.\" Later, another maiden appears, and Heabani sits wistfully at her feet admiring her: \"And when Heabani saw the rounded form / Of bright Kharim-tu, her voluptuous charm / Drew him to her, and at her feet he sate / With wistful face, resigned to any fate.\" Regarding the scenes with Ishtar, the poem describes that her \"love\" for men and animals withers them away, but is vague on what that entails. Hamilton takes Ishtar's \"descent to Hades\" to return her lover Tammuz to life from a completely different poem (the \"Descent of Innana\"), and the connection to Greek mythology is clear. As for the death of Heabani, the seer receives his death-blow in a fight with dragons: even as Izdubar strikes down the dragon, the beast sinks its fangs into Heabani. After his long mourning for his friend, Izdubar finds sweet love in the arms of a princess, Mua. The story ends with Izdubar preparing to return from paradise to the world of men, making his tragic farewell to Mua, who chooses to remain ignorant of death in paradise rather than to come with him to a world of mortality and woe. In a second volume that was never written, Izdubar was supposed to eventually find immortality and reconcile with Ishtar. Interestingly, given the other translations around this time, Hamilton leaves out the flood completely. Hamilton's version was rendered obsolete almost immediately by more accurate and complete German translations. He was forced to file for bankruptcy, and died of stomach cancer in 1906. I haven't been able to find any contemporary reviews."

                "Let's put something real to this example. We'll choose Carbon-11. \n\nCarbon-11 is a radioactive isotope with a half life of 20 minutes. It decays by positron emission - that is, a proton is converted to a neutron and a positron is ejected from the nucleus. This converts the Carbon-11 to a much more stable Boron-11. So, if you sat and watched a 100 gram pile of Carbon-11 for roughly 5.5 hours, you would be left with only 0.001 grams of Carbon-11\n\nIt wouldn't \"disappear\", though. It is just converted to a different, more stable element. \n\n\n",
                "If we disregard the energy released during decay, then it depends on what the original and final atoms are.  If both exist in the solid phase at standard conditions, you wouldn't notice much.  If the product existed in the gaseous phase (like radon), then you would likely observe the original sample convert to a gas.\n\nHowever, *realistically*, a cubic meter of something decaying that fast is going to release an enormous amount of energy.  With a half life of 10 seconds, roughly 7% of the atoms present are decaying every second.  If we consider a [cubic meter of carbon 14](_URL_0_) (10^29 ) which emits 0.156 MeV per decay, at that decay rate your block would be putting out 2.5 x 10^15 watts (or roughly 400 times total human power consumption)."

That's ALL living things (people, fish, birds, trees, bacteria, flies, flowers, etc.)\n\nThe ocean contains approximately 1,450,000,000,000,000,000 tons of ocean water.  That's not 1.4 billion, or trillion, or quadrillion... but Quintillion.  1.45 Quintillion tons.  That's 1,450,000,000 billion.  That's so many orders of magnitute greater, that the amount of pee present is, to coin a phrase, \"A drop in the ocean\".\n\nSources:\n_URL_5_\n_URL_2_\n_URL_6_\n_URL_3_\n_URL_0_\n_URL_1_\n_URL_4_\n\nYAY OCEAN!\n\nEdit: moved to top level comment instead of reply\n\nEdit 2: Wow Thanks for the silver!\n\nEdit 3: WOW WOW Thanks SO much for the Gold!

Since air resistance isn't a factor you've made answering this easier. For the acceleration we'll use 2ms^(-2).\n\nSo is F=ma then force = mass x acceleration.\n\nLighter cyclist:\n\nF=ma\nF=50 x 2\nF=100N\n\nHeavier cyclist:\n\nF=ma\nF=100 x 2\nF=200N\n\nSo now that we have our force worked out we can carry on to complete the work done calculations.

Of course this only happens when both accelerations are exactly the same, which is unlikely.",
                "You are right in that the heavier cyclist would have performed twice the work against gravity, i.e. raised their gravitational potential energy twice as much (W = mgh). But the heavier cyclist would effectively do more work due to having to do more work against friction and drag. He also spends more energy pedalling as he has heavier legs.\n\n >  And what is the appropriate measurement for that? Watt hours?\n\nYou can measure work (and heat and energy) in many ways. Joule, Newton meters, Watt hours, Coulomb Volts etc. With mechanical work, such as cyclists riding up a hill, I would use Newton meters or Joule.\n\nEDIT: To reply to the most prominent follow-up comments:\n\n**you didn't account for the weight of the bicycle**\n\nI included the weight of the bicycle as well as the clothes, helmet and other carried items/accessories in the cyclist. If we only count the weight of the cyclist, the heavier one would do a little less work against gravity.\n\n**leg weight is not a factor**\n\nWhile leg weight doesn't contribute to any work against gravity. You do have to push with your legs to apply force to the pedals, and to make your legs move you have to overcome their inertia which is proportional to their mass.\n\nI cite an [example I made earlier](_URL_0_):\n\n >  Imagine if you are on a stationary exercise bicycle with no resistance and had to carry a certain amount of weight. If you carried that weight in a back pack it would make almost no difference, but if the weight were strapped on your feet it would make it harder to pedal as it would increase the inertia of your feet.\n",
                "The science above sounded correct, bit I'm just wondering : if they're on identical bikes, legs call them 10kgs, is it not 110kgs the fat guy has to get up the hill versus 60kg for the skinny guy? This not being 'double' at all? The hike has to get up too, and part of your force drives you and the bike as a system ",
                "If the problem is reduced to the ideal case - no air resistance, weightless bikes with frictionless drivetrains, inflexible wheels with no slippage, then yes, the heavier rider will have done twice the work.\n\nYou can see in all the other answers that there are a lot of other factors (air resistance, bike weight, tire flex, etc.) that can be added to the equation to get a more precise answer.",
                "A possibility that no one has mentioned here yet is that there is both:\n\n1. A point that the effort will be precisely equal to double\n\n2. A point that the effort will not be precisely equal to double.\n\nWithin the physical structure there can be many different amounts of 'effort' being placed with angles/weights/momentum of arms and legs. So let us assume that both cyclists are identical in everything except weight. Distributed identically.\n\nFor all sizes of rider (from microscopic to infinite) there exists a scale of how much effort is applied to the bike. There also exists a point on this scale that represents the most efficient power to weight ratio. \n\nIf you can place the weights of both riders equidistant on either side of that point of perfect ratio, then you could find exactly double the energy used.\n\nSo, do OP's 50kg and 100kg example weights represent this? Unknown, but also not really relevant. As there is also a selection of cycling styles (stand up, sit down, apply max on down pedal only, shift weight from foot to foot, etc...) that both cyclists can use. Even assuming identical styles, it stands to reason that 2 weights that do not produce double effort, could be made to by changing cycling styles as they manipulate acceleration, friction and inertia differently. And it is those physical forces that will mostly regulate the rates of changes near the point of exactly double effort. ",
                "Like many answers below, (assuming massless bicycles) the 100 kg cyclist will have created exactly twice as much potential energy by increasing the distance from the Earth's centrer of mass, but not exactly twice as much heat from air friction and air carrying away heat from their muscles.

With a rider weighing twice as much the difference is significant.\n\nThe difference in bearing and chain loss are very small.\n\nThe dominant factor is potential energy (mgh) so yes twice the energy but not exactly.",
                "The work output of the heavier rider will be 2x the lighter rider, however the work input is not necessarily the same ratio. The two riders are probably not equally efficient at converting stored energy into useful work. \n\nAnother way to think about it is to have two riders the same size on the same bikes. One rider is an elite cyclist the other rider is an amateur. \n\nThe elite cyclist will spend less energy to perform the same amount of work as the amateur because his trained body is more efficient at converting stored energy into work output. The total useful work done is the same, but the energy spent achieving that work is not the same. ",
                "You are correct in that the heavier rider will have to do double the work in terms of potial energy difference.  However the difference in power output would not be double because of the other sources of drag.  \n\nWhen riding a bike a very high percentage of the work being done is to overcome aerodynamic drag, on a flat road this can be as high as 80%.  So assuming that frontal area is the same, and things such as rolling resistance remain the same, and are relatively small.  The heavier rider would be doing 20% more work.\n\nObviously this is a very simplified case and I would need some paper to come up with a proper in depth answer but the idea is the same.  To measure the power use Watts (J/s) for work use Joules.\n\nTl:Dr: the work would not double because of larger sources of drag in the system ",
                "Not at all. You are forgetting that the mass of the bike is included in the problem. Let's say the bike is 10kg, then your two riders will have to increase the gravitational energy of them and the bike together, effectively working against 60kg and 110kg.\n\nThe other problem is resistance against the road, which is different from air resistance. Newton's 3rd law states that every action has an equal and opposite reaction (but be careful interpreting this). This means that when your bike is sitting on the road, it is applying a force to the road. The road applies **exactly the same force** back on the bike to stop it sinking into the road. This force is at right angles to the road (perpendicular), so it is also what is responsible for pushing you down the hill. It is called the Normal Reaction Force (becase normal and perpendicular are the same thing in maths). Friction can be simplified to a fraction of this force in the equation F = uR (the u is actually a greek letter), so this means that an object with a higher reaction force experiences more friction when moving along the surface. \"u\" is different for different surfaces.\n\nThe upshot of this is that your heavier rider will have more friction on the road.\n\nTo increase their potential energy, both riders will have to do work towards that energy, but will also be doing work against friction (which is lost as heat and sound). Calculating the work against friction is very simple. You take the frictional force \"F\" (from the equation earlier) and multiply it by the distance that force acted in (the distance your riders covered). From this you get the exact amount of energy required to overcome that force.\n\nSo in short, the heavier rider will do less than twice of the smaller to work against the weight of the bike, but more work than the smaller against friction.",
                "If we are talking about pure physics here, then yes, twice the weight equals twice the work (energy). It's easy to see from the potential energy formula many people provided here: E=mgh. There is only one extra condition that must be satisfied though: **both riders must be going with the same speed**. Otherwise, according to the kinetic energy formula K=mv^(2)/2 the faster rider will have to spend more energy.\n\nNow, if we are talking about human bodies, then the proportion is kind of skewed as a person's metabolic rate effects the outcome. According to many studies, heavier individuals spend more energy that lighter ones doing identical work, even laying down motionless (bodily functions as breathing, blood pumping, heat production, etc. take greater amount of energy for heavier bodies). So, I would assume that a real 100kg person would have to spend **more than twice the energy** of the 50kg one climbing uphill the same distance and with the same speed.     ",
                "The amount of work that the cyclists perform is not how hard they are working but the summation of the force exerted on the pedals over the distance the pedals turned. Our bodies exert more work to do work than we transfer. We burn calories and exert energy/work simply holding ourselves steady, balancing, etc.\n\nGiven that its the work transferred to the pedals what is the ration of the work the light cyclist did versus the heavy one? The bike obviously matters. Also lets assume they transfer work to potential energy of the hill at 70% each irrespective of the fact that the heavy rider is transferring more.  If both bikes are 10kgs the total mgh of each rider at the top of the hill is gh*(50+10) and gh*(100+10). As each rider only transferred 70% of their work to the hill the ration remains the same at 110/60.  The lighter rider had to pedal a proportionally heavier bike up the hill so the ratio is not 2:1\n\nOther factors are open to speculation but a heavy rider is not going to naturally be less aerodynamic or efficient at riding a bike than a light rider. ",
                "This is really easy. Work = Energy. In this case the energy changed is Potential. mass times acceleration times height since we are working with a change in gravitational potential energy.\n\nYou just take the mass of the bike rider and multiply by the acceration of gravity times the height of the hill (all in the same units.) It's not exactly double because you have to factor in the mass of the bike plus the rider. However if the bike is very very light compared to the rider you can ignore it and get a rough number. In this case, yes twice the work. However to be accurate you have to factor in the mass of the bike since it's probably about 10-15% of the rider weight. \n\nYou can also ignore all the other issues unless they are traveling at a speed where the air resistance starts to matter, but even assuming \"fat\" rider vs. a \"skinny\" rider, the difference in cross sectional area is also going to be very very small. Again, maybe 10%. When you factor in the speed at which they are riding it's irrelevent. At a slow speed the \"fat\" rider could have a parachute behind him and it would not make any difference. :-)",
                "This being the case the next question is: \"what factor(s) counter the advantages of lower body weight when cycling resulting in an optimum weight that is above the minimum weight possible for a live human?\". Bradley Wiggins is 77 kg"

Since there's only one right answer, the number of wrong answers is 2^n  - 1. Quantum mechanics can give you a \"state\" that's a \"superposition\" of the correct and all the wrong answers. Since there are so many more wrong answers, your chance of getting the right answer if you measure is extremely small. So we need to move the state closer to the right answer.\n\nNow consider a normal clock. Ignore everything between 3 and noon. 3 o clock is the wrong answers and noon is the right answer. Initially your state is almost all wrong answers and therefore very close to 3.  There's no way you're going to understand the math, but what you can do is the following:\n\nConsider where you start on the clock s. For simplicity let's say it's at 2.59 o clock. Now you can flip the state around the set of bad answers, which sets your state at 3.01 o clock. That seems to do you no good and just move you further away from the right answer. But it turns out you can flip back around s which gives you 2.57 o clock. Next round will be 2.57 - >  3.03 - >  2.51 and so on. After enough rounds you'll get close to noon. \n\nThere's a picture on wikipedia that shows it : _URL_0_\n\n|s' >  is all the wrong answers\n\n|w >  is the right answer.\n\n|s >  is the current state\n\nU_w is step one\n\nU_s is step two\n\nedit: If you didn't fully understand that, remember you're a highschool student and about half of students on 4th year of university manage to fuck it up.

                "Edit: Warning, you'll quickly see why my flair says \"Byzantine History\" and not \"Roman History\" !\n\nIt's because the Byzantine Empire was in some ways Roman, but other ways not at all. This is one of the ways that they were not. \n\nThe Early Roman Empire was more like a faux-republic (Think Russia or Francoist Spain). The institutions of the Republic mostly remained intact, Consuls and Quaestors were still appointed and the Senate still sat in their house and argued, and this is the case until Leo the Wise institutes the Basilika in the 9th century and removes most of the remaining Roman institutions. Alongside this, for a multitude of reasons, the early emperors didn't *want* to be looked at as Monarchs, Augustus refused to let people call him rex, for example, preferring the term \"Princeps\" which means first citizen. This doesn't really change until the reign of Septimius Severus and doesn't really go away completely until Diocletian institutes the Dominate and begins to peel away the false republic in favor of the de-facto Empire.\n\nSo why the laurels?\n\nThe Laurel you are referring to is the Civic Crown, or the second highest honor a Roman citizen could achieve. It was given to men who saved fellow citizens and as such it was truly a high honor. Augustus wanted to use this as his symbol, supposedly because it symbolized that he saved millions of people by ending the Civil Wars, and later emperors kept this tradition going. It was the symbol they could have to show their authority while keeping the visage of a republic alive.\n\nSo why did the Byzantines stop this?\n\nA variety of reasons, basically. For one, as I mentioned above, the fake republic continuously eroded until it was a mere sham. The Senate stopped doing anything really, the title of Consul became united with that of Emperor under Leo the Wise, Roman government titles were replaced with Greek ones, etc. With these institutional legacies dying off, there's less of an impetus to abide by the customs of a republic that was long dead.  The Eastern people also were just generally much more accepting of monarchal rule than the Romans. An often understated aspect of Byzantine governance is how much eastern traditions were infused with Roman ones to make the \"Byzantine\" Empire. Political mutilations would have been looked as appalling under the classical Romans, while in Byzantium it was the expected punishment of basically anyone who opposed the government in some way if they weren't just straight up executed. Visitors of the Emperor were expected to fully prostrate themselves and kiss the ground, while prior the \"First Citizen,\" would either expect nothing like this or accept a mere bow. These two factors together are what allowed the Emperors of Byzantium to fully announce themselves as \"Emperors.\" Symbolically you see this with the fact that Heraclius stopped using the title of Caesar (which eventually became a high court title, not the Emperors title) or Augustus (although it's part of the name of a few more of his descendants, the first guy I can't find any evidence of being Augustus is Constantine IV, his great grandson), but instead using the title of \"Basilius,\" which translates to \"Sovereign\" in Greek but is generally recognized as meaning \"Emperor.\" Alongside all of this, however, was the removal of any disgust at the idea of wearing a crown. Justinian and Theodora both wear one in their famous mosaics in Ravenna, many of the Eastern Roman Emperors of antiquity (at least I think, I can't see clearly enough in the pictures if they're Laurels or Crowns, but Theodosius I and his son Arcadius both appear to be wearing crowns) wore crowns in depictions and in coins, and the Byzantines eventually actually got quite good at making them! The famous crown of St. Stephen (which is unfortunate in that it depicts the evil nitwit (light hearted sarcasm) Michael VII) is a Byzantine Crown and the potentially fraudulent Monamachos Crown (Which depicts sisters Zoe and Theodora, Daghters of Constantine VIII, Nieces of Basil II and the last legitimate Macedonians, and Zoe's husband Constnatine IX Monamachos).\n\nSo, for short, the Romans didn't wear them because they preferred to keep up the false Republic, while the Byzantines didn't care and quite enjoyed their gold.

                "The brake system in a car works on hydraulic pressure. If the brake line is cut all the fluid leaks out and there is no pressure to apply to the brakes. At best you could coast down in neutral to stop, but you would need a hill to decelerate rapidly. The friction of the pads on the rotors assists in slowing the car down, but eventually the car would stop. In a real emergency just throw the car in park. You’ll kill the transmission but the car will stop. ",
                "So there are a few things in place to avoid flying off a cliff if a line is cut. First, with one line cut at one wheel, you would still have some brake effort in two other wheels since there are generally two separate hydraulic circuits that control all 4 wheels. \n\nThen you have the transmission to help assist in slowing down. Automatics allow for down shifting through the manual gears by shifting into the \"L\" or numbered gears. These gears give you engine braking where \"D\" does not. Engine braking is when you let off the gas and transmission does not allow freewheeling so the resistance from the wheels actually slows the car.  Do not throw the car in park. The parking pawl is a relatively small piece of metal and will just snap off if your at speed and just go to park. \n\nThis brings us to the parking brake (or e-brake as some call it). Parking brakes are either cable or electrically controlled and are not part of the hydraulic brake system. The parking brake will work, but it only applies the rear brakes. If you lost all the hydraulic brakes, you would want to apply and release the parking brake in conjunction with down shifting to slow the vehicle to a stop. You dont want to lock up the rear wheels while driving as your car becomes incredibly hard to control with two wheels in a dead skid. \n\nLastly, a person can use the steering wheel to stay on the road or ride in the shoulder to help slow the car. So it doesnt have to end like it does in the movies. ",
                "Imagine trying to unscrew a bolt that is stuck, and you have two wrenches, one is made of metal, and the other is made of rubber. When using the metal wrench, all of the force put into pulling on the lever, is mostly transferred to twisting the bolt. The metal wrench actually bends a little, but not enough to prevent turning the bolt. But a rubber wrench would not transfer the energy of pulling it's lever very well. Instead of transferring that energy to the bolt, the wrench will bend, and that force is wasted bending the wrench. So in order to transfer energy, you need most of the work you do, to make it to the other end of the wrench. The same is true in a hydraulic system. \n\nFluids do not compress very well, you can basically say they don't compress. All of the force of a brake cylinder pressing down, is transferred (minus friction losses) to the brake caliper cylinder on the other end. \n\nWhen a hydraulic system has air in the line, or the fluid leaks out due to a puncture, it is replaced by air, which is compressible. When the brake cylinder is compressed by the pedal, instead of transferring that force to the brake shoe caliper, it goes into compressing the air/gas bubbles in the line, and the braking force is considerably less. More of the work done at one end of the system is wasted and doesn't make it to the other end. \n\nWhen enough fluid leaks out of the system, none of the energy makes it through at all, because there is no longer any pressure. In the rubber wrench analogy it would be like the wrench breaking, and none of the energy making it to the bolt. "

                "Through out the republican and imperial periods of Roman history, important figures like consuls, generals, senators, and later emperors were issued with official types of their portraiture. This consisted of an approved (by some authority, whether the artist or subject or both is contested) bust of their head. So all statues of them would use replicas of their head to have a standard look that people could recognise. The Prima Porta type is the most famous for the emperor Augustus(I was just looking at the eponymous statue of the type yesterday in Oxford's Ashmoleon for a paper I'm writing) and would probably be recognisable to people familiar with Augustus as it has over 140 replicas still in existence. The types could change over time and are not seen as perfect examples of what they looked like although in most cases we'll never know, but we are sure of the level at which this affected the mass conception of how people thought their rulers looked. Similar forms were also used on coinage that was minted by senators and emperors which were far more widespread than any statue and handed over far and wide. \n\nAfter Rome fell the level of recognisability fell greatly as the level of centralisation required for mass produced images simply was was not reached again for centuries in the west. In the east imperial images of emperors and the like was a bit more centralised but I am unaware of the specifics and how widespread images were as I am not an expert in that field unfortunately. \n\nHope I helped, keep learning ",

                "In the high to late middle ages at least, how important people dressed seems to have been how people could tell who was who. This starts on a bigger scale-- entire people groups could be told apart by how they dressed. Peasants wore, well, what you tend to picture when you think of a medieval peasant, and as you went further up the social ladder, people wore more expensive garments made with pricier exotic dyes like reds and purples, while the clergy had vestiments to show who they were, monks wore their hair tonsured, etc. In fact, in the late middle ages when wages were spiking and more people could afford more luxury goods, middle classmen were dressing like the nobility, and that became such a problem that they outlawed dressing outside your social stratum. These were called sumptuary laws, if you want to do more research there.\n\nWhen it comes to individuals, yes, it's more difficult. Public appearances for lords and kings were important, but in the relatively small communities medieval cities were (compared to today), it wouldn't take much thinking to recognize, say, the local lord or the king. Individual knights were an interesting case. Literature suggests that wealthy/famous knights had very distinct armor to identify themselves by. In Malory's Morte d'artur, Lancelot steals Kay's armor and impersonates him for a while, before people recognize his fighting style and know it couldn't be anyone but Lancelot. A coat of arms was also essential, because heraldry was propaganda. Individuals would have a private coat of arms, so if you saw a certain pattern and had a good eye, you could spot Henry Bolingbroke all the way across a tourney field, for example. Every now and then we see a manuscript illumination with figures clearly depicted with consistency, but this would have been more for the sake of long-term prestige, getting immortalized in text, because the general public didn't have general access to those posh manuscripts."

                "In short- Yes!\n\n\nCurrently we view Cuba as a \"we don't really go there\" country, but pre-revolution, it was considered to be a common vacation spot.  It's proximity to the US made it an easy destination travel, and was kind of a \"Vegas before there was Vegas\", with the added benefit of beaches, etc.\n\nBefore the revolution, the Cuban government (under Batista) gave foreign nationals very lucrative terms if they would buy and develop properties.  The Mafia saw this as a way to build casinos at a fairly cheap cost, with the additional benefit of a friendly government that would less likely regulate them out of existence.  From a practical perspective, this involved suitcases full of cash being donated to government officials, to get them to sign off on contracts, look the other way, etc. \n\nComing to the revolution, the common man in Cuba began to see the alliance between the government and the Mafia as a basic wholesale looting of the country.  While some people got casino jobs, the truth was most people just saw the money flowing up and out.",
                "Yes, American mobsters did have substantial investments in Cuba.\n\nFirst a note on terminology. Following [Joseph Albini](_URL_1_), I’ll say that it’s wise to focus on the mob not as an organization, but as a system of relationships. While it was indeed “organized: crime, it wasn’t necessarily as well-defined and rigidly hierarchical as, say the Coca-Cola company or the New York Police Department. It’s more a loosely organized group of operators who have sometimes-complimentary investments in a variety of operations, rather than a cohesive corporation that wholly owns its subsidiaries. Mob bosses and associates invested their own money and looked out for their interests, rather than managing the capital and operations of an independent corporate entity.\n\nSo I wouldn’t say “mafias” had interests in Cuba. Rather, I would say that individuals alleged to be members of the Mafia, or La Cosa Nostra, had substantial interests there. Mobsters’ many connections to Cuba were fictionalized in *The Godfather 2*, with Hyman Roth standing in for real-life mob financier Meyer Lansky. Lansky’s investment in Havana’s Riviera hotel (and casino) were sufficient that his heirs have [pressed the Cuban government for compensation](_URL_0_), due to the nationalization of the Riviera after the communist takeover.\n\nInvesting in Havana was consistent with the investment patterns of American illegal gambling operators going back to the mid-19th century. Traditionally, most operations were owned by syndicates of investors, with the major shareholder usually serving as on-site manager (source is my own [Roll the Bones: The History of Gambling](_URL_2_)). When a single illicit casino might be forced to shut down due to government pressure or an actual raid, it made sense to diversify one’s holdings. So you had John Morrissey owning faro houses in both New York City and Saratoga Springs and, later, Richard Canfield having interests through the New England and New York areas. Lansky raised this to an art form, with interests in various enterprises throughout the United States and Caribbean.\n\nSome evidence of the scope of American gambling interests in Havana is that the city entered the public consciousness as a place for Americans who liked gambling to visit. For example, at the end of *Guys and Dolls* (film 1955, Broadway play 1950, based on Damon Ruynon stories of the 1920s/1930s), Sky Masterson takes Sarah Brown to dinner in Havana, Cuba—implying that degenerate gamblers like Masterson and Nathan Detroit would be familiar enough with that town to know of the restaurants there, and they wouldn’t just be attracted by the climate. Ten years later, the dinner would probably be in Las Vegas."

                "Every defense mechanism has false positives (for example, when you body attacks itself, like in an auto-immune disorder) and false negatives (for example, when your body doesn't attack a pathogen).\n\nVarious parasites have the advantage of having had millions of years to evolve their evasive mechanisms and their defense mechanisms to avoid detection or mitigate attacks by human immune systems. ",
                "All human's, aside from identical twins, have a different mix of unique markers that allow for the recognition of self and nonself. The most important is the Major Histocompatibility Complex or MHC. Nearly every cell in your body expresses MHC which is loaded with a little bit of protein called a peptide. These peptides can come from self and from pathogens. An individual's T cells are designed to react to cells that express an MHC that binds unusually strongly. During T cell development, T cells selected that they won't bind self MHC with self peptide. Foreign tissue like transplanted organs express MHC that your T cells will bind strongly which causes the T cell to kill the foreign tissue through activation of cytotoxic T cells which punch holes in the transplanted organ and macrophages that will eat it.\n\nOur organs never evolved survival mechanisms to evade the immune systems whereas many parasites have. The type of immune response I described above is what is called a Th1 or cell mediate response. Th2 and humoral responses are used against parasites. Because parasites are so large, our body is more focused on controlling it than killing it which could damage the infected tissue. Your body does produced antibodies against the parasite that can cover it which leads to cells like eosinophils degranulating toxins on the parasite but because parasites have many life stages it is often difficult to mount an antibody response against multiple forms of the parasite.\n\nTLDR: Transplanted organs are an easy target that doesn't try to protect itself while your body doesn't want to cause damage by destroying parasites\n\nSource: Immunology Graduate Student. Janeway's Immunobiology is a great textbook",
                "Transplanted organs are screened for MHC allotypes before transplantation. MHC molecules are the proteins our cells make that display antigens to other immune cells...like T cells. Our immune system is designed to be \"tolerant\" to our own MHC allotypes. However, when foreign tissue express different MHC, our immune system recognizes it as foreign and attacks it. \n\nWe do have defense against helminthic worms and parasites. IgE antibodies, mast cells, basophils, and eosinophils coordinate to release toxins that can kill these pathogens. However some of these have developed great ways of eluding our immune system. Interestingly enough, since parasites aren't typically a problem in first world countries, the normal defense mechanisms target non virulent substances like pollen and animal dander resulting in the development of allergic reactions.",
                "A large part of the immune system is dedicated to secrete antibodies from mucus membranes that are designed to specifically target parasite antigens.  However, due to our generally parasite-free 1st world lifestyle, those antibodies frequently target other antigens, and result in allergies.",
                "I think one simpler explanation that may be overlooked is that organs  don't have defenses while parasites etc do. An organ (that is, it's constituent cells) expects to be welcome in the body and takes no measures to protect itself from the body's defenses; it is designed to be part of what is being defended.\n\nAn organ that reads as foreign will be attacked by the same defenses as a parasite... but the parasite has tools to fend off the defenders and the organ does not.",
                "As others have mentioned, parasites are very well-adapted to living inside host organisms. I wanted to call attention to one specific parasite, *Trypanosoma brucei*, which causes African Sleeping Sickness. 6-10% of *T. brucei* genome is dedicated to different Variable Surface Glycoproteins (VSGs), which help the organisms evade detection by the host's immune system. Only one of these VSGs is expressed on any individual *T. brucei*, but having thousands of variations allows the parasites to persist in the body. When the immune system begins to recognize and destroy the *T. brucei* with one VSG variant, the parasite load decreases for a time until the surviving parasites of a different VSG variant are able to replicate undetected.\n\nOnly one of the examples of why the human immune system has trouble with parasites, but I've always found it very interesting.",
                "Everything has antigens (targets) which mark it. The purpose of our immune system is to differentiate self antigens from foreign antigens, and go open a can of whoop ass on anything with foreign ones. When you get a donated organ your body recognizes the antigens on them as foreign and is like, \"da fuq iz dis shit?!\" and says, \"see that thing with the not us antigen/target on it? go fuck it up!\" and you develop and immune response against it. To side step this we try to match recipients with donors that have the same antigen profiles, so organ targets that are similar to what's already in your body, that way your immune system will see this new shiny kidney with its antigens and think, \"oh, this new kidney has the same antigens on it (because it's from dude's twin brother) as are over on homie's liver, that's supposed to be here. Life is good, no stress\". Issues come up when donor targets are different from the recipient's and the immune system realizes there's something foreign inside that \"shouldn't\" be there. We give immunosuppressive drugs to recipients so that even when their body recognizes this foreign thing, it's not able to mount a response to get rid of it. The effectiveness of this varies.\n\nWhy can't the body get rid of things like parasites or certain bacteria? There are a ton of different mechanisms by which they avoid death. We can call these things \"virulence factors\", so the methods by which they outsmart our immune systems (and otherwise cause us trouble). 2 examples:\n\n**Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)**: This little fucker displays antigen/target \"instability\". Because it has such a shitty spell check on its genetic material it is constantly changing which antigens it makes. Thus the body finds a target on the virus and be all lyke, \"Bros, dis bitch b wearing a purple wig, go fuck up NEthing wearing a purple Mohawk wig!\" but then HCV stops wearing a purple wig and dawns a blue mullet wig, and the body isn't able to keep up with these antigen/outfit changes and never really finds or properly destroys the virus.\n\n**Staphylococcus aureus/\"staph\"**: This cocksucker does a bunch of ratchet ass shit. One bullshit thing it does is use something called Protein A. Remember those little Y shaped things from biology called [antibodies](_URL_0_)? The branched parts/variable region identify and attach on to enemy antigens, like the foreign organ or a unique protein on a bacteria. The base of the Y, the constant region, is picked up by our immune cells, therefore directing them to fuck up the bad guy on the other end of the antibody. Protein A is on staph, and actually grabs onto the constant region, the part that our defense cells are supposed to latch onto, and make the antigen targeting part of the antibody face away from any of the antigens. Imagine if you wanted to stop your idiot room mate from making burned ass hole on the stove so while he's trying to cook, you grab the flat part of his spatula. You are now staph and your hand covering the effective part of the spatula is Protein A, making the spatula/antibody useless to do [it's only job](_URL_1_). Thus, our defense cells can't use the antibodies to raise hell.\n\nThere are a shit ton of things that worms, viruses, bacteria, etc. do to avoid the immune system, so, it's not really one answer, but those are two. ",
                "The simplest answer is that it tries to kill the parasites, but isn't always successful.\n\nThink of this: parasites (by which I assume you mean helminths, or parasitic worms) have evolved alongside us for millions of years, and so they've evolved mechanisms to avoid the immune system.  Some of them suppress the immune system, some of them coat themselves in our proteins as a sort of camouflage, and some hide in places our immune system can't see them.  There's no selective advantage to having human organs evade the immune system of another human, so that never evolved.",
                "In a human body, every cell has MHC I it acts like an ID tag for the TSA (immune cells to check upon) if you do not have the MHC I match then the immunity response occurs. Parasites and other pathogens have complicated evasive methods to stimulate an MHC I receptor. Fun fact, bone marrow can attack the human body not the other way around. ",
                "Every cell in our body has a molecule called MHC-I (major histocompatibility complex class-I) expressed on it. In the steady state, proteins from within the cell are broken into peptides (small fragments of proteins) and these peptides are loaded onto MHC-I and exported to the cell surface. This gives an antigenic barcode if you will, of all the peptides within a cell, and therefore an organ (and whole body). Our immune system remains in a tolerogenic state to \"self antigens\" but will however recognise \"foreign, or non-self\" antigens displayed on MHC-I, such as those from a foreign organ.\n\nRemoval of MHC-I from the surface of an organ won't allow the organ to be ignored because cells called natural killer (NK cells) recognise the absence of MHC and will destroy the cells.\n\nWorms avoid detection by 3 main mechanisms. Firstly, some worms have a sheath that they will shed upon entry into the host. The sheath will contain the major antigens that would otherwise facilitate recognition. Without this sheath, the worm can go into stealth mode. Now that it is in stealth mode, the worm can burrow into the linings of the GI tract. This causes lots of damage and the natural reaction for the body is to form a granuloma. Granuloma formation effectively blocks the immune system from effectively getting access to the worm and having a go at destroying it. Think about trying to kill a giant within a fortified castle - similar case here. Thirdly, worms have a specific lifecycle. The antigens expressed on the eggs, larvae and adult worms can all be different and so the immune system is trying to hit a moving target.\n\nHope this helps!",
                "I'm surprised to not see a more detailed answer to this so far, so here goes:\nBoth parasites (and cancer cells) exploit systems your body has in place to turn off the immune system. For every time you mount and immune attack, there are counteracting pathways that try to turn off that attack so you don't harm anything that isn't supposed to be harmed. In general, this proceeds through regulatory T cells coming in and suppressing the immune response. Both worms and cancers turn on regulatory T cells to tune down the immune system. Here is a review: _URL_1_\nOrgans do not have this capability, because they didn't have a need to defend from the immune system where they were growing. They also possess antigens on their surface (like worms and cancer) that the immune system wants to destroy. If we strip these antigens off, you can even transplant organs from a pig to a human. \n_URL_0_",
                "It does kill parasites and worms, but parasites and worms tend to fight back.  Transplanted organs do not.",
                "Parasites are sneaky.  They're designed to infiltrate, survive and breed in inhospitable environments, like a digestive track or stomach acid.\n\nYour new liver is designed to work hand in hand with your body, not to evade its immune system.",
                "If you think about it evolutionarily, viruses and other pathogens have evolved to evade the human immune system, as this is a necessity of their survival. Transplanted organs, on the other hand, retain the genetic imprint of the donor, and any cell-surface markers that are not recognized as self-antigens by the recipients immune system will be destroyed.",
                "Aren't worms living in intestines, for purposes of the immune system, outside your body? Most things you eat don't trigger inflammation, white cells etc. when you eat them, but would if transplanted into the body. The defense is to not let them into the bloodstream and maybe try to flush them out. ",
                "Some parasitic worms also have variant surface glycoproteins that change the proteins expressed on the surface of the worm. These changes occur cyclically and in the time it takes the body to recognize the new surface protein the parasite has already multiplied. Plasmodium falciparum (malaria) uses this defense mechanism and, as you can tell by mortality rates in affected areas, it's a very effective way to fool the host immune system. ",
                "The human body actually tries to do both. The thing about parasites is that many of them have defense mechanisms of their own. Many intestinal worms for example secrete substances that suppress your immune system. More specifically they secrete substances that suppress Eosinophils that normally are responsible for protecting the body from parasites (and are responsible for allergic reactions). The secretions are not unlike antihistamines in nature, although there is quite a bit more to it then that. ",
                "Great questions and answers. I'll add: the defense mechanisms-or some of the ways that these bugs have evolved to avoid the wrath of the immune system is what makes them so fantastically creepy. For example, the bacteria Staph aureus can cause superficial and deep skin infections, food poisoning and toxic shock syndrome. It avoids host defenses by having  a capsule, having a protein that binds the business end of immunoglobulins rendering them non-immunogenic and a having toxin that actually fights some of the host's white blood cells. Some worms and parasites will elaborate molecules that disturb the normal inflammatory response of the host to protect themselves. Some will activate T-regulatory cells-which usually allow for tolerance to self-antigens, and essentially use those cells to make the host tolerate them as well. \n\nTL; DR They have weapons and shields and recruit the host's soldiers to their team.  \n\n",
                "Detailed Answer:\n\nMHC cell surface receptors, which are very diverse through out our population, are easily recognized as non-self and cause a huge immune response. This is what is recognized as foreign and causes Natural Killer cells and CD8+ T cells to be activated (CD8 + T cells require TH1 cells cytokine and co stimulation signals) and respond by destroying these foreign cells via release of granules or via FAS/FASL.\n\nExtra cellular pathogens have a number of defense mechanisms like neutralizing radical oxygen species (Catalase), incorporating host membrane components containing things like MHC molecules / anti complement molecules like DAF and CD59 (tricks immune system into thinking pathogen is self), slime layers that act like a barrier to prevent immune cells from interacting with the pathogen, and ETC.  ",
                "When your body is developing new immune cells in the bones and lymph nodes, they are subjected to continuous interactions with \"Self\" antigens. This occurs as lymphocytes develop under the direction of a larger cell, such as a dendritic cell in the lymph nodes. These cells display HLA antigens associated with host cells. Lymphocytes have two main objectives: Identify and protect \"Self\" or host cells and attack foreign cells. If a developing lymphocyte produces a receptor or antibody that targets these self antigens for attack, they are induced to undergo programmed cell death. More specifically there are HLA Antigens that nearly all host cells display to identify them as \"Self\" to active lymphocytes. Active lymphocytes are continuously patrolling their environment, transiently attaching to host cells they come into contact with. So immune cells don't only interact with foreign cells, they are constantly interacting with cells in our body to give the \"all clear.\" When transplanting organs, the goal is to find a donor whose HLA antigens most closely matches those of the recipient. When there is a mismatch of the HLA type, the transplant may be rejected by the host's immune system due to the binding of lymphocytes to the foreign HLA sequence and initiating an attack on those foreign cells. To avoid this fate, transplant recipients are often given immunosuppressant drugs which decrease the immune response to all foreign cell types, including pathogens.\nThere are two reasons that parasites escape detection. Firstly, parasites are often not located in the aqueous humor where a vast majority of lymphocytes are circulating and are thusly not subjected to the same type of survailance as transpanted tissues would experience. Second, there is only a limited type of lymphocytes that occupy the environments in which parasites thrive and these cells must have antigenic specificity for cell surface markers displayed by the parasites. These antigenic specificities are developed through a complex process involving genetic rearrangement to specific genes that develops the antigenic specificity of the antibodies or receptors produced by the lymphocyte. For instance, if the parasite was located in the intestines, only a handful of lymphocytes would interact with the parasite and if none of the lymphocytes has a receptor/antibody specific for a cell surface identifier on the parasite then the parasite would go completely unnoticed.\n\nI am a bit rusty on my immunology so don't take my word as absolute, but generally this is my understanding.",
                "I think a lot of people have thoroughly covered transplant rejection, but I think that more could be said of parasites.\n\nOne thing about parasites is that they have evolved their own complex microbial systems to avoid detection. Often they use defenses, like anticoagulants in their saliva, to keep your immune system from rejecting them. And even when your body does reject them, and you start getting puss, and other body mechanisms to fight infections, it may not necessarily kill the parasite.\n\nAnd some parasites form a symbiotic relationship with their hosts as well. Typically symbiosis is a mutually beneficial arrangement, but not always. Parasites may adapt to thrive in a certain environment, e.g. the human body, by evolving. And sometimes may even give back something beneficial to the host to form a symbiosis.\n\nMany parasites are also specifically adapted to a particular host. There are cases where you find only certain parasites on certain hosts, because they have completely adapted their lifecycle around that particular host. When parasites adapt to multiple hosts that's when you get the negative side effect of disease spreading interspecies as well. Such as when a mosquito bites a bat, or rodent, and then bites a human and shares whatever it picked up from the other animal.\n\nAnd when you consider that just the human gut is filled with microbes with their own, distinct, non-human, DNA you begin to realize that what you call \"you\" isn't quite just, well, you. While most of these microbes exist in a beneficial symbiotic relationship (gut microbes help aid in digestion) there are some that are harmful to us as well. The ones that are more harmful are usually classified as parasites.",
                "Simple answer: The human body actually does *try* to kill parasites like worms. You actually have a couple immune cells specially tailored to fighting big parasites like worms. The problem is that worms have evolved to avoid and resist our immune systems, while an organ from another person has no such protection. Get rid of a worm's protection, and it would get attacked all the same."

                "Follow up question. With the literacy gap in the country at the time, as a consideration, can these turnout numbers really be trusted?",
                "Although I'll swing back to the circumstances around 1876, to start off, I'm going to turn this question on its head and look at why voter turnout *declined* in the elections following. If you look at [this chart](_URL_0_) you can see that while 1876 was the highpoint, it wasn't exactly an anomaly, and voter turnout was consistently high in the elections preceding it. It sticks out because, although the drop wasn't *immediately* afterwards, it certainly preceded the continuing decline in voter turnout that would mark the next half-century.\n\nSo why did voting decline in that period? Well, one of the most simple reasons to look at is Jim Crow. While under Reconstruction, black men (women being generally deprived of the vote) could, for the most part, go to the polls and exercise their right to vote, this began to change after Reconstruction was ended (not to say it didn't happen before, just not as effectively), and the Redeemer governments worked through various means to disenfranchise vast swathes of voters in the American South. The effect of this can't be underrated. While in the 1876 election the South saw turnout roughly comparable to the rest of the country, at 75 percent, vote suppression methods such as literacy tests not to mention outright fraud, saw the turnout decline to 46 percent at the turn of the century. By the 1924 election, *19 percent* of those theoretically eligible to vote were actually showing up at the polls. And to be sure, while the primary target was black voters, many poorer, illiterate whites were disenfranchised too, despite \"loopholes\" to grandfather many of them in. In Louisiana, for instance, while 90 percent of black voters were barred from the polls, 60 percent of whites were as well. While Jim Crow should absolutely be understood as primarily a racial regime, it was quite oligarchical as well, with power being concentrated in the hands mostly of upper-class whites, who wanted to share it with no one.\n\nThis allows us to circle back somewhat though to look at 1876, and why it would be slightly above the average of the time though. During the Reconstruction era there were *real efforts* to mobilize poor voters of both races by the Radical Republicans. The example I'm most familiar with was that led by Mahone in Virginia whose Readjuster movement controlled the state for a brief time in the late 1870s-early'80s, propelled by populist support from a coalition of black voters and poor whites. I won't spend to much time on him as I've written about him before [here](_URL_1_) but the short of it is that in the post-war era, but before Jim Crow laws took hold, we can see a lot of political agitation that struck at the white Democratic establishment in the South that was attempting to reclaim power, and that *for a time* they enjoyed some successes. The 1876 election in particular we can look at as a watershed, with both sides of the argument over Reconstruction seeing heavy stakes. And of course Tilden won the popular vote, but lost anyways, as part of a deal that did end Reconstruction anyways. That cessation meant the evaporation of the Federal protections that allowed those insurgent political movements to compete on a roughly level playing field. Changes weren't immediate, and varied state by state - in Virginia for instance the Readjusters remained in power until 1883, when race riots days before the election were used by the Democrats to stoke voter fears - but it nevertheless meant that the suppression of the black vote and the poor white vote was able to start, a process which wasn't immediate, and took time to take full effect.\n\nIt can also be said that while Jim Crow was unique to the American South, similar political tactics were not unknown throughout the country, just in different ways. In the Northern and Western states, turnout had dropped to 55 percent by the 1920 election, after all, and while it cannot be blamed on *institutional* barriers such as those in the South, responses to political mobilization by immigrants and lower-class groups *outside* the South by political elites saw attempts at \"demobilizing what they judged to be the least desirable components of the electorate\". They may not have been legally barring them from the polls, but through the late 1800s and early 20th century, they certainly were attempting to dissuade them from showing up.\n\nSo as I have tickets for Thor at 10, and my wife is giving me *the look*, I'll wrap this up with a quick summation. In short, voter turnout in the United States was consistently fairly high up until the 1880s. The apex of turnout in 1876 isn't exactly an anomaly if we look at the turnouts in votes around it, such as 1868 at 78.1%, or 1880 at 79.4%, but it does coincide with a period in American history rife with political upheaval, not just the American South, still on the tail end of Reconstruction, but nationwide, with Populist movements in the ascendant. The end of the century, and the early 1900s, thus provide a stark contrast, as attempts both at institutional vote suppression, as well as simple 'demobilization' of cohorts of voters, lead to a decline in turnout nationwide.\n\n\nLevin, Kevin M. 2005. “William Mahone, the Lost Cause, and Civil War History.” The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography 113 (4): 502–3.\n\nWinders, Bill. 1999.

                "To discuss the 1876 presidential election, let's rewind the clock...\n\nFIRST to the 1860 presidential election, where 81.2% of eligible voters (white men) participated. This heated election was a four-way split with Abraham Lincoln (Republican), John C. Breckinridge (the breakaway pro-slavery Southern Democrat), Stephen A. Douglas (the mainstream Democrat, often referred to as a \"Northern Democrat\"), and John Bell (Constitutional Union, a third party neutral on slavery issues). The electoral college went to Lincoln, sealing his victory, but the popular vote was not in his favor (39.8%, meaning 60~% of Americans did not vote for Lincoln). Lincoln's election - and the indifference re: secession from the lame duck president, James Buchanan - among *many* other issues regarding slavery - provoked South Carolina into leaving the Union, followed by several states in early 1861 and the establishment of the Confederacy.\n\nNEXT presidential election is 1864 during the war itself. Turn-out continues to be high (73.8%) which is  impressive considering the number of white men away from home in the battlefield and the new introduction of absentee voting. As to be expected, there is widespread voter fraud. The Union soldiers backed Lincoln, though, and he won the day again. The Civil War ends in 1865, and Lincoln is assassinated soon after. He is replaced by his Vice President, Andrew Johnson, who Republicans do not want to remain in power because he was a bit too sympathetic with white Southerners and showed bigotry towards newly freed African-Americans.\n\nNEXT presidential election is 1868: former Civil War Union general, Ulysses S. Grant (Republican) against New York Governor Horatio Seymour (Democrat). Another high turnout (78.1%). It's electoral slaughter with Grant winning triple digits against Seymour's ninety. But, as with Lincoln's 1860 election, Grant does have a struggle in the popular vote, where Seymour receives a healthy 47~%. This is the first time African-Americans, newly freed from slavery, could vote. In contrast, some white Southerners had not yet gained back their voting rights from their treasonous turn against the U.S. government. Entire states (VA, MS, TX) were termed \"unreconstructed\" and had no electoral vote.\n\nNEXT presidential election is 1872: the incumbent Ulysses S. Grant (Republican) against Horace Greeley (Liberal Republican, a breakaway party from the Republican party). The Democrats did not run anyone, throwing their support behind Greeley. The turn-out (71.3%) was less high, in part because of the confusion with the Democrats' absence and the split Republican ticket. Still much higher than we see today, which fluctuates in the 50s%. Very strangely, Greeley actually died during the vote counting process. Even more strangely, his wife had died the week before the election, so he spent his few weeks left on Earth in a grief-stricken daze. \n\nAnd FINALLY we get to the 1876 presidential election. Presidential elections for the past four cycles had been intense, fraught, and significant for the future of America. You have the spoiler number: 81.8% of eligible voters participated. Certainly, by 1876, American men recognized the importance of the presidential election and their individual vote in the race. In particular, there was a real obsession with what would happen between the Republican and Democratic parties, as they've undergone great stresses in the last sixteen years. Yes, the Civil War was won, but Reconstruction had taken a real toll on both parties. Unlike in the 1872 presidential election, Democrats decided to run and campaign hard.\n\nOur two candidates: Ohio Governor Rutherford B. Hayes (Republican) against New York Governor Samuel J. Tilden (Democrat). Incumbent Republican President Grant decides not to run for a third term, in part because of accusations of corruption in his administration. Democrats had not won a presidential election since the 1856 presidential election twenty years prior.\n\nIssue 1:  White Southerners hated Reconstruction. The white leaders of the Southern states were sick of U.S. federal forces' occupation and influence on state/local governments in the South. Thus, the white South seemed poised to vote Democrat. During the 1876 election season, numerous incidents of pro-Democrat, anti-black violence occurred, including an ugly series of events throughout South Carolina (remember: the first state to secede in 1860). One such event, the Hamburg Massacre, made it clear to white Southerners that anti-black violence / voter intimidation would not be stopped by federal Republican officials, leading to more violence and voter fraud on Election Day. Consequentially, resentment towards \"carpetbagger\" Northerners and Republicans was now intertwined with resentment towards freed African-Americans. Note that in 1876 (11 years post-war) three ex-Confederate states still were under Republican governmental control: Florida, South Carolina, and Louisiana. And white Southerners hated this ongoing federal Reconstruction: it denied them self-government. They wanted it over. The Democrats agreed. Strangely, so did many Republicans by 1876. It didn't matter: the Democrats had a stronghold in the South founded on resentment of federal intervention and a rejection of black progress.\n\nIssue 2: The Civil War was not fully over. Many Republicans  resented the rise of the ex-Confederate back to his full voting rights. One campaign song, [\"The Voice of the Nation's Dead,\"](_URL_1_) included lyrics such as \"Our Country from all Traitors we must save\" (traitors being ex-Confederate Southerners) and \"Tilden aided Treason\" (re: Tilden's conservative anti-Republican views). Republicans contrasted Hayes' valorous military service in the Union Army (he was repeatedly wounded but continued to serve) with Tilden's war-time criticism of Lincoln and disdain for Republicanism. Republicans even accused Tilden and Democrats of [inspiring intimidation and violence of Northern men](_URL_2_)  (the so-called \"carpetbaggers\", who brought all their belongings to the South in bags made from carpet) who had relocated South at the polls. Republicans \"Waved the Bloody Shirt\" of the Civil War, as it was known then.\n\nIssue 3: In 1876, the United States was struggling economically. Since 1873, the country had been suffering through an economic depression and financial panic, which incited frustration against the incumbent Republican party, who many blamed. More people show up to vote to expel the incumbent party when times are rough. (A more recent example of this case is Herbert Hoover and FDR in the Great Depression.) So, surprisingly, the Democrats have an edge by having NOT been in presidential power for a while.\n\nIssue 4: That strange third party from the 1872 presidential election: the Liberal Republicans. These undecided men had to find a new home, and the Democrats went in for the embrace. They took on the policies of Liberal Republicans and propped up Tilden as their candidate: an anti-Tammany Hall, anti-corruption honest man. Liberal Republicans, who had been repulsed by the corruption in Reconstruction and the Grant administration in 1868 and 1872 terms, were pleased with the nomination. BUT the Republican nominee Rutherford B. Hayes looked equally as good, if not better, for his life-long dedication to honor and honesty, and of course, this was naturally their home party. When Republicans rejected a candidate interested in the spoils system and chose Hayes, the party won back many Liberal Republicans, though notably not all.\n\nIssue 5: The swing states - oh the swing states! If you look at [the electoral map for the 1876 election,](_URL_0_) you'll see some states far North have gone blue (Democrat). Tilden campaigned hard in his home state of New York, and he won it (note: NY had gone Republican in 1860, 1864, and 1872). Several other states swung Democrat that were situated around New York, such as New Jersey and Connecticut, which were key to achieving electoral victory. Further west, Indiana also proved to be a contested ground, with the difference of five thousand voters turning the state in favor of Tilden and the Democrats. \n\nThe swing states added up: by the end of the Election Night, Tilden and the Democratic Party had amassed 184 electoral college votes, one shy of winning the whole thing. But those three aforementioned states under federal reconstruction - Florida, South Carolina, and Louisiana - were in dispute. (So was Colorado, which had just become a state). These 20 votes cast the whole election into confusion, leading to a massively political/cultural mess called the Compromise of 1877 (which put Hayes into the presidency and officially ended federal Reconstruction).\n\nOh - and finally, perhaps most importantly - Issue 6: Fraud. So much fraud. The percentage - 81.8% - is based on *reported* numbers of ballots cast. Corruption raised hell during the 1876 presidential election in terms of counting votes. South Carolina boasted 101% of eligible voters participated in the election. Florida and Louisiana similarly saw inflated numbers. Democrats threatened both black and white Republicans with violence in the South. Not to be outdone, several Northern states also saw inflated and almost impossible numbers of eligible voters coming to the polls. This massive amount of fraud led to the electoral confusion and disputed Southern states, which in turn brought about the Compromise of 1877.\n\nSo whether 81.8% of eligible American voters in 1876 actually participated... will never be known. But, without a doubt, the 1876 presidential election was both impressively strange and contentious.\n\n*Final note:* I do not do political history by trade. I research social and cultural history in the Civil War Era. I acknowledge there may be errors here. I look forward to reading other answers!\n\n*Sources Below.*"

                "If they ~~were blind from birth~~ developed without a retina or optic tract then it's likely they wouldn't experience any visual phenomena. This is because in order for your brain to be able to represent a particular visual phenomenon it first needs to experience that [kind of] sensation and then encode the statistical patterns that are associated with it. Your brain basically starts out knowing nothing about the visual world and through visual experience builds a dictionary of various visual features. The beginnings of this are initiated before birth through so called retinal waves, which induce the initial organization of primary visual cortex into so called feature maps (orientation maps being the most studied), but this process has been shown to require actual visual experience to stabilize. \n\nTo answer your question then, it depends on the source of their blindness. If the individual had an intact retina before birth they might have a faint visual experience during direct stimulation of the visual cortex, while those missing the retina entirely would most likely not experience any visual sensation. There is also a chance that given enough time the visual areas of the brain would look for new inputs, from different senses, such that even if they had early visual experience the visual areas of the brain may have been rewired to process other sensory modalities.\n\nSource: PhD student working on computational modelling of the development of the early visual system.\n\nEdit: Corrections.",

What is REALLY intriguing, I think, is what the blind see if they gain sight in adulthood- that is, after their visual system has adapted to blindness since birth. There are some very interesting papers out there on this topic.\n\n[Here](_URL_4_) is a case study about a man who gained sight after 52 years of blindness.\n[Here](_URL_2_) is a link to Project Prakash, a HUGE ongoing research project on late recovery from blindness and how the visual system adjusts to sight.\nAnother interesting avenue is what happens to the visual system when the situation is reversed- when sighted people are suddenly blinded (hallucinations ensue!)- [here](_URL_1_) and [here](_URL_0_) are articles on that.

There is reassignment of some visual cortex over the years, yes.  However, not to the point where your whole visual cortex would be used.  Remember, the human brain is 1/3 occipital lobe.  That means 1/3 of your brain is your \"video card\".  You cannot reassign 1/3 of your brain to other functions, or else you would be a scientific anomaly with close-to-superpowers.  There would absolutely be a visual experience for the person who was blind from birth, you can do this in 2 minutes with a process caled TMS.  They would not know what is happening, and might not be able to report to you the strange experience, but they will have some sort of visual artifacts if you stimulate their visual cortex.  They will describe the feelings as alien, and absolutely bizarre.  My favorite example of this is using TMS to stimulate visual cortex region 4, which makes colors flash in your visual field.  If you do this to people who are color blind, they can sometimes see the colors that they could never see with their eyes.  They describe these colors as \"alien colors\" that don't exist on earth.

You might also encounter the term \"back pressure\" when referring to the pressure that any flow restriction will cause upstream of itself. When flowing water out of a hose, for example, pressure is exchanged for kinetic energy of the flow.

                "I cannot speak about Patton's views but Truman absolutely demanded that action be taken regarding the state of the DP camps and the way DPs were being treated in the American zone.\n\nAfter protests, President Truman sent Earle G. Harrison of the UPenn to see the Army's treatment of the DPs firsthand. Harrison reported back, “As matters now stand, we appear to be treating the Jews as the Nazis treated them except that we do not exterminate them. They are in concentration camps in large numbers under our military guard instead of SS troops. One is lead to wonder whether the German people, seeing this, are not supposing that we are following or at least condoning Nazi policy.” \n\nThis led Truman to write a letter to Eisenhower in August of 1945 stating, in part, “...we have particular responsibility toward these victims of persecution and tyranny ~~(Jews)~~ who are in our zone. We must make clear to the German people that we oughly abhor the Nazi policies of hatred and persecution. We have no better opportunity to demonstrate this than in the manner in which we ourselves actually treat the survivors remaining in Germany.” Truman's letter led to the treatment of DPs and the state of DP camps to become a priority for the US Army. According to Major Irving Heymont, some soldiers were sympathetic while some were annoyed by the problems the DPs caused.\n\nSource: Among the Survivors of the Holocaust - 1945,  The Landsberg DP Camp Letters of Major Irving Heymont, US Army\nThe American Jewish Archives, Cincinnati, OH 1982\n\n**Edit**: changed to UPenn, crossed out \"(Jews)\" in the quote from Truman's letter as it was my addition in my notes I pulled the quote from.",
                "I can't speak on Patton directly, but American journalists working in Bavaria in August of 1945 reported that the population of Bavaria expanded from 7.5 million to 10 million due to an influx of displaced persons that were housed in camps in that region. Displaced persons were supposed to receive 2000 calories per day as a food ration. In contrast, regular German citizens who weren't pregnant, working hard labor, or sick, were to receive 800 calories per day, with American authorities optimistic that they could survive the winter and increase this ration to 1100 calories. \n\nChoosing Bavaria as a hub for refugee camps makes sense given that Bavaria was also considered the \"breadbasket\" of Germany due to the relative thriving of its agricultural lands compared to the rest of Germany (and much of Europe as well). This is important because the food situation in post-war Europe was quite dire, and it remained so for the next few years. The occupying military forces from all of the respective nations had a tendency overestimate how much food would be available in the near future to score political points, and food imports from Britain and - most critically - the United States, were irregular and a source of domestic contention. The food ration for German citizens fluctuated throughout the immediate postwar period, but it would be years before there was enough food being both domestically produced and imported from foreign nations to satisfy a 2000 calorie diet.\n\nThink of the phrase \"living paycheck to paycheck,\" and then imagine that the reserves of stored food in an entire nation would literally be finished in a few days or a few weeks (depending on the region) unless another shipment of foreign foodstuffs arrived, and then imagine this scenario continuing without abatement for at least four or five years.\n\nWith all of this in mind, it is likely that many displaced persons were probably not fed as much as was planned. Whether or not Patton intentionally mistreated displaced persons is an interesting question that I cannot answer, but the overall treatment of displaced persons was certainly tied to the agricultural and economic crisis of the post-war years in Europe, and it is unlikely they made it through the ordeal without their own physical and psychological suffering due to the food shortage.\n\nMy final research project for my undergraduate in history focused on American industrial and agricultural policy in post-war Germany and its relationship with US-Soviet relations. Since I didn't have physical access to the archives in Washington DC, which would have provided these statistics directly from the American military government at the time, I relied primarily on archived newspaper reports from American journalists in Germany (along with documents in the *Foreign Relations of the United States* from 1945, 1946, and 1947, published by the State Department). Here are some of the headlines and brief synopses I originally wrote during my initial research to get a better sense of the overall food picture:\n\nMcLaughlin, Kathleen, “Food in Germany to be Sufficient: Bavaria Has Surpluses of Beef and Potatoes for Shipment to Other Areas,” The New York Times, August 09, 1945, p. 18.\n\t\n(After harvest, enough food in Germany to prevent starvation for winter 1945-46, but less than other liberated nations; U.S. zone increasing rations from 800 to 1,100 calories per day; 400 head of cattle delivered to Berlin from Bavaria weekly; Bavarian population expanded from 7.5 million to 10 million due to refugees, demobilized soldiers; German civilians receive 1,100 calories, displaced persons at camps receive 2,000 calories; hard laborers, expectant mothers, and the ill receive more calories)\n\n---, \"General Food Cut in Germany Seen: U.S. Officials Declare British Action Will Be Felt in All Zones - French Supply Low,\" The New York Times, March 02, 1946, p. 3. \n\n(Less than 10 days of food left in French territory with no aid in sight; unable to maintain ‘normal’ food supply of 1550 calories per person; considering pooling the food supplies of all four zones together; Lieut. Col. Stanley Andrews interviewed, said that normal supply would require peacetime rationing in the USA until harvest in early fall; German farmers producing more grain now than under Nazi regime, despite poor infrastructure; Soviet Government delivered 92 carloads of sugarbeet and vegetable seeds, fulfilling the remaining seed needs for the American zone)\n\n---. “British Seek Aid On German Food; Crisis in Their Zone Remains Acute as Talks Begin,” The New York Times, November 17, 1946, p. 114.\n\n(British argue that lowered US imports to blame for food crisis; critics argue that raising ration from 1,350 to 1,550 was a political maneuver to influence October 20 elections in bizonal area; majority of British zone industry in Ruhr – six million German inhabitants need food in order to operate industry; domestic potato production lower than expected, starvation imminent in Rhineland and Westphalia)   \n\n“U.S. Zone Forbids German Food Cut,” The New York Times, November 24, 1946, p. 13.\n\n(Military government refused to cut ration from 1,550 to 1,300 by the recommendation of the British-United States Food and Agriculture Committee in Greater Hesse; city workers leave industrial posts to search for food; some factories experience 50% of workers missing; in Wurttemberg, none of the demand for potatoes and only half of grain demand can be met; farmers continue to resist requisition efforts; America lent 50,000 tons of food to British zone, hoping to be paid back within several months) \n\nClark, Delbert, “German Food Crisis Is Growing Worse; Farmers Hold Back; U.S. Shipping a Factor,” The New York Times, December 30, 1946, p. 3.\n\n(British and Americans raised rations from 1,235 to 1,550 calories per day in September; unrealistic, as no guarantees put into place to maintain such levels until next harvest; political maneuver to influence October elections; farmers in American and Soviet zones unable or unwilling to meet quota demands; American zone depends on Soviet food as well; America planned to allow full potato ration to Germans to cover mid-October 1946 to July 1947 in one delivery, now uncertain if such program would work; in September, October, 50,000 metric tons of food imported from USA monthly, need 92,333 metric tons monthly through June 1947 to meet the caloric ration; grain crop 22% below 1939-1944 average; industrial production continues to climb, 85% gain since year began; heavy industry at 50% of 1936 levels, light industry 37%, 44% average of 1936)\n\n“German Food Ration Cut,” The New York Times, January 23, 1948, p. 3.\n\n(UK-USA military governments cut food ration from 1,550 to 1,200 – 1,400 calories per day, depending on location; the Ruhr region particularly distressed, critical due to high levels of industry; more strikes in Ruhr and Bavaria; states to receive imported food only if they meet indigenous quotas; dietary fat shortage in bizonal area; 5,000 tons of fat released for February, half to the Ruhr)\n"

This helps to thematically group my passwords for ease of remembrance.\n\nNow French, German, and Spanish are pretty common, but if you start substituting any more exotic languages you know (or want to learn!), the difficulty skyrockets. Gaelic, african languages, asian languages, finno-ugric, fictional languages, etc. can get as wild as some random string of characters.",

                "Uhhh, sort of, but not really. Octavian was enrolled into the senate at Cicero's urging without having held any senatorial magistracy early in 43 when he was still 19. Theoretically you were supposed to not be eligible for the quaestorship, and thus the senate, for like another 10 years--special enrollments were far from unknown, however, and really pretty common after Caesar got back from the civil war. What *is* unusual is that he was granted extraordinary *imperium*. This was essentially a recognition, really, of the already considerable private army that he illegally held, and an attempt by Cicero to firmly adhere it to the state. Private citizens with illegal armies being granted *imperium* were not totally unknown, nor was it unprecedented that they individuals might be quite young--Pompey was 23 when he recruited three legions at Pisenum as a private citizen--but it was still unusual. Octavian's unprecedented power, however, that resulted in his appointment to the consulship late in 43, was largely accidental. The deaths of the consuls Hirtius and Pansa, to whom he was subordinate, in battle had left him with a force several times larger, and in a stroke of extreme good fortune the consuls had been victorious, allowing Octavian the leeway to both negotiate with Antony and threaten the city without fear of serious attack to his rear. It's easy to imagine this rather fortuitous string of circumstances going a totally different way.\n\nIndividuals of extreme power had risen previously both at a young age and through extraordinary avenues. The greatest example was Pompey. We've already seen that at only 23 Pompey had raised a private army and two years later he was in Sicily with a propraetorian commission to root out anti-Sullans--attaching himself to Sulla both politically and legally (he married Sulla's stepdaughter probably by or before 82) allowed Pompey all kinds of avenues for rapid unorthodox advancement. By the time of Pompey's (illegal, he was not old enough nor was he yet a member of the senate) triple triumph at 27 he had power equal or even greater to Octavian's, though he didn't immediately convert it into a consulship the way Octavian did--Octavian was somewhat helped by the fact that in his case the dictator was dead and the state in disarray, whereas Sulla was still very much alive and kicking when Pompey was climbing the ladder. Like Octavian Pompey was appointed to the consulship without having ever held electoral office (he was the first to do so)--Pompey did it in 70, though, at the age of 36. Pompey probably could have gotten the consulship earlier but was more interested in fighting wars in Spain and against Spartacus following his triumph. So in that respect Octavian's actual *legal* power certainly far surpassed Pompey's, although Pompey's power as a young man was certainly comparable, even if he didn't immediately convert it into magistracies the way Octavian did"

                "Let's take Netflix for example. When you open a connection it uses one of there many ports to communicate. That costs money. And streaming all that data costs alot to what ever ISP they are using. Simply closing that connections saves you ***both*** a couple bucks",

Basically, there's a cost involved, either energy consumption, bandwidth utilization,  or wear and tear on components,  in order to provide that stream. If you're not watching,  they can save that cost by stopping the stream.",
                "There are several things:\n\n1. Bandwidth is cheap, but not free. If 10% of the people have put it on but aren't watching anymore, that is still 10%. If you are serving a million people, that is wasted bandwidth of 100 000 people. Small amounts with large numbers still adds up.\n\n2. Statistics. The service wants to know if people are actually watching. They know if you watch, they know if you stop, they know if you preview, they know if you rewind, they now know if you are not watching.\n\n3. Royalties. (This is a guess, but wouldn't surprise me). If you don't need to play, you don't need to pay.\n",
                "Netflix (et al) automatically play the next episode in a series. People fall asleep while binging. The \"still watching\" dialog shuts off the stream. Everyone is mentioning the benefits to Netflix. But it also benefits the user. \n\n1. If you have a bandwidth cap, this stops it.\n2. If you're watching a series, presumably you want to watch it. By stopping it while you're not watching it makes it easier for you to pick up where you left off.\n\nSo something that benefits both Netflix and the user is obviously good."

                "The first wave of emigration happened after the Reichstagsbrand/ burning of the Reichstag on the 27 February 1933. The Reichstagsbrand was used as a legitimisation for the Nazis to implement an emergency legislation, the \"Notverordnung zum Schutz von Volk und Staat\" which enabled them to imprison political opponents. \nFurther the \"Gesetz zur Wiederherstellung des Berufbeamtentums“ (Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service) got implemented on the 7 April 1933. This law officially banned Jews, as well as political opponents, from all civil service jobs. There where exceptions for Jews who fought for Germany in WWI, but even this privilege ended in 1935. \nThere was also a law introduced in 1933, the „Gesetz gegen die Überfüllung deutscher Schulen und Hochschulen“, which made Jews unable to visit higher schools and universities.  \nSo in 1933 it was more their livelihood than their life that was threatened. At this point, it were mainly highly educated Jews and Intellectuals who left Germany.  \n \n\n\nThe second wave of immigration started in autumn of 1935. The \"Nürnberger Gesetze“ (Nuremberg Laws) were introduced on 15 September 1935. One law was the „Gesetz zum Schutz des deutschen Blutes und der deutschen Ehre“ (Law of the Protection of the German Blood and German Honour), which forbade marriages and sex between Jews and Germans, as well as the employment of a german woman under the age of 45 in a Jewish household. \nThe second law, the Reichsbürgergesetz (Reich Citizen Law), basically declared that only Germans and those of related blood were able to classify as citizens. Everyone else automatically lost their citizenship and was classed as state subjects. This was the point, where the Ariernachweis/Aryan certificate was officially implemented. \nWhile this seems like a really big red flag in hindsight, there were quiet some Jews, who hoped the Nuremberg Laws would help them in the long run. Some orthodox circles even supported the part that forbade a marriage between a Jew and a non-Jew. Others believed that their life in the future maybe wouldn't be easy, but Germany as a constitutional state would still be a place worth living. Many felt a strong connection to Germany and their home towns and were unwilling to even thjink about fleeing. \n \n\nLeaving Germany as a Jew wasn't easy, even thought one of the stated goals of the Nazis was that all Jews should leave Germany. Jews were required to pay up to 90% of their wealth as a tax(the Reichsfluchtsteuer) for simply leaving Germany. Transferring money overseas was a punishable crime. This made it significantly more difficult to start a new life somewhere far away from home. An exception was Palestine, due to the Haavara Agreement. \n\n\nAfter the Novemberprogrom (Crystal Night) on the 9-10 November 1938 many more Jews wanted to flea Germany, as it marked the trasition from discrimination to systematic persecution. This was he point, where most if not all Jews understood, that there was no future for them in Germany, no matter how much they would try to assimilate. But at this point, there were almost no countries willing to take them anymore. Nonetheless, more than 40,000 Jews were able to leave the country in 1938, in 1939 it were around 78,000. \n\nWith the start of the war emigration was almost impossible. Only 30,000-35,000 Jews were able to escape. \n\nIn Oktober 1941 the Auswanderungsverbot (ban on emigration) got implemented. After that Jews were not able to leave the country on legal ways and even illegal ways were nearly impossible due to the war related events in and around Germany. \n\nSources:\n\n\nMommsen, Hans.

It is a lot like the gerrymandering issue - the loser sits and talks about how biased it is, but the minute he is in control he does the same thing.\n\nAs a somewhat conservative (at least fiscally...) southerner, the GOP is honestly just trying to make Obama look as bad as they can, because they HATE him. There have been several articles about how in recent decades congressmen have become more split along party lines than ever. Where as before they would argue politically while in session, and then still have the ability to go to diner together, merely associating with someone now is a way to lose party support. This has caused a hard line stance, where both sides seek to attack the other instead of focusing on the issues at hand.\n\nIf a republican wins next election, you can be damn sure that democrats will be up in arms over him ever using executive orders.",

                "If everyone will calm down and take a step back for a moment, I might be able to help shed a little bit of light on the issue.\n\nPart of the problem stems from a misunderstanding of what is and is not an Executive Order.\n\nMany of the things that people reference when they talk about Executive Order are actually policy directives— federal government directions that originate from the White House but are not actually codified on paper as official Executive Orders. By and large, most Executive Orders tend to be relatively boring things such as Prohibiting Certain Imports of Burmese Jadeite and Rubies (EO 13651) or Continuance of Certain Federal Advisory Committees (EO 13585). Policy directives, on the other hand, are often related to hot-button issues. As a result, it may seem that Obama has signed a lot of Executive Orders when in reality it’s just that he’s issued a lot of controversial policy directives. (The complete list of Obama’s EOs can be found at _URL_1_).\n\nObama tends to exercise his policy directives and executive authority in ways that are specifically designed to cut Congress out of the decision making process when Obama knows that Congressional Republicans will not go along with him. The Republican dislike of his Executive Orders is a facet of their general view that Obama uses executive authority to sidestep Constitutional checks and balances.\n\nOne example of this is his decision in June 2012 to stop deporting some illegal immigrants if they met certain criteria. This directive included some of the same provisions that were in the DREAM Act, which the Republicans killed in Congress. They defeated it in Congress, only to see parts of it resurface a short time later in the form of a policy directive. Source: _URL_0_\n\nNext, there was the 2013 executive decision to delay the implementation deadlines for parts of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). This didn’t sit well with Republicans since what it amounted to was the president changing a law after it had been passed by Congress— to an old-school conservative, that’s a pretty giant breach of the separation of powers— largely, many Republicans believed, to delay the political fall-out from the deadlines until after the midterm elections.\nSource: _URL_4_\n\nAdditionally, there were his appointments to the National Labor Relations Board; these appointments normally need Congressional approval unless Congress is in recess. He declared that Congress was in recess (despite the fact that Congress specifically said that it wasn’t) and then made the appointments without their approval. These appointments were later struck down by the Supreme Court as invalid, which only further fueled the Republican view that Obama is using his executive authority to sidestep Constitutional checks and balances.\nSource: _URL_2_\n\nAs one final example, in 2010 Obama decided the government would no longer legally defend the Defense of Marriage Act. This raised the ire of Republicans because this was the federal government saying it would no longer uphold a law that was still legally in effect, which again cut Congress out of the picture in deciding what should and should not be law (plus, the content of the Act was another obvious reason it annoyed Republicans so much).\nSource: _URL_3_\n\nWhile much of what irritates Republicans are policy directives and not Executive Orders, the Executive Orders are an easier political targets since they are tangible documents and require less explaining than policy directives; this in turn makes it appear as though Obama is writing his own laws in violation of the Constitution which fits in nicely to political narrative the Republicans are presenting.\n\n**TL;DR People often think a lot of the things that Obama does are Executive Orders when in reality they are just policy directives. Republicans believe that Obama uses these policy directives to sidestep Constitutional separation of powers, and lumping policy directives in with Executive Orders is a good political attack strategy.**",

They protect you by killing foreign bacteria and they help you digest your food.\n\nB) you have a very strong immune presence in your gut and you even have a whole nervous system dedicated to it called the enteric nervous system. These two coordinate to prevent infection.\n\nC) things don't just diffuse through your gut to your blood. There's a very tight barrier. The cells have what you may call a biological seal between them preventing things from passing through. While it can't prevent small things like some ions and water and so on (depends on the region of the gut) it most certainly blocks big things like bacteria. Things that get to your blood usually have to go the transcellular path (as opposed to paracellular). This means the cells lining up your gut take them up actively or passively at the front door (apical or luminal side) and they go out the back door (basolateral side) where the blood vessels are.\n\nDepending on the drug, some passively take the paracellular path as they're small and their properties permit it. Others passively pass through the membrane of the cells due to their chemical properties or they get taken up by the cells like nutrients. So it's a very different thing. Pathogens are big, they can't go about unnoticed. And waste products that the body doesn't want, have no specialized way to cross to the blood, that's why they even stay out in the lumen (inside of the gut tube).",
                "Your guts, the whole several meters of it, is basically separates in two parts: the first is the longer one, the thin one, who's job is to extract most of the nutrients from the ,what is at that point, mush.\n\nThe rectum is the end of the second, significantly shorter, part that has the task of reabsorbing as much water as it can. Water is made of much smaller molecules than nutrients so it's absorbed, allowed to pass through the wall. Same applies to certain drugs. They are either very similar in size to water or bind to water and carried into the bloodstream along with the water.",
                "Because the stuff in your poop is already the stuff that your body can't absorb. That's why it's waste in the first place. Everything else that was absorbable like water and nutrients was already absorbed in your intestines.",
                "Your body has spent several hours trying to absorb every last nutrient it can from the food you eat, the stuff that winds up in your colon is what is left over, the stuff that can't be absorbed.\n\nThe primary purpose of the colon is to reabsorb water, so anything water-soluble gets picked up pretty easily."

                "My tutor at university carried out a lot of research into deep sea organisms, part of which was their recovery to the surface in order to study them. I don't recall if he did any work with fish, but he definitely talked about what they look like when they're recovered from deep sea trawls.\n\nOne of the major features of a fishes anatomy is the swim bladder, a gas filled sack that they use to maintain their vertical position in the water column, this is obviously maintained at a pressure more or less equal to the surrounding water (otherwise they would rapidly sink/float). In the majority of cases the fish is unable to change the pressure of the swim bladder rapidly enough to cope with the speed of ascent experienced by animals recovered from the deep sea (each 10m of water is equivalent to 1 atmosphere of pressure, so an organism brought up from a few thousand metres experiences a huge pressure change). As a result of this the bladder is frequently irreparably damaged. This is not only an issue for the study of deep sea fish, unwanted catch (bycatch) in commercial fisheries is often discarded at the surface, but will not survive the process as they have experienced severe stress from the catching process, including damage to the swim bladder. \n\nThe work my tutor did mainly focused on invertebrates, I was lucky enough to see the apparatus he was involved in developing imagine a stainless steel tube about 70cm high and 35across, in this was drilled a hole big enough to take a smallish (~10cm carapace width) crab or similar. Using this, and a whole range of pumps and chillers etc, they were able to perform experiments on deep sea inverts without them being depressurised. Last I heard they were struggling to develop ways to feed the animals, without which their experiments were regrettably curtailed!",

                "In many ways the Tanzimat reforms DID succeed in modernizing the empire, especially if we don't take the traditional end date of the reforms (the promulgation of the 1st constitution in 1876) and include Abdülhamid's and the Young Turk's continuing reforms, many of which were in the same vein as the original Tanzimat. If you want to look at just about any aspect that we would consider \"modernizing,\" the Ottoman Empire made continual progress throughout the latter part of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. They enacted many liberal reforms (rolled back under Abdülhamid but reinstated after his overthrow), dramatically reorganized governance so that Istanbul was calling the shots, instituted widespread education for boys AND girls, instituted a modern conscription system that equipped their men with modern weapons (while the Ottomans lost wars like the 1877-78 Russo-Turkish War and the 1912-13 Balkan Wars, they also won some against Greece in the same period. And it's not like the Russians or Balkan powers totally steamrolled the Ottomans, there were several important successes for the Ottomans in each war, and the general consensus is they lost those wars due to poor planning and leadership rather than inferior arms), and the economy dramatically expanded. A lot of that wealth was funneled out of the country because of poor financial planning, especially immediately following the Crimean War, but that doesn't mean there wasn't a dramatic uptick in various economic activities, particularly in agriculture. Culturally, the Ottomans were training modern doctors, witnessing an explosion of printed materials, and engaging with the scientific discussions of the day.\n\nI think the main difference is that while the Japanese were literally doing this on the far side of the world, the Ottomans were doing it in the backyard of the major European powers. When the Japanese defeated the Russians in 1904-1905, the Japanese defeated the Russian fleet. The Russians sent their Baltic fleet, which took SIX MONTHS to sail to Japan, where it was promptly defeated. Compare this to the Russo-Turkish War, where the main body of the Russian army was able to invade both sides of the Ottoman Empire at the same time. (Incidentally, the Ottomans were very much inspired that the Japanese had such success with their reforms, and the Young Turks used it as a motivational tool to demonstrate that they could, too.) The Austrians were able to annex Bosnia, because it was right on their border. The British could get to Egypt in 5 days under steam. The list goes on. In any conflict with the Europeans, the Ottomans were immediately under massive threat. Invading Japan was a massive logistical problem. \n\nThat is just the logistical difference. The Ottomans declared bankruptcy in 1875, after taking on a ton of bad loans after the Crimean War. The European creditors set up a Public Debt Administration that took first crack at Ottoman tax revenues to make sure the creditors got paid. This was on top of a number of unfavorable trade agreements known as the Capitulations. In early modern times, the Ottomans gave them as favors from a position of strength. By the 1800s, they were traded for European support, such as granting the British a massive break in tax on British goods in 1838 in exchange for British help against the rebellious Mehmet Ali Pasha of Egypt. Anyways, the Europeans had their fingers firmly in the Ottoman financial pie, which they could enforce because of their close proximity. This does not even take into account the practice of European nations giving their citizenship to local Ottoman Christians, which meant many of the most economically productive of the empire's citizens could not be taxed by Istanbul.\n\ntl;dr: The Tanzimat reforms DID modernize the Ottoman Empire, but close proximity top Europe meant they could not escape ruinous European influence. Japan was far and relatively free to do what they needed to do. I would love to get a Japan expert in here to get that perspective!"

                "Sometimes, you start with a number system and see what you can do in that number system.  Sometimes there are things that can't be done (they are impossible *with respect to that number system*), and so you define a new extended number system for which that operation is possible.\n\nSuppose you start with the whole numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc.\n\nAddition and multiplication of whole numbers always produce whole numbers.  Subtraction sometimes does (5-2) but sometimes it is not defined (4-5).  However, we can define the number -1, so that 4-5 is defined.  And now, if we see what addition and multiplication lead to with this number added, we wind up with the integers (..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...).  So by adding negative numbers, we can now solve any subtraction problem among the whole numbers and, in fact, among the integers.\n\nFractions appear similarly.  12/4 is defined if you're just using integers, but not 2/7.  So we add the rational numbers so that division becomes possible for any integers *a* and *b* (except for dividing by 0).\n\nBut still some equations don't have solutions when you have the rational numbers.  For example, we can't solve x^(2)=2 just using the rational numbers.  So add sqrt(2), and now, if we allow addition, multiplication, subtraction, and division, we'll have to include numbers of the form *p*+*q* sqrt(2), where *p* and *q* are rational numbers.  We can similarly add roots of other numbers to make other equations soluble.\n\nReal numbers are introduced so that a certain class of limiting operations always produces a value.  Other limiting processes lead us to define objects called the p-adic numbers.\n\nIn short, notions of what can and cannot be done depend on your number system, and we have regularly extended our number systems to make more things possible (that is, to make it so that a given operation always yields a result in the number system in which you started).",
                "In a way, all numbers are like this.\n\nIn the case of the complex number system, extensions arise out of operations that have no inverse within the system. For example, the negatives come out of the inverse to addition (subtraction- what the heck do you get when you take away 10 from 4? Ok, let's invent negative numbers.) You can do this for all the types of numbers- \n\nRational - inverse to multiplication. (What the heck should 3 divided into 4 pieces be?)\n\nIrrational - inverse to exponentiation. (What the heck is the square root of two, or three for that matter?)\n\nImaginary - same source. \n\nBut specifically, to answer your question, the answer is yes.\n\nQuaternions are a fascinating extension of the complex plane into 3 dimensions. \n\n_URL_2_\n\nThere is also a little known type of calculus that invents a new type of number called the infinitesimal - a number defined as being so small that there is no number large enough with which you can multiply it and get 1!\n\n_URL_1_\n\n\n_URL_0_",
                "Actually, i was not introduced merely to have a solution to the equation x^2 =-1.  Instead, it was found that working formally with square roots of negative numbers allowed for a solution to the cubic equation (similar to the quadratic formula for solutions to quadratic equations).  I'm not sure why people spread the notion that i was invented just to have a number such that i^2 =-1. But the history is more interesting than that, and more can be read [here](_URL_2_).  \n\nTo answer a related question. Mathematicians do even now occasionally introduce alternate notions of what a solution of an equation is, when the original notion of solution cannot be found. This especially arises in the study of partial differential equations with classical, strong, [weak](_URL_3_), and [viscosity](_URL_1_) solutions. I couldn't find a good online reference to the distinction between strong and classical solutions, except briefly [here](_URL_0_).",
                "I recall reading a short paper back in undergrad (many years ago) where they started with the \"hallucinatory\" number, where\n\n|h| = -1\nwith || implying magnitude, or absolute value.\n\nand they then looked at the implications.  The unit shape was not a circle, but a hyperbola.  They then went and redeveloped special relativity using this.  It was done more as an intellectual exercise than anything else, but it was an interesting paper to this undergrad physics/math double major.",
                "Field Theory, a branch of mathematics, is concerned with this type of problem in the context of polynomials. We're often asked to find the root of a polynomial that doesn't exist, so we \"extend\" our field (numbers in consideration) to find a new solution. For instance, the equation x^2  - 2= 0 has no solution in the rational numbers (i.e. fractions), but in the real numbers, the solution is x = sqrt(2), which can't be expressed as a ratio. In Field Theory, we say the real numbers are an extension of the rational numbers. Likewise, the complex numbers are an extension of the real numbers, because the complex numbers contain a solution to the equation x^2 + 1 = 0. Field Theory, and the rest of modern algebra, is concerned with taking questions rooted in high school algebra and generalizing them to a context where the \"variables\" aren't necessarily numbers.\n\nThere's also the question of how one actually constructs a new number out of the old ones. For instance, if all you know about are the integers, how can you \"define\" what 1/2 is? The construction of our familiar number systems is a complicated process, which you can read about [here](_URL_0_), but I will say that the challenge is defining the new number system in such a way that it obeys our familiar intuition. In other words, we would like the rational numbers to conform to our intuitive notions of adding and multiplying fractions.\n",
                "\"Imaginary\" is the worst name for these numbers.\n\nThere are lots of numbers that are equally \"imaginary\". Negative numbers, for example. Invent an \"imaginary\" number such that adding it to 1 equals zero. Irrational numbers: invent a number defined as the ratio of the circumference of a perfect circle to its diameter. Or: invent a number defined as the square root of 2. There is no rational number that, when squared, is exactly equal to 2.\n\nDoes that make these numbers unreal or \"imaginary\"? Hardly, they are valid numbers with abstract definitions, that's all. There are ways to make negative numbers \"real\" (with temperature or position relative to a point), but there are ways to make \"imaginary\" numbers \"real\" as well (with complex numbers as coordinates, or impedance in electrical circuits).",
                "I feel that everyone stresses the analytic importance of \"i\" but here is a nice geometric understanding of why it is interesting.\n\nFirst note that multiplication can be thought of as rotation and dilation. Indeed, multiplication by a positive number scales the given input by some amount.  For example 5 x 2 can be thought of as scaling 2 by 5 times and not rotating at all. On the other hand -5 x 2 is scaling 2 by 5 times and rotating it by 180 degrees (imagine the real number line and rotate from the positive direction to the negative direction). Now, it is *geometrically* clear that the number line is simply not enough to describe all the sorts of dilations and rotations we might want to access. First of all, what if I want to rotate by 90 degrees an not 180? In such a case we are searching for a number which, when applied twice, will create a 180 degree rotation. Indeed we can call this number \"i\" and it follows that \"i\" serves the purpose of i^2 = -1.\n\nThe truly marvelous thing here is that we can somehow get **all** other rotations and scalings from just this single new rotation!\n\nWith this in mind, it is clear that mathematics does not invent numbers for no good reason. In fact constructions are important to build tools and language for inherently clear problems. These types of abstract constructions give rise to, for example, number fields which have huge implications in internet security and code breaking! (e.g., [elliptic curve cryptography](_URL_0_))"

                "Had a crazy neighbor who did everything *pro se* as a stalling tactic.  The court gave her lots of procedural leeway which she actively used against opponents to delay, cause extra motions etc which made going after her ridiculously expensive. Most would then offer to settle.",

But if someone wants to heal injuries professionally, then we insist that they go to medical school and get a professional license.\n\nSimilarly, every competent adult has the right to represent themselves in court. In fact, the word “represent” here is almost meaningless — you *are* yourself, and you are definitionally capable of speaking for yourself. But we have strict standards for speaking for *other people*, just like we have strict standards for performing surgery on other people, and for the same reason: the consequences of doing it badly are potentially life-altering, and so we demand a high baseline degree of competence.",
                "It’s a backwards way to look at the problem.\n\nWe started from the idea that a person should be responsible for defending themselves.  It quickly became apparent that a person who did so - usually with no training or knowledge - was at a severe disadvantage.  So the courts ruled that everyone should be given a lawyer in an attempt to make things fair.\n\nSo representing yourself came first, and only later did the idea of lawyering come about.  Another way of looking at it might be to assume that representing oneself is the default, and it is only recently that lawyers became de facto mandatory."

Many antibiotics are also derived from compounds produced by molds and other fungi. \n\nThese drugs are (ideally) specifically chosen to amplify the therapuetic effects of the natural version while minimizing the side effects. \n\nHowever, it's almost impossible to have a drug that doesn't have side effects. Even a perfectly targeted drug can do too much of what's its supposed to if you take too much of it (eg too much aspirin causing bleeding), and almost all drugs have off target effects that are hard to predict (eg aspirin causing hearing damage at high doses). \n\nNatural remedies are often either underdosed so they don't have any effects, positive or negative, or are scams that don't contain the active ingredient at all. \n\nRed yeast rice, for example, by law cannot have the active statin compound in it. \n\nAlso, many herbal remedies do have side effects.

                "It is an interesting question that I have encountered preparing my dissertation last year.\n\nThe protection of individual rights and freedoms is a cornerstone of British liberalism that even hard-line Tories shyed away from tampering too much with. Of course the sympathy reserved for someone like Marx and other radicals was different from that reserved for people that were more in line with the moderate stance of the British government. It is however reasonable to think that there was a genuine support in the British middle class for the upholding of these principles, as is possible to gather from informations about charitable subscriptions in the press.\n\nThis type of humanitarianism fit really well with the Victorian vision of being the pinnacle of civilized society and the polar opposite of what was considered continental tyranny.\n\nOf course it is hypocritical how this mindset largely did not extend to native colonial subjects but on British soil continental revolutionaries did enjoy a basic level of tolerance and, depending on the popularity of their cause, even support from different strata of society and lived in one of the arguably less policed societies in Europe.\n\nIf you wish to read more in general about the Victorian approach to humanitarianism I suggest Caroline Shaw's \"Britannia's embrace\". If you are interested in a case study, Elena Bacchin in \"Italofilia\" describes quite in depth the reception and stay of some revolutionary Italian refugees. I think there is an English translation of the latter book but I am not 100% sure."

                "I won't attempt to answer the question, but as a geologist I have to correct your basic assumptions concerning the temperature range of Life As we Know It (LAWKI).\n\nThe uppermost temperature we know of for living and active metazoans (complex multicellular life) is at the edge of actively venting black smokers, where worms of the species *Alvinella pompejana* have been observed \"just chilling\" at temps of 80° C (and at a pH of about 3.5). When it comes to an uppermost limit for microbes and extremophiles, it might even be necessary to go even higher. For instance, in Mississippi Valley type Pb-Zn deposits there is ample evidence for the fractionation of sulphur isotopes from biogenically mediated sulphate reduction up to about 120° C.\n\nSo a revised statement would have to be from about -40° C  up to 120° C; or a range of 160 degrees if you'd rather see it that way. And I'd check that lower limit as well; there has been a lot of recent work on extremophiles and I'd look into data on cryophiles (with which I am admittedly unfamiliar) just to be on the safe side if I were you.",

                "In addition to the excellent points made by Gargatua13013:\n\nThe reason life is only found between certain temperature extremes is because cell structures begin to crystallise below freezing and also begin to malfunction and even break apart at high enough temperatures. Such temperatures thus cannot support normal cellular function or life. The reason that cryophiles can survive (and thrive) at below freezing is because they have evolved adaptations to handle these temperature extremes, such as producing antifreeze, of sorts, for their cells, to prevent cell disruption.",

It's possible that some sort of life based on cold liquid hydrocarbons instead of liquid water exists on Titan, but at the current time all work done on the subject is speculative and we have no real evidence for any sort of life there yet.",

Water is a really awesome solvent for a lot of things, so we have a large number of really interesting life forms.  Maybe on a planet cold enough for a liquid nitrogen environment some crazy thing evolved.  A more educated individual might comment here on which solvents are more likely, as I'm fairly certain liquid nitrogen isn't one of them.\n ",

I think that if we can accept the possibility of life, in some form, outside of the Earth's atmosphere then we to broaden the views we have.  \n\nIf you look at life on our own little planet you see that life exist in places as diverse as the bottom of the ocean at thermal vents, where not only is there life but many forms. The coldest regions of the planet also contain a varied set of life forms that live through extreme conditions.\n\n The animals that really amazes me has already been mentioned, the tardigrade or water bear. This little thing has been abused by everything from the vacuum and radiation of space to boiling, freezing, dehydration, starvation to take your pick and it consistently survives. They are also relatively cute. Something any kid might want as a pet and couldn't kill no matter how many time they forgot to take care of it. \n\nI think you put it best in saying \"we cannot imagine\" that is our limit for discovery. It is possible that the nature of life can only exist at some temperature spectrum but we still don't have a definite understanding of life. We barely understand the life around us let alone what could be happening more than a hundred or so miles or more above our heads. ",

If the temperature gets too low the water freezes, if it gets too high then the water boils and proteins lose their tertiary structure (they deform in shape and are unable to perform their function). There are extremophiles which are adapted to live outside the normal thermal range of most life. \n\nSome produce proteins which function as natural antifreeze which allow them to exist at temperatures below zero. However at these temperatures metabolism becomes very slow as the molecules have very little energy and do not move around much. When temperatures become extremely low these reactions will cease as they cannot overcome the activation energy.\n\nThere are also extremophiles which are able to withstand higher temperatures. They generally do so by having more robust protein structures which are able to maintain function at higher temperatures. There would be a limit at where the temperature was too great and the molecular bonds would simply break.",
                "\"could there be lifeforms we cannot imagine\"\n\nI'd imagine not.\n\nIn all seriousness, we'd need to explore some more varied environments than can be found on Earth to figure that out.  After all, our history is replete with instances of people flatly stating that something is impossible, right up until the moment that someone does it.  Likewise, we're most likely to find that life can exist in such conditions when we find one.  All of the biology we know is based on the things contained within the limits you mention in your question, because that's everywhere we've gone.",

If we have even the slightest shot at discovering life on other planets, we have to keep an open mind, because in reality, we don't know dick about what it takes to support life. \n\nSo I believe that, yes, life can exist outside of the temperature range we know of because our sample size is miniscule.

Theoretically, sure - a fantastical form of life *could* arise in more extreme temperatures, or perhaps even in the vacuum of space.  We don't know enough about life to say yes or no, because we've only ever seen life from this planet.",
                "The main issue is that our view and definition of life is quite limited by the \"few\" examples of life we see on Earth...the variety of adaptations, allowed chemical pathways, and various environmental conditions is absolutely staggering if you consider all possible planets, all possible stars, and all possible elements in the periodic table as a basis for your hypothetical lifeforms.\n\n\nThere is also hard limit, however: the temperature associated with total deionization of any element within the periodic table. After this point, all possible basic chemistry vanishes and is replaced with complex plasma interactions. You could conceivably have life exist without chemistry, but it would make things a lot harder to 1) start an evolution-like process, and 2) maintain that process. Normal stellar temperatures (2000 K+) provide a rough limit.\n\n\n**tl;dr**: too much heat makes it exponentially harder for self-replicating things to maintain themselves; stellar temperatures provide that temperature limit if we assume life requires basic chemistry (not necessarily organic chemistry).",

Some kinds can also thrive on the opposite side of the spectra and live in extreme cold. These organisms are a good example of how life can find a way. Who knows maybe on other planets where life seems impossible these organisms reign supreme.",
                "The other answers have described how *chemical* life requires certain characteristics like a liquid solvent and certain carbon-like elements for building blocks for metabolism, protein, and genetics. \n\nAny life based on these principles will be restricted to those temperatures, because that's where the chemistry works.\n\nHowever, other life is theoretically possible. For example, artificial intelligence would be a life form based on electrical signals (or optical, for some types of computers). If it occurred naturally, it could exist at cryogenic temperatures. By some standards, that's negative infinity - 1 K is half as warm as 2K, 0.5k is half that, and so on - you can always get colder!  But that's a big \"if\"! With millions of man-years and trillions of dollars invested in electronics, we can't make it happen artificially yet. The minimum bar for self-replicating chemical structures in a primordial soup is high, this one seems even higher.   That a working computer with enough working hardware to make a semiconductor manufacturing plant and electrical power plant, plus a hard drive with bits randomly selected to execute an artificial intelligence program would randomly start up seems too unlikely. But if it did, you would have life at a wide range of temperatures somewhere in the universe.\n\nAlso, life could theoretically occur at temperatures much higher than chemical reactions. Nuclear reactions, for example! There is a fantastic hard sci-fi novel about life on a neutron star, where strong nuclear forces cause interactions between protons and neutrons at extreme temperatures under unimaginable gravity and produce life. It's called \"Dragon's Egg\" by Robert Forward. The temperature of a neutron star is on the order of 10^6 to 10^12 K! There aren't stable environments in the universe much hotter than that, so that would be the other end of the scale.",
                "One of the primary constraints operating here is the temperature of liquid water, which is used as a carrier medium for metabolic processes on earth. Frozen water allows insufficient mobility for chemical processes, and steam is too diffuse to be of much help. However, life-forms can survive and operate at sub-freezing temperatures since their water contains other elements that reduce the freezing point and they produce heat energy helping to maintain temperature. There are life forms that survive at near-boiling temperatures, but these temperatures tend to have sufficient energy to re-organize complex carbon chains, making things relatively unstable. Increased pressure helps make things a bit more stable, so high-temperature life forms are more likely to be seen underwater at depth.\n\nTheoretically, it may be possible for a liquid other than water to perform a similar function, but it would need to be fairly neutral chemically and mix readily with chemicals supporting life processes. Such a liquid may operate within a very different temperature range. A very different temperature range may also require something other than carbon chains as the building-block of life.",
                "Depends on what your definition of life is. If you mean locally entropy-minimizing self-replicating assemblages of baryonic matter that evolved naturally from simple precursors, then water+carbon may be the only game in town.\n\nIf your definition includes non-evolved (I.e. designed) systems - aka machines - then it is conceivable that complex self-sustaining and/or self-replicating systems could exist on more exotic substrates (say, in electrical and magnetic structures in liquid helium, or plasma, or perhaps something we're not yet aware of like dark matter or dark energy).\n\nOne possible solution to the Fermi paradox (if the universe is so big, where are the aliens?) might be that advanced civilizations inevitably move off of water-carbon substrates onto other more exotic ones as their technology advances, and that they then become unrecognizable/undetectable to us.",
                "The necessary biological habitat for life as we know it, i.e. earth-like life, requires these conditions...but that being said, who is to say that life hasn't evolved elsewhere to breathe methane gas or stay comfortable at 400 degrees?",
                "An interesting side-point I want to bring up: Another key factor in this discussion that's often overlookep is not the temperature range, but it's stability.\n\nIt's very unlikely that a single organism can survive in a highly variable temperature environment because the types of chemical reactions that occur will change at the ends of the spectrum. This ends up ruling out many planets without even requiring an explicit temperature range or elemental makeup on what kind of life we are looking.\n\nBecause of this, one major factor scientists have used to rule out potential life-inhabiting planets is whether their climates are stable. One of the major reasons that our climate is stable is actually the moon. This is the basis of a lot of rare-earth hypothesis logic (life is not abundant in the universe because the set of conditions on earth leading to life is actually very rare)",
                "Well organisms are known to live up to 100c on earth, so 40 certainly isn't the limit. I studied life in volcanic vents in grad school and the temp was 55-90 and was pretty full of life. \n\nIf you change pressure you could probably get above that, but once water boils you are a little screwed. \n\nProteins will degrade unless you have chaperones, but most extremophiles do.  DNA also denatures at high temps. ",
                "If I'm not mistaken this is totally possible. The reason we search for planets in the \"habitable\" zone that resembles earth is because we know for a fact that life succeeds there. In theory it could exist in other ways as well, but it would be sort of silly to search for something we don't even know how to identify in an area that may only be theoretically possible to sustain life. I believe NDT talked about this concept in one of his podcasts.\n\nI know that isn't your question exactly, but I'm guessing it's related.",
                "Life-as-we-know-it, i.e. based on the chemicals we are familiar with, can not. Simple physics and chemistry, how molecules interact with each other changes with temperature, substances change phase state, etc.\n\nLife based on [*something-else*] might, but we don't have a feasible test compounds to fill that blank with. at 5000 kelvin, well, titanium boils at 3560 K, so pretty much everything is a gas or plasma at 5000 Kelvin. Heck, the sun is 5,778 K, so we're talking fusion.\n\nOK, a star-environment.. for life to form here, you would need some sort of self-replicating pattern to be built out of fusion-hot plasma and intense magnetic fields. Well, I don't think we've proven it's *not* possible, but I also don't know of any proposed mechanism where it might be possible.\n\nin short, as far as we can tell, life requires it to be warm enough that things can change at an appropriate pace, cool enough for matter to congeal, and within a range that lets highly complex molecules form and interact in a giant variety. And that last bit is a subset of the first two requirements.",
                "There seems to be a lot of people suggesting that we can't make predictions about what life on another planet would like since we only know what can exist in Earth's environment.\n\nThis is NOT true though.  Assuming we are talking about chemically based self reproducing life, there are some assumptions we can make regardless of the environment. \n\n*The most common elements in the universe are Hydrogen, Helium, Oxygen, and Carbon.  This means life using other elements is significantly less likely to occur.\n\n *self replicating life requires atoms that can not only participate in complex and varied chemistry (in order to store information), but that are also stable relative to each other thermodynamically.  The prime example of this is carbon and silicon.  While both can form long chains and at least four bonds at a time, the Si-O bond is far more stable than an Si-Si bond.  This prevents information from being stored and passed down (imagine if your DNA switched itself around frequently).\n\n*In order for chemical processes to occur (necessary for life!) molecules have to come into contact with each other.  This is why a liquid solvent is so important!  Gas molecules do not come into contact with each other frequently enough, and solids do not allow for enough movement.  This puts hard limits on the temperature ranges allowable.  Liquid ammonia freezes at -78 C and Methane at -182.  Likewise, at even higher temperature most elements will form plasmas, which like gases are not likely to allow for significant molecular interactions.\n\n*Mechanical life is highly unlikely to evolve on its own.  By definition machines employ parts that are larger than a molecule, and the odds of mechanical parts coming together through the random fluctuations of the universe is astronomically small.\n\nWhile it is impossible to say definitively that other forms of life do not exist, we have very good reasons to believe that life will most likely be carbon and liquid based, and this is not being anthropocentric!  For those interested in reading more on the subject I recommend \"Astrobiology\" by Kevin Plaxco, he presents the information in an interesting and accessible way without dumbing it down.\n",
                "There are bacteria that live within thermal vents on the bottom of the ocean floor at a much higher temperature than what you're suggesting, and tardigrades in space living at temperatures much colder than what you're suggesting.  There is also not an 'infinite' point for heat, there is a limit for how hot something can get just as there is a limit to how cold something can get.",
                "5000K is the surface temperature of a star.. If there is life on the sun or any other star, it hasn't been detected or theorized yet.  The universe is a big place.\n\nPerhaps life does exist on other planets with extreme temperatures, such as Titan.  That would be exciting.",
                " > I am just wondering that in a scale of 0 Kelvin to infinite Kelvin, why are we alive at around 300 Kelvin? Could there be a planet with a temperature of 5000 Kelvin where there is (concsious) life in theory?\n\nSo, this is something that is difficult to answer because we do not know how conscious thought works.  We have many definitions for the idea of [consciousness](_URL_0_), none of which give us a basis to determine if other systems are conscious without their direct interaction.\n\nIn addition, the definitions we do have are many and frequently argued over, which creates many more problems.  For example, there are many people who would argue that many animals (and even computer software to a degree) posses sentience by some definitions (ability to differentiate between self and not self), but by other definitions are less clear (ability to use imagery and symbolism in the mind).",
                "I think the possibilities are as near to infinite as the stars.\n\nIt's awful human to think our kind of life is the only possible life.\n\nI wonder if there could be beings so hugely advanced and evolved that they've passed on to just some form of consciousness that doesn't even require a corporeal form. \n\nWhat about machines with artificial minds that have achieved sentience. What if they start making other machines like them? Is that life? Not organic life certainly but still.\n\nThe fun thing about speculation like this is that pretty much anything is possible. Physics as we know it may place limitations but do we understand it ALL? I doubt it. I think we're still monkeys.",
                "The first step to answer this question is to define 'life'.  DNA based life is what exists on this planet.  \nYou can find the theoretical range for DNA based life by using the temperatures not too hot for DNA to exist but warm enough for DNA to activate.   \n\nHowever if you use the definition of life as \"capacity for growth, reproduction, functional activity, and continual change preceding death.\"  Then you do have a near limitless theoretical range.  \n\nYou could have plant sized creatures that live in the near zero temperatures of deep space.  They float along catching material with their gravitational well and produce needed heat internally.  They could have life spans of eons.  \n\nYou could have organisms made of some type of complex interaction of plasma that can only live in the temperatures found on stars.  These might have life spans ranging from nano to micro seconds as the form new entities even as they spin apart.  Once you open up your definition of life all these things are theoretically possible. ",
                "There is no way to negate any temperature range with certainty.\n\nIn the infinite possibility that is our universe, there is a strong likelihood that anything you can conceive of exists in some form.\n\nConsider it Rule 34 of space: if you thought about it, it could exist.\n\nMarvel comics included beings that were entire planets - is that impossible?  No - it's not likely; but, not impossible.",
                "We don't have empirical data on non-carbon based lifeforms (obviously). Your question turns on two things (1) what is the meaning of \"conscious life\", and (2) what chemical environments are sufficient for the emergence of conscious life.\n\nIt seems that \"life\" can be most broadly understood as persistent and self-replicating patterns in a chemical substrate. We need a stew of chemicals that allows patterns to form that can use energy to maintain themselves and to make copies of themselves.\n\nConsciousness is probably best thought of in terms as goal directed information processing about states internal or external to an orgaism. The simplest things that count as \"life\" are probably not conscious in this sense. Self-replicating macromolecules are on the borderline of \"life\". They don't do any information processing.\n\nBoth of these requirements can be met by chemical substrates other than carbon-based ones. Silicon works, in theory.\n\nThe question of \"why are we alive at around 300 Kelvin\" can be best answered from a chemical perspective. This is the temperature at which the stew of chemicals here performs in the right way to form self-replicating chemical structures (life). It is similar to asking why we need a certain temperature to have sulfuric acid rain on venus. It is a physical phenomenon and counts on certain conditions."

                "Maria Theresa promoted a technical education for her more talented subjects, to replace amateurs in government service with professional civil servants, to better solve economic problems and so that the law might function better. And for the sake of efficient policing, she maintained the practice of torture.\n\nShe was devoted to the welfare of all her law-abiding subjects – in addition to being a devoted mother to her sixteen children. And her subjects returned that devotion. She welcomed the new public health service which was associated with the University of Vienna. She was a devout Catholic, but sought to limit the Papal political influence in her realm, and she moved to bring the Church under an increasing government control, while the Church held onto its lands and the serfs upon those lands. The Church continued to do those things that Maria Theresa believed in: organizing relief for the poor and other welfare services, running the hospitals and the judiciary. The Church continued to run the schools, including universities, and to dominate intellectual life through censorship and its ownership of newspapers.\n\nMaria Theresa approved of an elementary and intermediate education for unexceptional common people that did not subvert traditional values. She wished simple people to be left with their simple faith. One of her ministers described the only purpose in schooling common children as giving them a horror of theft, lying, drunkenness, ingratitude and other vices. Maria Theresa's husband, Francis Stephen, died in 1765 when she was forty-eight. She cut her hair and grieved for years, while sharing power with first her son, Joseph, who as Joseph II succeeded her husband as titular head of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1780 Maria Theresa died, and Joseph II began liberalizing his government. He allowed faiths other than Roman Catholic to construct churches and schools. He abolished the death penalty and torture for extracting confessions. He allowed marriage by purely civil contract. He freed peasants from feudal dues, allowed them to marry whom they pleased and to buy land from their former lords at modest fee. Concerned about doing good he built orphanages, hospitals and parks. His reforms were resisted in Hungary and the Austrian Netherlands. And after he died in 1790 his successor, and brother, Leopold II, began to water down and sometimes cancel his reforms.\n\n____________________________________________________________\n\nCatherine II considered herself enlightened. She corresponded with learned men, including Voltaire. She wished to be a \"defender of oppressed innocence,\" to spread education and to otherwise reform Russia. She exercised her authority over the Eastern Orthodox Church – which owned one-third of Russia's agricultural land and one-third of its serfs. Catherine confiscated much of its lands and left the church's clergy as state paid functionaries.\n\nCatherine gave up wanting to create an \"enlightened\" constitution and political reforms. Wanting to keep all of her power, she joined others in believing that absolute monarchy was the best form of government – best, she believed, when done properly. Russian society appeared to her too chaotic for any sharing of power. But she knew that to rule she had to have the support of a segment of society that had a collective power of sorts, and to this end she tried to please the nobility. She released them from the obligation to serve the state that had been imposed on the nobility by Ivan the Terrible. She extended the nobility's power over the people living on and working their lands. Under her rule, serfdom was extended to over a million people who had previously been freed.\n\nFailing at reform that benefited common people, Catherine sought distraction for her subjects in the grandeur of imperial expansion. She sought to expand Russian rule to the Black Sea and to Constantinople, to return Christianity there, and to free Moldavia and Walachia from the Ottomans. Already she had expanded her influence in Poland, with the support of her new ally, Frederick the Great. After Augustus III of Saxony and Poland had died (in 1763), she installed as king of Poland one of her lovers, Stanislaus Poniatovski, who became Stanislaus II, Catherine believing that his lack of qualifications for that honor would make him all the more grateful for his appointment, and therefore more subservient.\n\nIn 1768, Catherine's army pushed southwest from the Dnieper River into the Balkans, scoring victories and calling on Christians to join them against the Ottomans. Another Russian force invaded and captured the Crimea. A Russian fleet sailed from the Baltic Sea through the Strait of Gibraltar and into Ottoman waters in the Aegean Sea where, on July 6, 1770, near the island of Chios, they sank the Turkish navy.\n\nThe Russian fleet was unable to do more for the Russian effort following this victory. The war on land was bogged down, and the Christians in Ottoman lands had failed to join the Russians. Austria was concerned about Russian expansion into the Balkans. To allay the hostility of the Habsburgs, Frederick, who was allied with the Russians, organized an agreement with Russia and Joseph II of Austria. The three of them were to take lands from Poland. Maria Theresa had always gone to war for territory that she believed was hers – namely Silesia – and she objected to her son taking land that did not belong by tradition to the Habsburgs. But her son, Joseph, had no such objection. In what became known as the First Partition of Poland, in 1772, the Habsburgs extended their rule into Galacia, Brandenburg-Prussia received land between Pomerania with East Prussia – except for the port city of Danzig, and Russia expanded to the W. Dvina River (near the port city of Riga) and to the Dnieper River, halfway to the city of Minsk, adding 1.3 million subjects to Catherine's rule.\n\nAfter the death of the Ottoman Sultan, Mustafa, in July 1774, Ottoman resistance to the Russians weakened, and the Ottomans were ready to settle with the Russians. Catherine was facing a peasant uprising that had begun among Cossacks in the Ural River region, led by Emelian Pugachev. The rising spread to serfs, miners in the Urals, factory workers, Bashkirs, Tatars and other minorities within Russia, and to those Christians called Old Believers, and the revolt was threatening Moscow. Catherine settled with the Ottomans. By the Treaty of Kuchuk Kainarji, Russia received full possession of Azov and land south to the Kuban River; Russia's border shifted westward to the Dnieper River; Russia acquired land on the coast of the Black Sea; and it acquired a right of passage through the straits by Constantinople into the Mediterranean. The treaty proclaimed the Tatars of the Crimea autonomous within the Ottoman Empire. And Moldavia and Walachia remained within the Ottoman Empire.\n\nCatherine sent troops released from the war against the peasant revolt. Landlords, government officials and army officers eagerly supported Catherine, and Catherine's army easily defeated the uncoordinated rebel armies. Pugachev was brought to Moscow in chains and executed in public in an especially cruel fashion.\n\nIn 1783 – three years after Maria Theresa's death at the age of sixty-three - Catherine annexed the Crimea, and many of the Crimea's Tatars fled to Ottoman territory. That year, Irakli II of Georgia allied his multi-national state with Russia, Irakli acknowledging Russian suzerainty and Russia guaranteeing Georgian independence.\n\nIn 1786 – the year that Frederick died – Mozart's comic opera about oppression, The Marriage of Figaro, appeared. Three years later came the French Revolution. And two years after that, in the year of his death, at age thirty-five, came Mozart's other comic opera about oppression: The Magic Flute.\n\nThe revolution that swept France frightened Catherine, and she turned against intellectuals in Russia who sympathized with the revolution. After the executions of Louis XVI and his wife, Marie Antoinette (daughter of Maria Theresa) in 1793, Catherine broke off relations with France, proclaimed six weeks of mourning and welcomed refugees from France.\n\nAlso in 1793, Catherine, Joseph of Austria, and Frederick's nephew – Frederick William II – took advantage of the turmoil in France to confiscate more Polish lands, in what was called the Second Partition of Poland. In 1794 a national uprising by the Poles was crushed by the Russians, and, in 1795, Russia, Austria and Brandenburg-Prussia participated in what was to be known as the Third Partition of Poland. Brandenburg-Prussia took Warsaw, the Habsburgs took Krakow and expanded northward along the banks of the Bug River, and Catherine took Courland, Brest-Litovsk and what was left of Poland.\n\nCatherine was opposed to educating common people, believing that if the uneducated were educated they would stop obeying.\n\n\nALL IN ALL I believe even though Catherine was more authoritative in nature... I feel she contributed more to Russia"

Then there's turning which is a big deal on a motorcycle, you start on the outside of the turn and move Inward and then back outside.

                "Adding to the other reasons given, it provides an escape route in case people in front slam on the brakes.  People often think bikes but brake faster than cars because they accelerate so fast.  The opposite is actually true, bikes essentially depend of the tiny contact patch of their front wheel for almost 100% of their braking because all of the weight ends up on that wheel.  So much so that using the rear brake too much can cause that tire to lock up and unsettle the bike.  Because of that, bikes actually brake slower than most cars, but it is trivial to fit through the wide gaps in between cars (and in most places around the world, completely legal to do so in any situation).  It is usually easier to avoid an accident by swerving out of the way of it than by hard braking.  To add to that, if someone from behind comes up too fast and is probably going to rear end the bike, it helps the biker avoid getting squished.\n\n & #x200B;\n\n & #x200B;",
                "Motorcycle instructor here:\n\nThere are several reasons.\n\nFirst, visibility. The rider is able to see traffic much better when riding at one edge or the other of a lane rather than the middle. Furthermore, other traffic is able to see the rider much better when the rider is closer to the edge of the lane, as they are more visible to oncoming traffic (which is why you'll generally see the rider on the *left* side of the lane on a two lane road in a country where the people drive on the right). This is true for mirror visibility and avoiding blind spots as well as direct visibility.\n\nSecond, traction. The best traction available in the lane is in the tire tracks of where car and truck tires typically go. The grease and oil drippings collect in the center, meaning significantly less traction there. Debris, gravel, and garbage collect on the edges, again affecting traction.\n\nThird, lane dominance. Riding in the center or the incorrect edge of the lane encourages selfish drivers to attempt to share the lane and use the perceived 'extra' real estate to pass a slower driver. This is dangerous.\n",
                "Motorcyclists break a car's single lane into 3 lanes: left, middle, and right. The lane chosen for riding is typically chosen based on a combination of safety factors, primarily on the condition of road, and then visibility to other vehicles.",
                "2 main reasons for me:\n\n* slick stains from car drippings (oil, etc) are usually center 3 feet of lane.   Riding off-center avoids that area.  \n* better line of sight around cars ahead of me.  \n\n\n\n\n",
                "As an avid rider, there's a couple reasons.\n\n1) the road surface isn't perfect and over time the wheels of cars form two grooves, or \"ruts\" that are clean and grip well. We like to ride in these for traction, as all the road grime collects in the center and poses a hazard when the road is wet. \n\n2) when we approach a stop, it's not uncommon for us to get rear ended since our narrow profile makes it hard to judge our distance if you're not paying attention. By staying on the edge of the lane, it's possible to avoid being rear ended, even if just by an inch. Theres a video about this Wich I'll link if I find it \n\n3) we can better assess traffic ahead of us and plan escape routes, etc. We take advantage of being able to do this, so that when were in a bad spot, we can easily get out.

                "Hi, Rider here. \n\nThere are a few things probably adding up to this\n\n1. Simply put, many of us don't. But I recognize that assholes are the most effective ambassadors. One bad rider can form an impression. \n2. There's a cultural element *cough cough Harley douches* who like to do a bit of bullying and ride literally on the line. \n3. Most of us will occupy the left side or right side of a lane — but still well within the lane itself — in order to stay visible in mirrors or prepare for a pass.\n\nThe main thing car and motorcycle riders should all remember is that safety on the road is a shared currency and that traffic works when its predictable.",

                "I'm a motorcyclist of 20 years from central Sydney, Australia (ie, I ride in a city with a decent amount of traffic)\n\nThere are two reasons to stay out of the centreline. One is that the centre of the road doesn't get swept of debris. Cars drop things like oil near the middle, and car tyres can help clear sand, oil, nails and screws, and so on, so for the most part you want to try to ride in the wheel track of the cars. The other is that from the edges of the lane you can see further ahead, and your are more visible to other traffic. (There is a third reason, which is to make sure cars don't try to take part of your lane away from you, but that one is very situational and hard to phrase as a principle.)\n\nEither the left or right wheel track will do, so how do you pick? You pick based on the situation at the time. The golden rule is to maintain as much space as you can from the hazards around you. If there are many hazards, stay away from the biggest hazard. Space means potentially avoiding the problem without having to take any action, and if not, space = time, and time = time to react if necessary.\n\nSo, examples (using left-lane driving, per Australian rules. For the USA, invert everything).\n\nWhen on a road with one lane each way, stay in the right hand wheel track when there are no oncoming vehicles. This puts you far away from both curbs. If there's nothing else happening on the road, the curb is the biggest risk. Kids, or dogs, or inattentive adults on phones might jump out from behind some vision obstacle like a tree or bus stop. And even the curb itself is a hazard. It's something you can possibly hit which is fast relative to you. A gust of wind might blow you towards it, and if your tyre hits it, that's bad. \n\nIf there are oncoming vehicles, stay in the left hand wheel track. Oncoming vehicles are a bigger hazard to you than the curb. They hit hard, and they are travelling much faster relative to you than the curb is. A person on their phone might drift into your lane.\n\nIf there are occasional oncoming vehicles, move into the left wheel track while they pass, and move back into the right wheel track after they have passed.\n\nIf there an intersecting road on the left, move into the right wheel track. You can see further into the joining road, and if someone starts to pull out you have more space. If it's on the right, stay in the left wheel track.\n\nIf you're stopped at the lights in the right lane, stay in the left wheel track. People turning right from your left might cut the corner.\n\nSometimes the rule of space = time overrides the wheel track rule, and you want to stay in the centre. Your safety gets priority over avoiding punctures. So if there are big trucks on both sides of you, stay in the middle. If the lanes are narrow and the right wheel track takes you too close to the centreline, but there are hazards on the left, then the middle might be the best choice.\n\nExactly what to do in any specific situation is a judgement call, and the right judgement comes with experience. But these are the principles. Avoid debris and oil, stay visible, give yourself space.\n",
                "You presume they care. They don't. They ride around  damaging hearing and waking people up. ",
                "I do it because 1) it's easier for cars and trucks to see me in their mirror. 2) it's easier for me to see down the line of traffic and filter at the lights 3) there's less chance of debris/oil on the road where the cars have been, in the middle you can get oil and rocks ",
                "Another thing to consider is if there's something in the middle of the road, like a board, many times a car will straddle it instead of moving over, but it can be dangerous for a bike to go over it. By riding on one side, a bike will have time to react if the car in front of them swerves to miss the object instead of just driving over it.",
                "Because they hate themselves as much as everyone else hates them.  They just lack the courage to dive left into traffic.  Seriously, what kind of pos tunes his exhaust pipe for maximum volume and then drives thru peoples' neighborhoods?  Awful people, that's who.",
                "And when they stop behind you at a light and get right up to your bumper and they're way over on one side of the lane or the other it's so that you can see them and in case somebody is about to crash into you they can scoot out of the way so they don't become sandwiched I between cars.

                "I haven't read all the comments, but the lanes where the car tires run are often smoother and very cleaner than the the middle. You don't notice it in a car, but there is often sand on the road and it gathers in between the \"wheel ruts\". It's not enough (usually) to be anything but minor annoyance, but it's there. \n\nThe primary reason is safety and safety on a motorcycle is all about visibility.",
                "The center of the lane is where the oil and other muck is.  Riding where car tires go is the safest place to be. ",
                "I just go with the 2/3 rule whenever possible. If you divide the lane into three lanes in your mind just stay at the edge of the second one right on the border of 3. Because especially if you're driving in the South where there's a lot of sand wash out, you want to stay away from the white line just as much as you want to stay away from the yellow one.",

It’s better to have the immediate forward view as clear as possible. So offsetting your group gives that bit better view. You can also see what multiple riders are doing and where they are looking at any one time. \n\n2: Braking space. If the riders in front are forced to brake suddenly then first of all you’ll notice multiple brake lights in a staggered pattern. Also you can brake and “slot” into a gap more easily. Rather than arse-ram the rider in ftont. ",
                "Not gonna dig through all the replies, but there are actually three lanes for motorcycles for every car lane. Think of em divided by thirds. Generally, the middle of the lane is no bueno cause that's where the worst car visibility is, and all the engines drip their oil there. As for the right or left side of the lane, it really depends on traffic and visibility. If you are coming up on a busy intersection, where people make lots of right hand turns from the intersecting road, it may be a good idea to move over to the right so the cars taking a right don't think there is a gap and plow into you. Vice versa, if there is a left hand turn from oncoming traffic, you want the cars to see you are there before they decide to take the left turn right into you.\n\nA book I read when I started riding explained it like this:\n\nUse lane positioning to try and make yourself as visible as a semi, but always remember, you have to pretend at the same time you are the bicyclist on the road. What that means is try to make yourself super visible, but always remember not everyone will look out for you and be prepared for ensuring you have safe plans for quick reaction to the car drivers.",
                "sp oncoming traffic can see them, also not in the middle because that is where most oil, coolants, lubricants drip from cars and could cause slippery conditions",
                "In addition, automobile drivers frequently do not swerve around debris in the road.  You can be a few car lengths back in the middle, unable to see around the car in front of you, when a board or strip of semi tire or other exciting obstacle suddenly pops out in front of you with absolutely no warning whatsoever,",
                "Sometimes I do when there's a van in front of me with no windows in back. I need them to see me in the side mirror. I've literally been backed over before. I don't know why the person decided to start backing up, but we were in tight traffic, and I had nowhere to go. I was on the horn but they just kept backing up. So I just bailed and watched them back over my bike. It was a fun time. Probably goes with reason #1 in the top comment.",
                "In addition to everything here I would also like to add that motorcycles stay closer to the opposite lane because of people getting in and out of parked cars. Getting clotheslined by a car door wouldn't be fun.",
                "If you can't see their mirror, they can't see you.  \n\n\nAlso keeps people from going \"it's free real estate!\" and running you into the curb.  \n\n\nalso less potholes",
                "Those poor souls trapped in a cage, made to separate them from the world. Their cages leak fluids.\n\nYou'll really know it when you come to a expansion joint or bump in the road and see a dark spot in the center of a lane. That's all the grease and oil dripping from the cages.\n\nMotorcyclists try to ride in the tire tracks of cages where it's cleanest on the road. \n\nThere may also be thoughtful reasons for this, that they're saving room for a second motorcyclist to share the lane. \n\nOther reason is that back window are sometimes tinted. As a rider, I can follow the head movement of a cager better in their sideview mirrors and predict when they want to attempt murder (I mean switch lanes when my motorcycle is beside them.)"

Roughly speaking if they make 5% profit they are doing very well, quite a few companies have been making a loss recently (hence price rises).\nThe wholesale side is where the money is, but its not a cheap thing to be in to, finding oil and gas is only going to get more expensive. Renewable sources (like wind and solar) are not cost efficient.\n\nNationalising the retail side is pretty pointless, they'd still be at the mercy of the wholesalers. If you did the whole lot I guess it would be more worth it but given the way the country works we'd end up with a huge public sector to run it all, more inefficiently than private companies would. I reckon it'd cost more to run in the public sector.\n\nI guess it would be possible for the government to force a compulsory purchase, whilst I don't think the EU would prevent it they may not be happy with regard to the loss of trade (many of our energy companies are owned by EU companies, in some cases those companies are owned by foreign states, for example EDF is French state owned).\n\nI would guess that if it were to be re-nationalised end consumers would end up paying even higher prices, partly because of the way it'd be run but also to service the massive debt taken on by the government to buy it back."

                "/u/hillsonghoods has [an utterly awesome answer](_URL_0_) about the history of \"Y.M.C.A\" that addresses your specific question at the end.",
                "[A 12\" remix of a previous answer](_URL_1_): \n\nIn a [2008 oral history of 'YMCA' in Spin magazine](_URL_2_), members of the Village People and one of their producers, Henri Belolo, explain the genesis of the song. According to David Hodo (the construction worker in the Village People): \n\n >  It was 1977, and we were leaving a photography session on 23rd Street. Jacques Morali saw the big pink YMCA on 23rd and asked, “What is this YMCA, anyway? “And after laughing at his accent, we told him the Y was a place where you could go when you first came to New York when you didn’t have any money — you can stay there for very little. And of course, someone joked, “Yeah, but don’t bend over in the showers. “And Jacques, bless his heart, said, “I will write a song about this!”\n\nThe Jacques mentioned by Hodo is Jacques Morali, a French producer who was the (co-)writer and producer of all of the Village People's biggest hits; Morali was gay, and sadly passed away in 1991 from AIDS. \n\nIn the group itself, there was a mix of sexualities in the Village People, with some members identifying as straight, some being ambiguous in print about it, and some identifying as gay. For instance, another member of the Village People - Victor Willis, the lead singer of 'YMCA' - is notable for being quite insistent that he is heterosexual; he married the actress who played Clair Huxtable on the *Cosby Show*. Willis has a co-write on the song, and Randy Jones (the cowboy in the Village People) says in the Spin oral history that: \n\n > It was not intended as a gay anthem. Do you have the lyrics in front of you? There’s nothing gay about them. I think Victor wrote the words, but it’s all a big fucking mystery. The guy who really deserves the credit is Horace Ott, who arranged the horns and strings. Jacques had the ideas, but Horace transformed them into songs.\n\nIn contrast, Hodo says in the same article that : \n\n > “Y.M.C.A.” certainly has a gay origin. That’s what Jacques was thinking when he wrote it, because our first album [1977’s Village People] was possibly the gayest album ever. I mean, look at us. We were a gay group. So was the song written to celebrate gay men at the YMCA? Yes. Absolutely. And gay people love it.\n\nAccording to a [2013 analysis of the song and the relationship between the YMCA and 1970s gay culture in *The Believer* by Nicole Pasulka](_URL_3_): \n\n > At the Y, a spiritual man was a well-built, muscular man. The organization’s leadership positioned the regional branches as destinations that could protect newcomers from “negative” influences. It was here that many young guys had their first homosexual experiences. So Jacques Morali and Randy Jones were part of a history that included both diligent Christian bodybuilders and men cruising for “trade”—straight-identified, masculine men. \n\nPasulka and the Spin oral history both portray the YMCA as a place with an official anti-homosexuality policy, but a culture where homosexuality was often common. Pasulka also portrays the YMCA culture as becoming less gay towards the end of the 1970s, and becoming closer to mainstream culture, comparing it to the Village People's acceptance by the mainstream. \n\nBy all accounts, in a world where much of gay culture was very underground, the fairly obvious gay subtext of the Village People to modern viewers was less obvious at the time to the mainstream - there wasn't much public knowledge about what Pasulka calls 'clone culture'; gay stereotypes at the time were very feminised. In contrast to the feminised stereotype, the Village People cast a knowing look at heterosexual masculine stereotypes with their choice of dress - cowboys, construction workers, etc - and the knowing look was missed by a lot of the mainstream at the time. This meant that the Village People could deny the gay subtext was there when they felt it was appropriate - and for Victor Willis who may have written some or all of the lyrics, there really might have been no gay subtext.\n\nAccording to contemporary reports, the YMCA floated suing the Village People for defamation because of the implications of homosexuality, but didn't go through it - in the context of 'clone culture' etc, and Willis's denials of homosexuality it would have been quite awkward to prove. In contrast, the YMCA is now more relaxed about the gay overtones; their media relations manager said to Spin in 2008 that \"We at the YMCA celebrate the song. It’s a positive statement about the YMCA and what we offer to people all around the world.\"\n\nAs to why a room full of 13 year olds at a church gathering would enthusiastically dance to the song in later decades, the Spin oral history notes that, by the 1990s, the song began to be used in sports settings in America, encouraged by team managers and the like who thought the song would be a crowd pleaser. According to, for instance, the director of stadium operations at the Brevard County Manatees: \n\n > There are a handful of songs that just make you get up and dance. At our ballpark, “Y.M.C.A.” has to be considered one of them. “Y.M.C.A.” is a gay song? Honestly, I had no clue.\n\n'YMCA' certainly isn't the only song with an origin in or links to gay subculture which has become a successful sports song; Queen's 'We Will Rock You/We Are The Champions' and Frankie Goes To Hollywood's 'Relax' both come to mind. Perhaps there is a story there about the cluelessness of most sporting people around the cultural clues surrounding music; things that are very obvious to people who are engaged in the culture of pop music often slide past the heads of people who are much less engaged in that culture. \n\nBut of course, pop music by its very nature is there to be *used*, and the people who make pop music generally hope for it to appeal to as big an audience as possible. Whether Hodo's claims about Morali's inspiration for the song are accurate, Morali very clearly produced the song to be a commercial hit. And to be popular, pop music generally has to provide something useful to more than one group of people, as there are always different groups in society who are consuming pop music; songs without a mass appeal amongst different demographics tend to not have...mass appeal. \n\n'YMCA' has - and has always had -  a multitude of uses beyond 'celebrating the closeted homosexual interactions occurring in ~~1960's~~ 1970s Christian gymnasiums'. It would never have gotten to #1 (in the UK, Canada, Australia, and much of Europe) or #2 (in the US) if that was its sole purpose - at least some of the places where it was successful would not have understood the meaning of 'YMCA', let alone the overtones of sexuality. After all, the song is very danceable, with a four-to-the-floor disco beat that works very effectively. It has easily replicable dance moves that are fun to do. It's clearly catchy. Victor Willis's vocal performance is strong in a soul shouter kind of way. The costumes of the group are memorable and their dancing is interesting to look at when you see the video. It also fit squarely within an extremely popular genre - disco - [which dominated the airwaves and the charts in the late 1970s, to the discontent of the rock audience shouting 'disco sucks'](_URL_0_). It's entirely unsurprising that it was a worldwide success in 1978.\n\nPeter Shapiro's book *Turn The Beat Around: The Secret History Of Disco* claims that the Village People were:\n\n > practically *personae non grata* in the gay clubs. Instead, the Village People got most of their play at aerobics classes for senior citizens who could perform the accompnaying dance to 'YMCA' without taxing their bodies too much, at barbecues by car mechanics who thought 'YMCA' was about playing basketball, at strait-laced high school proms in Kansas and at children's playgroups. It was Middle America that took the Village People close to its bosom\".\n\nThe Village People, in some ways, have stayed in public consciousness as an avatar of the cheesiness of late 1970s disco - disco has a reputation for cheese, and the Village People were pretty cheesy even for disco. Peter Shapiro's *Turn The Beat Around: The Secret History Of Disco* is scathing about the group: \"if disco had a nadir it was unquestionably the Village People. The Village People represented everything naff about disco: the stale beats seemingly phoned in by studio hacks, the dunderheaded English-as-a-foreign-language lyrics, the complete lack of subtletly, all delivered by [a bunch of stereotypes]\". Shapiro, of course, is attempting to rehabilitate the critical opinion about disco in this book, to explain its import and meaning, and he is intent on showing that disco had a smarter, more cosmopolitan side than you see in the Village People. Nonetheless, he also admits that - even if they're a harmless novelty act - the Village People have a 'goofy pleasure'. And who can deny some harmless goofy pleasures to a bunch of 13-year-olds?"

                "It’s hard to answer this question academically because, as you say, there’s just not a lot of people that work on Cyprus (the entire island only has around 800,000 people). \n\nAlthough the origins of the presence of Turks on the island has its roots in land grants given to mainlanders by the ottomans after the conquest of the island in the 16th century, there is a distinct Turkish Cypriot identity among Turkish Cypriots, as there is a Greek Cypriot identity. Both groups consider themselves distinct from being either Turkish (=of the republic of Turkey) and Greek (= of the Hellenic Republic). However, they are also slightly different from one another, in that people specifically identify as a Greek- or Turkish Cypriot (as opposed to just being Cypriot). There are/were also small groups of Armenians and Maronites (from Lebanon) on the island; both groups are small (less than 1000 people) and now in the south (Greek Cyprus).\n\nThere are now more Turkish Cypriots living outside of Cyprus than on the island—around half a million in Turkey, a quarter million in the UK, and a number in Australia, as opposed to under 150,000 inhabitants of northern Cyprus. In response to the outmigration, the Turkish government encouraged mainland settlers to move to Northern Cyprus after 1974. Many of these were rural, conservative Muslims from eastern Turkey, and there is a general feeling of resentment toward them by Turkish Cypriots, whose culture generally was more secular and distinct from the mainland. There is a general feeling among Turkish Cypriots that the settlers are hastening the decline of Turkish Cypriot culture and language.\n\nThis is particularly the case with language: Cypriot Turkish has many distinct features not shared by mainland Turkish, both through its prolonged contact with Cypriot Greek, and through the language reforms that standard (mainland) Turkish went through in the early days of the republic. In both cases, Cypriots can understand the standard dialect of Turkish or Greek, but usually have to switch to the standard variety in order to make themselves understood by people from Turkey or Greece (this is especially the case with people who come from villages in the Troodos mountains, in which each seems to have its own regional dialect).\n\nCyprus, as you probably know, has had a troubled history for most of the 20th century. Inter-communal fighting persisted from the period before independence in 1960 through to the Turkish invasion of 1974, and finding a solution agreeable to both sides has been difficult — negotiations are still ongoing. There is still a bit of animosity and distrust between the populations given the history of modern violence—especially distrust. One of the sticking points is that Greek Cyprus wants the Turkish military off the island because they don’t trust Turkey, and the Turkish Cypriots are reluctant to be without any protection as they remember when the Cypriot military essentially behaved as a Greek paramilitary force in the 1960s.\n\nIt’s anecdotal, but I found that the older generation who remembers life before 1974 to be somewhat softer in their attitudes as opposed to the younger generation who grew up only hearing stories about the violence and thinking of the other side as the enemy. (Full disclosure: I was on Cyprus for a seminar in 2004, which was only about 18 months after it became possible to cross the green line. Things may have changed as there’s now been much more direct contact between Greek and Turkish Cypriots since that happened; I haven’t been back since then). \n\nUnfortunately, there’s not a lot out there that’s about the Cypriot people, as opposed to the conflict, but you can try Papadakis, Yiannis (2005), *Echoes from the Dead Zone: Across the Cyprus divide*, I.B.Tauris, 2005."

                " First, what do you mean by holding responsible? What consequences do you suggest to the US should face, and from whom?\n\nSecond, although the US has caused many recent problems, the instability in the region dates back at least to the end of World War I, when Great Britain decided to divide the region up in ways that didn't make any sense. Further instability  was caused by the  collapse of the Soviet Union. And recent instability has been made worse by drought, which has increased poverty in some areas. ",
                "Because it's so much more complicated than that. By that logic, France should be held accountable for Hitler, since it was their outrageous reparation demands that bankrupted Germany after WWI and created the political environment that allowed Hitler to rise to power. Should France be held responsible for the holocaust? No. France may have created the metaphorical gun, but it was Germany that took it and pulled the trigger.\n\nLikewise, the US did not create ISIS. We certainly helped to create the political climate to allow its creation *recently*, but it is the extremists who took the opportunity to do so, and the other nearby nations like Saudi Arabia that failed to take action against extremism within their borders to prevent it.\n\nThe middle east hasn't been \"stable\" in hundreds of years. The US definitely has not been helpful at times, but there are far more factors and far more players. Should we be culpable for the negative effects of our presence there? Yeah. But we've had positive influences as well. I'm not trying to hand-wave the bad away and excuse or actions, but neither is it fair to say the situation there is the fault of the US.",

My friend calls me to come hang out with them and screw the person who bailed on our date, but I don't go out at night because my fist hurts.\n\nOr this case: My date bails, I don't punch a wall. My friend calls me to come hang out with them and screw the person who bailed on our date, I go out with them and meet the girl of my dreams.\n\nWe don't know other possibilities.

The heater is just a very nice side effect.  \n\nAlso consider the materials involved, and the quantity.  Your car engine is over a thousand pounds of metal.  If you're interested in using the heater, it's probably cold outside, so that's over a thousand pounds of very cold metal.  As mentioned previously, heating is just a side effect, so all of that metal needs to warm up first before the heat will pass to you.  The hairdryer, by comparison, is a tiny little scrap of metal, in a plastic shell.  Heating that up is much much easier than heating up an engine block."

It would not be viable to run tracks from (say) Rooty Hill to Parramatta, as the ridership would be so low.\n\n",
                "Cities still invest in highways for public cars, and that's obviously more expensive and less efficient than either light rail or bus lanes. Much of the decisions cities make are responding to consumer demand so they get voted in next election, rather than making the best decision.\n\nOne thing I will mention is that electric buses aren't much of a thing yet, but light rail is electrified, so offers an advantage in combating inner city air pollution.\n\n",
                "It's easier to get middle-class people to ride trains than it is to get them on busses.  They tend to think that busses are for poor people while light rail makes them sophisticated urbanites.",
                "Modern light rail can be automated.  Initially, the light rail system would be human operated.  Once all systems are up and working, the system can be easily automated.  There is less wear and tear on light rail vehicles.  Unlike busses, light rail is not necessarily affected by traffic as with all trains, they have the right of way in many places.  While in many other areas, the light rail system will share intersecting areas with traffic lights to allow an equal number of vehicles per train to pass.",
                "Light rail and dedicated buses each serve a specific need. Light rail serves the need of a heavily populated area in that it can move a large volume of people cost-effectively. Dedicated buses serve the need of the areas beyond the area served by light rail and in many cases extend the reach of light rail. It isn't a this or that situation, but rather an integrated system of rail and bus that form various transportation hubs based on commuter demands.",
                "Light rail has a much higher passenger carrying capacity, both in terms of how many fit on a segment of train cars, and how many train cars can run the same circuit. For a large city, light rail moves more people more often.\n\nThere are more nebulous long-vision issues that could be at play such as getting people out of their cars to reduce pollution, reduce traffic congestion (lessen the unending need to continue expanding the capacity of the road system etc.), reduce vehicular accidents, etc.",
                "Sex appeal.  If you're a public transportation booster, then Light Rail is the new and sexy thing.  Bus Rapid Transit is typically less expensive, even over the long run, and far more flexible.  But, it's a lot easier to convince voters to back a light rail system than to buy more buses.",

                "Although some of these explanations are good about the \"shutting down\" websites and services. However, I'll go off on a tangent as they aren't really explaining why it looks easy to hack. Simply put, it's not easy. It's about finding flaws in *human* written code. Seeing as humans are either lazy or faulty at best (if not both). A lot of times hackers can simply try different tricks on a lot of sites and eventually they'll succeed. Once they succeed to gain access, they act super confident and pretend they knew exactly what they are doing. That is to scare companies and people as to show that they have power, this may make it seem like it is easy as that's what the media sees. \n\nA DDOS (Distributed denial of service) as it is called, is when you simply force a lot of traffic onto a connection so it has a hard time handling all the individual requests. It is really not that hard to do if you got access to some tools and a lot of computers at your disposal (who are being controlled by viruses for example, known as a bot net). These attacks usually will not last very long and therefore aren't considered very effective.\n\nThey can use these tools and as the media don't know the difference between an effective and a non-effective (ex. DDOS) attack, they just front page that a site has been hacked.\n\nAlso a slightly important side-note is that it's easy to overestimate security on sites.  \nReally, if you've been studying to become a programmer, you might expect a project to look really complex and organised, but then you join a company and see a really bad mess of code which no one can be bothered to fix and there in a lot of security errors might be... *Have you ever seen a legacy project?*\n\nEdit: Please comment if there is something you don't understand.

(Shit I *just* had that 'holy fucking Christ i'm an adult' moment...weird....aaaaanway) \n\nFirstly, I got a lot of positive feedback on a post that tried to [explain 'hacking' to the layman](_URL_0_), so I think that might give you a good frame of mind to start with. It doesn't answer your question but it might give you a clearer idea about 'hacking' \n\n\nSo, the basic answer to your question is two-fold, firstly, basically every modern system has bugs and vulnerabilities: \n\n* It is *incredibly difficult* to demonstrably, provably write bug-free code, even on a relatively small scale. \n\n* Very, *very* few systems are built from the ground up - they depend on other technologies, layers, frameworks - even simple systems are built on top of other technologies/frameworks/environments so complex that it takes incredibly skilled software engineers to just know the jist of what each piece is, does and how it works. The average joe engineer can easily take actions which have consequences he doesn't see, and can't possibly know about. \n\n* Creating a security vulnerability just requires one engineer, building one tiny aspect of one tiny piece of one massive, incredibly deep system to slip up - which is very easy to do for even a very good developer, as explained above. \n\n* Basically, security vulnerabilities are almost inevitable in non-trivial systems. \n\nSecondly, one side is just more motivated: \n\n* Finding and exploiting one of these vulnerabilities potentially  means millions of dollars of easy, tax free profit for an attacker....finding an repairing these vulnerabilities is just a day in the office for a developer - 'We need to be better every single day, they just need to be better once' as my boss used to say. \n\n* The start-up costs for a 'hacker' are relatively small: Some books, a computer, an internet connection, a lot of free time and a metric-buttload of patience. The costs for building and maintaining an enterprise scale application, as well as maintaining a dedicated trained penetration testing team, following the highest security standards, etc etc are relatively exorbitant. \n\n\n**tl;dr:**\n\n**Firstly, software systems are so complex that security vulnerabilities are almost inevitable in the code you write...let alone the myriad of other systems you depend on to make your system functional and available.**\n\n**Secondly, Security experts need to win every single day to prevent a breech and keep their averagely paid white collar job, hackers only need to win once to earn themselves everything from infamy to millions of dollars to furthering some political end** ",

What happens when 3 people all try to fit through the same doorway? They'll all get stuck or only one out of those three will get through. So it gets congested. This is a DDoS attack.\n\nA hacker is a person that knows software and code well enough to understand the framework that the company is using and may be aware of security loopholes they can use while a DDoS attack is imminent. Since there's so much traffic going on, it can be extremely difficult to trace the security breach back to who actually did it. Which is why it can take awhile before the person is caught. GOOD GOOD hackers not only know the software/code well enough to get in, but they know it well enough to delete any trace of them that has been there in the logs.

And the simple, hard fact is that there is *always* a finite load any server/server farm/IP can take, and if a network already is at near capacity (say, during peak hours when the most users are on) it's not that hard (relatively speaking) to command a good size fleet of botnets to spam connections at that point and create an overload.\n\nIf the bot nets didn't exist, hackers would have to rely more on tricks like certain reflection/amplification attacks, one of which can cause an unpatched server to respond to certain packets with 500 times as much data, but aimed at a different IP address than the one the packet came from.

[PSN hack is a prime example of incompetence](_URL_0_)\n\n > are the hackers just really good at what they do?\n\nHackers are, but most people who call themselves \"hackers\" are just script kiddies, I'll elaborate later.\n\nYou see, there are several techniques you can use to break in; on a very vulnerable system you will just need to know how to google, but on more secure systems you probably be needing to employ a mix of all techniques. In the end, hacking boils down to finding the weakest link. If you are a resourceful and determined individual, you WILL find a weak link and you will be able to exploit it.\n\n**Information: surveying the target**\n\nFirst thing an hacker needs is to know what he is attacking. Are there good protection systems? Which? Are the employees trained and aware about cyber security issues? Which software are they using? Is it up to date? etc etc etc\n\nThere are many ways to answer these questions, some you answer just by running programs you can download from the internet, others you will need to find out by yourself, others you can just ask, and others you may never see answered. Whatever the case, the more information about the system, the easier it is for the hacker to know what to do.\n\n\"Obfuscation is the best type of security\"  < - remember this!\n\n**DDoS - Distributed denial of service**\n\nEvery machine is limited in someway. If all computers in the world started to send crap at google, google servers WOULD go down. That is denial of service, sending so much crap to some machine that the target just disconnects because it can't handle all that traffic you sent. It is distributed because you need a lot of machines to make the attack; a single computer isn't enough.\n\nThis is very basic, very effective and it costs a lot of money and headaches to your target. Besides, you can literally hire someone with the access to the computing power needed for a Denial of Service attack for as little as $500 a day if you know where to look. Or better, you can download a simple app from the net, type the address you want to attack, hit the \"fire high orbit ion cannon\" and then call your friends to do the same. Your local news network website will probably go down like a fly. And you will go to jail.\n\nIt's not impossible to defend against a ddos, but it's very expensive because you need to pay for someone who owns the gear to defend you or you need the specialized gear (you need a $50.000+ hardware firewall, which is like a firewall but instead of an app it's literally a machine built entirely just for firewalling).\n\nBottom line is, it's very easy to do a ddos and very hard to defend against one. But on the bright side, the only thing bad that happens is the system becoming unavailable: no passwords stolen, no emails leaked, no credit card info released. The bright side about DDoS is that it's all about making your target suffer, nothing else.... \"bright side\"....\n\n**Known vulnerabilities** (PSN hack was all done like this)\n\n* an hacker wants to break into your computer. He is not sure if your pc is up to date but he is pretty sure it isn't. \n* The hacker goes to the Microsoft web site and checks which vulnerabilities that could give him access to your computer have been recently fixed.\n* He googles how to \"exploit\" that vulnerability. Some times there are already scripts (short programs that do only one thing) written to exploit that vulnerability. \n* He writes a script or uses the one he found on google to compromise the system.\n* Thus the name \"script kiddies\", you don't have to actually do the hard work of finding the vulnerability, most times you just need to run a script et voilá, you're in.\n\nThis is valid to any software. Linux, Microsoft, Apache, Oracle, etc, every vendor announces which vulnerabilities where fixed. And even when they don't you can just google for it.\n\n**Find your own vulnerabilities**\n\n If the system is fully up to date, you can try to find a vulnerability, but that is really really hard. First you must know a lot, and I mean, a lot about programming, operating systems, digital networks, databases and systems administration. Those are 5 completely distinct areas in which each of them can take a lifetime to master. Most of us know our way around all 5 but focus our attentions in one of those (eg I'm a programmer and my friend is a sysadmin).\n\nNow what I'm telling you is that you must be really good at all those 5 areas, which is something so hard to achieve I can't even put it to words. Then you must be very creative and resourceful because there are no instruction manual or rules or anything. It's you, your tools and a blackbox that you must somehow make work the way you want it to without opening it or even knowing what's inside. Every box is different and every hacker is different, but the bottom line is, this is pretty much basically guess work. \"Maybe if I try this, maybe they didn't do that\". And you will try and try and try and you will probably find nothing, because many did what you are doing before you and most vulnerabilities where already found.\n\n**Social Engineering**\n\nIt's as simple as discovering how some general's password was his dogs name at the pentagon. It's as simple as calling that 60 year old secretary and convincing her that you are from the IT department and you need her password. There are countless books about social engineering and truth be said, you can virtually compromise any system just by the power of social engineering alone. It's by far the simplest and the most effective \"hacking\" technique. \n\n\n**Discovering passwords: brute forces, dictionary attacks and db dumps**\n\nWhen you need to discover a password, you can just try every possible combination, that's called brute forcing, but it takes a long time and good passwords are virtually impossible to brute force. The alternative is dictionaries, which are just pre-built lists of the most used combinations of passwords.\n\nBest alternative are db dumps. Some hackers, when they compromise a server like the playstation server, they get all the passwords they stole and just post everything on the internet for everyone to see. \n\n**Escalation**\n\nEscalation just means you are getting higher privileges. Imagine you managed to enter the server hosting Microsoft web page. Congratulations, you did something really hard, but without any practical applications. Now you need to escalate, you need to jump from that web server to the e-mail server if you want to steal those e-mails or to the database server if you want those shinny passwords. The more secure a system is, the harder it is to escalate.\n\n**So... how can I protect myself?**\n\nBe smart, be informed. Keep all your software updated, use hard and different passwords for your more important accounts (not using your mail password on that browser game you love is a big start), enable two way authentication, don't install java if you can avoid it, don't use adobe reader, don't open shit you don't trust is legit, don't open any e-mails about penis enlargement, don't click on stupid shit on facebook, don't open torrent or download sites you don't trust, don't use pendrives(you don't need them in 2014). Extra points if you use Linux/iOS.\n\n\n**Is it even possible to be \"invulnerable\"? Is my company safe?**\n\nAlmost. Besides everything else I already said, the most important thing is you must isolate your modules. The better you isolate your machines and apps, the harder will it be for the hacker to escalate. The hacker must not be able to jump from one server to another freely. This is something (almost) as simple as having different passwords and different users with different privileges for each app but that most sysadmins seem to not do.\n\nThen there is obfuscation: don't use common things everyone users, don't use the name administrator for the administrator account, don't use the usual ip ranges (10.0.0.x and 192.168.0.x), don't show your users which applications you are running, etc. In short, don't do what everyone else does, and specially, don't show everyone how you are doing your security, be smart and hide your shit: \"Obfuscation is the best security\".\n\nBut the most important is protecting yourself from your own employees. Your employees will screw up by installing or downloading crap or may be fooled by an hacker, you mustn't allow this.\nConsultancy companies and pharmaceutical companies where the companies I noticed that had the best security systems, however, those systems end up being intrusive: Users cannot install any personal software on their company laptops, users can't open private e-mail there, to open the email you must be connected to the companies VPN and insert a special code that your keychain generates, your password changes every 30 days, etc. It's annoying, but it works. . \n\n\nYeah, we all know all these measures are very intrusive and a real pain in the ass, but they are absolutely necessary! So don't get mad at your IT guy and don't call him a fracking nazi behind his back. We do this because YOU are not informed and YOU will make mistakes that may compromise the whole company and consequently both your salary and my salary. We are not assuming you are stupid, we know you aren't, but it's our job to assume everything is a possible weak link and we don't want to leave any stone unturned. Sorry =(\n\n**Are you an hacker? Cause you sure sound like one...**\n\nNo, I've been a sysadmin and I'm now a programmer. Knowing what is out there and how to be protected is a tool of the trade.\n\nedit: added stuff on obfuscation and ddos, corrected typos",
                "Hacking is what happened at Sony Pictures last week.  Someone broke into their system, and stole a bunch of files/information, and is using them for financial/political/personal/who knows gain.  Doing that takes some combination of social engineering, well-written malicious code, disgruntled employees, unsecure networks, etc.  The hackers gain material benefit from what they are able to steal/manipulate.  \n\nWhen PSN/XBL go down it is usually something else called a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.  Instead of maliciously accessing PSN/XBL and turning it \"off,\" people can shut down these networks through sheer noise.  These \"hackers\" gain by denying others usage of a common resource.  A common gain from this type of attack is to extort payment to stop this attack.  \n\nA malicious user(or users) who have access to other computers (through viruses, malware, etc), gets those computers to all start talking to PSN/XBL.  Those machines aren't going to actually do anything with the network, but the sheer noise of all of them figuratively saying \"hello PSN!\" makes the PSN unable to handle them and the legitimate requests.  \n\nThink of a line to check out at a grocery store.  A hacking approach would be to hack in, change the prices of everything in your cart to $0.01, and then checking out with $200 of groceries for spare change.

This is called an \"amplification\" attack.\n\nWhen an amplification attack occurs, the \"bots\" send a tiny request to a public server using a forged return address. The type of request is usually the type that returns the largest response. With an NTP server, that type of request is called a \"Monlist\" request. It asks for the most recent servers who previously talked to that NTP server. Due to the command being poorly thought-out, it was designed to return a list of up to 600 servers! This is a large chunk of information that is then returned (thanks to the bogus return address) to, let's say Microsoft's servers. Although Microsoft's routers know that this data wasn't requested and discard it immediately, all of these responses (thousands upon thousands per second) take up Microsoft's bandwidth, which squeezes out lots of legitimate traffic. \n\nMicrosoft and Sony have a long road ahead of them. They already spend millions paying for bandwidth and load balancing to handle legitimate traffic but now will be forced to spend far more money to mitigate attacks. Simply buying more bandwidth isn't a viable solution, as these \"Lizard Squad\" fuckwits will simply amplify their attacks more to match the increased bandwidth. The only true solutions are to patch vulnerabilities (such as the seemingly-useless \"monlist\" command for NTP servers) and try to design Xbox Live/PSN so that gamers can still game despite network outages. \n\nDDoS will never go away. Even if Lizard Squad all get arrested there will be a copycat group that will pick up where they left off. The only good that can come out of this is heightening everyone's awareness of network vulnerabilities, which leads to bigger security budgets and improved attack mitigation in the future. Sony and Microsoft are getting caught with their pants down and need to spend some of their billions they've earned in mitigating this type of damage.

Let's say you bake and sell cakes.\n\nOf course your business is limited to how many people you can serve at one given time. Limiting factors are how much space you have, how big the door is, how many bakers you have, and how many cashiers you have. Let's say you can support 20 people looking at cakes and placing orders.\n\nLet's say I want to hurt your business for the lulz. I walk in and start fucking around, you can ignore me because 19 other customers can come in and place legit orders. I can't do it alone. This is the magic of a DDoS attack. DDoS stands for **Distributed Denial of Service**.\n\nDenial of Service (**DoS**) is exactly that. I somehow cause an interruption of service to legitimate customers. A DISTRIBUTED DoS attack spreads the load of hurting your business out among others so that I don't have to do it alone.\n\nAll I have to do is get more than 20 people to clog up the front of your store. I call up 30 of my friends and have them call up 30 of their friends so on and so forth, we gather up hundreds of people to come by your store at the same time to all get a sample, see how lifelike you can make cakes shaped like giant penises, and order a cake for Chuck U. Farley's Birthday extravaganza...\n\nThing is, with computers, you don't even need to know 30 people who know 30 more and so forth... Newer malware can turn every infected computer into a bot (drone, zombie, etc.) that will do things by remote control. Once you have a bunch of infected computers throughout the world they turn into a network of robots; AKA a BotNet.\n\nGetting back to my dumbed down cake shop example, so how do you stop me from coming in with my buddies and their friends and their friends of friends?\n\nWell, you can only deal with high end hotels and catering companies stop dealing with the general public... That stops random jackasses from coming in. This is difficult to do with PlayStation Network and Xbox live because everyone needs to have access to these services.\n\nYou can open two or three locations. That way, if I clog up Bakery A, you can shift legitimate customers to Bakery B and C.\nThing is, you've still gotta be able to tell your legitimate customers from Bakery A to go to Bakery B and Bakery C. Now all my buddies know and they'll start clogging up Bakery B and Bakery C. Likewise, Microsoft and Sony have multiple datacenters for their services. They're all publicly facing and I could check my own PlayStation or Xbox to see where it's trying to connect to.\n\nYou could put a security guard at the door. Unfortunately that slows service down.\n\nIn the end, you basically have to make your establishment bigger than I can clog up.

Many believe that a well known name will get the job done and it sounds good to the CEO so they go home at night and assume they are safe. \n\nThe truth is that there is no such thing as security. If someone really wants to penetrate a network, they will. I'm in the business of risk management. The Sony hack was by no means easy, it must've taken months if not years to obtain all the infrastructure information the hackers were privy to. They had malware built specifically for certain servers and knew them by name. What does that mean? Either they had a man on the inside or spent a really really long time doing recon and obtaining admin credentials. \n\nA lot of the attacks you hear about on the news are not very sophisticated at all. They use tried and true simple tactics that still manage to bypass the majority of security infrastructure out there. DDoS are what babies do when they yell over people, it's not even a real hack. \n\nThere is a reason that you hear about 14 year olds with too much time on their hands taking down sites. It's easy as hell. You download the right program to get the job done. Back in the day hackers would write their own code and build their entire attack themselves. That means they would do the fishing, code the vulnerability scanner, code the payload file, find the information they need and then a channel through which to exfiltrate it. THAT was hard. Now you can pay someone to DDoS a site for you for 5 dollars an hour...\n\nIf you don't believe me and think this is a little farfetched, next time you are at work see if you can upload any sort of company sensitive information to a cloud site or send it to yourself over web mail. Chances are your employer doesn't even have visibility into that encrypted channel (https). Turns out they do? Screenshot the sensitive info or save as a pdf then send it out. Guess what? Unless your employer is using Websense DLP they can't even look into image files and scan them for sensitive data. \n\nToo many people are comfortable with compliance (check box) security that doesn't protect their sensitive information very much if at all.

                "Souce: I've worked as a network engineer for a company that ran the multiplayer network for various AAA games.\n\nMy personal feeling is that the good hackers don't waste time with a DDOS because it doesn't give the source any data, it just makes something unavailable.\n\nFirst I'll outline the 3 normal types of attacks networks like PSN and XBL would see,\n\nSending traffic blindly (via CHARGEN or NTP reflection type attacks) - These are easily ignored by blocking the affected ports and as long as your ISP has the backbone capacity (which you don't have to pay for) you'll generally be fine.\n\nTargeted ports (ie sending TCP/80 to a webserver) - This requires a little more effort because you still have to allow that port in, but you can have this traffic blocked by a firewall or something else that scrubs the traffic before it gets to the webserver.\n\nFlooding valid traffic (such as a SYN flood) - There isn't much that can be done upstream for this on the cheap because it's essentially a valid HTTP request, just a lot of them which uses up all the free ports. This can be mitigated via devices in front of the webserver such as a loadbalancer which can eat up the request without killing the backend servers so it comes down to bandwidth and luckily these type of attacks are high packets-per-second but low bandwidth.\n\nThere are more but I think that covers most.\n\nA majority of DDOS we saw were essentially people who purchased some time on a botnet where \"the tard\" gave them an IP address (and often a port) then gave them $x per hour (or some variant) and the botnet would go off and DDOS for how ever long the customer has paid for. I certainly wouldn't call these people hackers and generally they can be ignored if you have a decent amount of bandwidth or some basic ACL's (_URL_0_) because these people think they can spend $30 and take down PSN or XBL. Companies see them but with the decent security you'll notice nothing.\n\nIn a normal AAA title launch month we'd see well over 100 separate attacks and usually well less than 5% would actually do anything of notice. These type of services are usually used for DDOSing a specific person (ie someone on twitch) or a small-medium sided company's website.\n\nThe small number of attacks that people actually notice are either people who purchase time on multiple botnets or potentially run their own one with specific attack style (like NTP reflection before everyone started blocking it) but your question is WHY these affect large networks, the catch here is that they typically go for the more complex DDOS attacks which can't be mitigated cheaply and to often someone who gets paid a lot of money decided the risk was worth it in comparison to the cost of a solution that would mitigate that risk.\n\nThat's not to say there isn't something you can't do and that's where the paid services come in, like some of the stuff Akamai do. They announce your IP as if it were from them and that way their data scrubbing sites all across the world will clean this DDOS traffic as close to the DDOS source as they can which means the bandwidth never becomes an issue and it's all monitored and runs on black magic so generally people just don't notice anything, catch is this stuff costs ... a lot. However it's still cheaper than buying 300gig of internet bandwidth and all the network gear that's needed to run that. Companies the scale of Google/Microsoft etc with points-of-presence all over the world have their own black magic solutions.\n\nTL;DR management get cheap and don't follow their engineers suggestions.",

                "There is no real market for good security. Everybody wants something cheap and security gets out of picture.\n\nSecurity is hard to get right with systems that are so complex that we barely get them to work in normal conditions. Security is about active adversary. Security bugs are different nature than regular functionality bugs. If product has two regular bugs that 2% of customers run into, ok, no big deal. If product has two security bugs, bad people will use them (and possibly share them with other bad people) maliciously so 100% of customers will be affected.\n\nWhen you need to buy a home wifi router, which one you buy? The one for $30 or one for $500 with same features and better security. Probably the cheaper one because the security hard to evaluate. Both will claim they have security features and both with disclaim any responsibility and liability in license. You don't know if you are buying good security until it is too late. And market forces will allow company with the $30 router to prevail.\nIt is same with most hardware and software.\n\nStrong security is also often not practical, there is a compromise between security and usability. Company managers often choose practical solution over secure one. It is practical to have single network with no compartments in whole company, but more secure is to have some separation so that successful attack in small company unit does not extend into whole company. Security guys in any company know this, but that is not enough, they have to persuade business people to accept less productivity for more security. That rarely happens and even if it does, will such less productive company survive on market?\n\nPeople are often weak links too. No amount of education will make them perfect. Secure behavior is hard to learn and evolving. What is sufficiently secure behavior today might not be next week. I remember times when not running exe and com files from diskette and not booting from it was sufficient to prevent infections. Reading documents from it was safe. But then came viruses in MS Word files. Then came viruses in autorun.inf so that just inserting a flash disk was sufficient for infection unless you disabled autorun in registry (until MS reacted to that threat few Windows versions later). At one time it was considered that browsing pages on internet is safe as long as you don't download executable files and run them. But then security bugs constantly discovered in browsers and plugins mean you have to have up to date software to safely browse internet. At one time Apple computers were considered to be safe from viruses. They just did not happen to be valuable targets by then, but they are now. At one time browser addons/extensions/plugins were there to help you, now there are a lot of malicious ones that will steal your bank credentials. At one time if email arrived from bank or phisher you could tell right link from wrong by visually checking URL bar, but then homograph attacks and domains with international characters appeared. At one time viruses were written for fame and feel of control by lone wolfs, now they are written for extortion, corporate espionage and money stealing by very organized thieve groups having hundreds of workers. Malware and regular software distinction is becoming fuzzy. Thieves are buying sources and means of distribution of programs and mobile apps from original authors and including malware functionality along with regular functionality. Innocent software may become malicious just by updating to a new version because new owners of it are malicious. Some software is being written from scratch with intent of providing something useful and including something malicious along.\n\n\ntl;dr security is hard and evolving, it is also not cheap and hard to evaluate so cheaper but less secure SW wins in marketplace\n\n\nAbove is about general computer security, regarding the DDOS attacks that happened, they cannot be well prevented if attackers control large number of computers on internet (to which they gained access by exploiting weak security). They just do requests like regular users from all controlled computers but they have many and do so many requests that service cannot handle them.

                "Cory Doctorow has a brilliant way that he explains it, which I'm going to try and paraphrase:\n\nWhen it comes to computers, \"security\" (or resistance to being hacked) is a very special type of feature. See, anyone can design a security system so robust and resistant that they themselves can't break into it, but getting one that everyone else can't get into is a much harder task. Historically, the solution to this problem has been to open up your security system to inspection, and to allow people to deliberately try to break through it - kind of like how big banks will occasionally hire professionals to try and break into their vaults to see how effective they are.\n\nThe problem is, under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act,  it's illegal to try and crack open a computer with a security system on it, even if that security system is severely flawex, weak, and/or notably easy to bypass. AND, even more important than that, if you DO manage to crack a system open, it's illegal for you to \"distribute\" your method of doing so, or in other words it's illegal to tell anyone how you did it.\n\nAs a result of this, it's very difficult to develop good computer security at all, because sharing with each other what works and what doesn't could get you arrested for doing so.\n\nSo, to answer your question: it's not that hackers are just unstoppable, invincible computer gods - it's that the majority of computers are walking around with big \"press X to hack me!\" signs hanging off them wherever they go, and it's illegal to fix them."

                "Let me more or less reprint an [older answer of mine](_URL_0_):\n\nIn Early Republican Turkey, Ataturk tried to \"modernize\" the country: he got rid of the caliph, introduce Western civil and criminal law, changed from Arabic-Persian letters to adapted Latin ones, started universal public education, organized the first modern census, and, relevant for this discussion, modernized dress.  One of the big ways he modernized dress was outlawing the fez and introducing European style hats (from the top hat to the fedora to the Irish immigrant cap); this was covered in the Hat Law of 1925.  Despite the fact that the fez was only introduced to most of the Ottoman empire in 1826-9 following the surpression of the Janissaries (to replace the turban) as one of the earlier concentrated modernization attempts, conservatives clung to it desperately and **in 1925, dozens of people were executed because they wore fezes* (yes, fez the hat).  The symbol of 19th century modernism and bureaucracy had become a symbol of early 20th century anti-modernism and reactionaries. See \"Kemalism on the Catwalk: The Turkish Hat Law of 1925\" by Camilla T. Nereid.  \n\n > Considered an important tool by Mustafa Kemal in his attempts to modernize Turkish society, a new dress code was enacted in 1925 that required traditional headgear be replaced by the western hat. In subsequent days, 808 people were arrested for violating the law, 57 of whom were executed.\n\nTl;dr Ataturk and co. were  deadly serious about modernizing, by which they often meant \"becoming European\".\n\nAs an interesting side note, in much of the Arab parts of the former Ottoman Empire, the fez hung on as a symbol of modernism for a few more decades. I've read articles on a western suit plus fez as the dress code of the Iraqi middle class into the 1950's at least. ",
                "After the excesses of cruelty in the Caribbean the Spanish Crown repeatedly tried to curtail massacres and violence enacted by it's agents abroad. To this end legal *entradas* required official Crown license before entering/conquering new lands, excessive violence toward and enslavement of Native Americans was outlawed, and would-be *conquistadores* were required to first read the [*Requerimiento*](_URL_2_) where peace was promised to those who willingly submitted to Spanish dominion (we'll ignore the ridiculousness of the *Requerimiento* for now). However, as conquest unfolded a loophole developed where conquerors could perform horrible acts of display violence, enslave whole villages, and execute women if those individuals were determined to be rebels. This loophole is also responsible for one of the more pervasive myths surrounding conquest, that of a completed conquest.\n\nI talked about the myth of a completed conquest [here](_URL_1_), and will adapt sections of that post here. For those interested check out chapter four of [*Seven Myths of the Spanish Conquest*](_URL_0_) by Matthew Restall for the best, brief analysis of this myth.\n\nBriefly, the process of claiming title over lands required local authorities to present a completed invasion with a pacified indigenous population. Personal claims complemented the larger Spanish imperial justification of conquest as guided by divine providence, and required by papal decree. Together, these attempts to validate personal, as well as imperial expansion, established conquest as complete, interpreted resistance as rebellion, and imbued an unfinished conquest with an air of inevitable success.\n\nAs background, during the exploration and conquest of the New World the Spanish crown sold licenses to explore/conquer/rule a specific region. *Adelantados* bore the cost of mounting the hazardous expeditions into the unknown, and successful invaders would gain from the production of their land, after the crown took it’s *quinto* (a fifth of spoils and taxes). The crown benefited substantially from selling these grants. Instead of devoting prohibitively expensive military resources to control land in the New World, these contracts placed the financial burden for territorial expansion on would-be *conquistadores*. The crown gained potential income from new lands, and contractually held the ability to regulate extremes of conquistador behavior if they failed to comply with the terms of the contract. Punishments for abuses or failure to act in a timely manner ranged from imprisonment, to substantial fines, or revoking the original license.\n\n*Adelantados* were therefore placed under extreme pressure to maintain the resources required for a successful *entrada*, establish a permanent base of operations, find something that made the new colony immediately economically viable to recoup their losses and continue to hold crown support (hence the preoccupation with precious metals), and convince the crown the local population posed no threat to their endeavors. Lobbying between *adelantados* and the crown often took years. For example, Juan de Oñate originally submitted a license to conquer New Mexico in 1595, petitioned repeatedly to lobby for contractual fulfillment when the license was revoked in 1597, and then engaged in a prolonged legal battle from 1606-1624 for use of excessive force during the *entrada*.\n\nPresenting their lands both worthy of conquest and easily conquered emerged as common theme for *adelantados* attempting to validate their position and maintain continued royal support. The formulaic writing style stressed not only a completely conquered native population, but one willing to submit both to Spanish rule and the Catholic faith, regardless of the actual facts on the ground. Hedged in religious terminology, and with papal support that acted as a divine grant of land for Castile and Portugal, “claims of possession became synonymous with possession itself” (Restall, p.68).\n\nQueen Isabel stated, in 1501, that the vast number of inhabitants populating the New World were “subjects and vassals” and should “pay to us our tributes and rights”. Yep. Nine years after Columbus landed, and before anyone had any idea the vastness of the Americas, all inhabitants in lands claimed by Spain were subjects of the crown, they just didn’t know it yet. Couched in these terms, Native American resistance to conquest became an unholy rebellion, and violent resistance an illegal infringement on colonial peace. Since *conquistadores* were fighting rebels against the crown and the Catholic faith, military campaigns were undertaken for pacification (not conquest). Since resistance leaders were rebels they could be tried and executed for treason, their followers legally enslaved for rebellion (despite the official ban on native slavery within the empire). I’ll quote Restall here because I can’t put it better…\n\n >  This pattern can be seen in the Yucatan as well as in virtually every region of Spanish America. Having founded a new colonial capital in 1542, named Mérida, the Spaniards in Yucatan declared the Conquest achieved and set about “pacifying” the peninsula. But as they controlled only a small corner of it, they were obliged to engage in major military hostilities with one Maya group after another, encountering particularly strong resistance in the northeast in the late 1540s. This was clearly an episode in a conquest war now in its third decade, but just as the Spaniards had already declared the Conquest complete so did they now classify this resistance as a rebellion… This was used to justify the execution of captives, the use of display violence (notably the hanging of women), and the enslaving of 2,000 Mayas of the region. Four centuries later, historians were still calling this “The Great Maya Revolt.” (p. 69)\n\nAn uncritical examination of the primary documents of conquest obscures the complexity of ongoing non-violent resistance, as well as open warfare and revolt, throughout the Empire. *Adelantados*, local officials, and the greater empire hoped and prayed their endeavors would succeed. Until they established complete control over lands granted to them by the Crown the rules of the empire rewarded those who maintained the fiction of an uncomplicated, completed conquest. If we inherit an inevitable narrative of conquest it is only because, in hindsight, we read the hopes of *adelantados* as truth despite constant acts of \"rebellion\" percolating throughout an Empire attempting to complete a very unfinished conquest. The myth of a completed conquest protected *adelantados* from a revoked license, while simultaneously allowing them the legal use of increased force to subdue rebellion, and the freedom within the law to enslave troublesome subjects.

                "Terrorism *in the West* has certainly become more common in the past few years. In general it is quite rare in the Western world, so the terrorist attacks we've seen in 2015 and 2016 make for a large relative increase.\n\nHowever, these kinds of events have been ordinary occurrences in places like Iraq or Afghanistan for well over a decade, and to a lesser degree in many other countries. They rarely get more than a short mention on the evening news; there is so much focus on terrorism in the U.S. and Europe lately precisely because the current rate is so unusual.",
                "I guess you're talking from a US perspective - I've not done the maths but I'd think in the UK we're probably had a lot less terrorist since the 90s when IRA bombings were at their height.  ",
                "it's called historical myopia\n\npeople view the past through a nostalgic, false reimagination of the past\n\nin reality, every generation sees things getting worse, even as progress makes things better. Examples with quotes \n\nWhen I was young, we were taught to be discreet and respectful of elders, but the present youth are exceedingly disrespectful and impatient of restraint.\n\nHesiod, 8th century BC\n\nWhat is happening to our young people? They disrespect their elders, they disobey their parents. They ignore the law. They riot in the streets inflamed with wild notions. Their morals are decaying. What is to become of them?\n\nPlato, 4th Century BC\n\nThe young people of today think of nothing but themselves. They have no reverence for parents or old age. They are impatient of all restraint... As for the girls, they are forward, immodest and unladylike in speech, behavior and dress.\nAttributed to Peter the Hermit, AD 12743\nsame shit, different century",
                "Also, we have much more access to events basically immediately when they happen. Where as in the past it would take a long time for news to travel of such events. Not only that but the media gets ratings off of fear. If people are scared, they tend to tune in to the tv more. Yes terror attacks are happening. But they have been happening for as long as time has been recorded. ",
                "This is a hard one to measure as it really depends on where you are.\n\nIn places like the UK and Sri Lanka, terrorism as such has most dropped in the last 20 years, but for countries like France, Belgium and Turkey, this is far higher. \n\nI do agree with the point you're making though. Better accessibility of new means this information is available quicker and in greater amounts, which intensifies the \"breaking news\" factor and may create the illusion that it is more frequent. ",
                "History would say we are currently in the safest era of living.\n\n24/7 media would have you believe otherwise.\n\nAdd into the fact that coverage is higher when it happens in 1st world countries too, and it may seem like the world is ending at times.\n\nIt isn't. \n\n",
                "I would also like to add that the recent string of (rather high profile) terrorist attacks which is carried out by a single organization  Isis (or its sympathizers) means that they get near constant press coverage. \n\nIf this were done by separate groups it may have felt less omnipresent.",
                "Hard to say, but we tend to look at history through rose colored glasses. People forget that the 1970s had an INSANE number of terrorist hijackings.  \n_URL_0_\nCould you imagine what the news would be like if those things were happening today?\n\nI think social media and 24 hour news just makes any global event more known these days.",
                "_URL_0_\n\nIt's crazy that school shootings in the U.S. go all the way back to 1764. \n\nIn that list, the number of school shootings has definitely increased over the last few decades, however, it doesn't list the increase in number of schools themselves and the increase in population. So, it's hard to immediately assess if the number of school shootings has remained proportional to the number of schools/population or whether it's actually gone up. Someone else can do that math. I don't feel like it.",
                "Yes, terrorism is on the rise due to the regional proxy war(s) in the Middle East between Iran and Saudi Arabia, the development of homogenous immigrant neighborhoods in Europe that breed Islamist activity, and the rising ethno-social polarization in the west.",
                "I can't find the quote but US secretary of war in WW2 Henry Stimson said he had to sacrifice 10's of thousands of troops in the Phillipines and that was the kind of decision that would need to be made for the rest of the war. We don't have to deal with shit like that.",
                "Global terrorism is down in 2015 but increased in the west.\n\n_URL_0_\n\nThat's year on year though, so it depends on when your baseline is? Since the year 2014? Down. Since the year 2000? Up massively. \n\nCurrently the Islamic State is being pushed back, losing ground both in Iraq and Syria. This is causing them to become more desperate and they are beginning to strike out more. They also have a very effective propaganda arm that is radicalising some Europeans. If you check the link you can see the most deadly attacks mostly took place in the Middle East, with some in Africa. We actually don't hear that much about those attacks here in the west. ",
                "I personally think not only does it make us more aware of it, the media also increases it's effectiveness by allowing more mass hysteria and increasing it's effects to a global scale.",
                "The other issue with perception of terrorism is that for many years, terrorist groups were obsessed with attacking major landmarks with symbolic value. US military bases, embassies, airliners, sporting events, etc. Even the 9/11 hijackers went well out of their way to hit big, visible symbols of American power.   \n\nNowadays, you've got a bunch of guys who just attack the closest group of massed civilians, so it feels more threatening. \n",
                "Not to stray off topic - but I was reading a thread here the other night where people were reminiscing about being able to be outside all day as kids - and how nowadays that just doesn't happen. Apparently there was a study done saying it's not any worse today than it was twenty-thirty years ago, we just now have visibility to all the terrible things that have happened. ",
                "This is a question redditors are probably not qualified to answer. Unless among us is a credibly expert?  \n\nI can only give my impression/thoughts, and they are this: Terrorism as we define it today is a relatively new phenomenon that is born out of and exacerbated by the media because it's purpose is to bring a message of violence and fear to a wide audience, which the media does exceptionally well.  \n\nTerrorism has probably been around forever, a notable historical example being Vlad the Impaler impaling people in order to terrorize his opponents.\n\nThese do feel markedly different, though. They feel like organized state actions, meant to warn other states against conflict. Vlad's goal was to demoralize leaders and troops who might engage in war with them.\n\nModern terrorism is not about \"scaring off\" conflict, it's about promising conflict, and it's not directed at states it's directed at innocent citizens. It's goal is to change a state from the inside by terrorizing it civilian population with violence that appears to have no clear objective or end point as would normally be expected from a war.\n\nIf we view modern terrorism as being a new thing, with different goals than old war morale tactics, then yes, it is new it is on the rise and the media **does** make us more aware of it which is vital to it's success.",
                "A point that I don't think has been covered yet:\nTerrorism requires media involvement to be the most effective. The model that the IRA used (early on anyway) was to set a bomb and alert the media with no real intention of setting it off, more a \"look what we can do, pay attention to our demands\" goal.\n\nMore media coverage means that the goals of terrorism (to spread fear and draw attention to a group for the purposes of making demands/gaining power) are more efficient to achieve. It's a symbiotic relationship.",
                "Depending on what you mean by \"Terrorism\" we live in a relatively peaceful time. From the 1880s up until around the 1960s many black churches were firebombed. The genocide committed by Polpot may or may not be considered as terrorist acts. The Bosnian War which most will certainly agree used terrorist style tactics. The ongoing wars in African countries such as Sudan and Somalia where terrorist style attacks are carried out regularly. Note that most of these aren't western nations. And while crises like the Bosnian War were covered, western media tends to ignore the plight of non western nations. If you take a rough definition of terrorism as using means against a populace to induce fear and terror, then the world is relatively more peaceful today than in the past.",
                "Although the \"historical myopia\" effect is real, and we are in fact living in the most peaceful era in history, I would still say that terrorism is really on the rise.       \nI don't know about terrorism in third-world or other Muslim countries, but terrorism in the western world is on a huge rise in past couple of years- just look at the recent terror attacks in France, the US, Belgium and more. (Turkey and Israel too, although it's more debatable)\nI can't remember when so many terror attacks happened in such a short time since WW2.",
                "Terrorism is up about 800%, global conflict deaths up 350% since 2008. There are currently more refugees in the world than at any point in human history, even more than during the Cold War. (_URL_0_) \n\nI see a lot of displaced optimism on here about this, that we Iive in the \"most peaceful era in history\". It's just not true anymore, the 1990s and 2000s were dramatically more stable and peaceful. We aren't living in an EXTREMELY dangerous era, it's not anything compared to WW2, but things are definitely bad right now. \n",
                "I've recently been reading about the anarchist's bombing campaigns in America during the 1920s. It's something I didn't really know about, but it was pretty common at the time for major figures to be sent bombs in the post, or for bombs to be left in busy areas, and there were a lot of casualties. Here's Bill Bryson writing about one of the bigger incidents in *One Summer: America 1927*:\n\n > A horse drawn wagon pulled up outside the offices of JP Morgan  &  Co. at the corner of Broad and Wall Streets in Manhattan. The driver, it is supposed, tethered the horse and and departed sharply, for a few moments later the cart exploded with a force that rocked the district and blew out windows on the 32nd floor of a building more than a block away. The bomb was a particularly viscous one: packed with shrapnel, it was designed to maim and was detonated when the street was packed with lunchtime office workers. Thirty people were killed instantly and several hundred people injured. The heat of the blast was so intense that many of the victims suffered severe burns on top of any other injuries. A clerk at JP Morgan was decapitated by a sheet of flying glass, but no senior members of the firm - the supposed principal targets - were among the victims. [...] At the end of the day, the casualty totals were 38 dead and 143 gravely injured. ",
                "Not necessarily about terrorism, but still relevant. \n\nPeople only seem to focus on the problems we have today, and we rarely look at the past and see how far we've come. \n\nLots of people are talking about how America is going down the drain.  Race relations, police issues, the 2016 election, mass shootings, gun control, etc.\n\nBut if we look back 50 years or so, America is doing better now than it ever was. \n\nWithin the past ~50-60 years we went through the civil rights movement.  Black Americans still lived under segregation, and protestors were not treated kindly. \n\nThousands of American men were drafted and sent to die against their will in Vietnam, some country no one had heard of, all in the name of a vague philosophy. \n\nPeaceful protesters at Kent state were shot by the national guard. \n\nThe Cuban missile crisis, probably the closest we've ever gotten to ending the world. \n\nPresident JFK was assassinated. \n\nPresident Nixon resigned after the Watergate scandal. \n\nNot to mention that violent crime was steadily rising this entire time, peaking in the 80s. \n\nAmerican politics have always been fucked.  Our problems aren't anything new.  But at the same time, violent crime has been falling for decades, life expectancy is up, and the worst scandal many working age people remember is Bill Clinton getting a BJ. \n\nMedia would have you believe that the world is coming to an end, but we're living in a time of unparalleled peace.  Many people's parents or grandparents grew up with a threat of constant nuclear war from the Russians.\n\nAmerica is a lot less frightening now than it ever was, no matter what the media tells you. ",
                "It is slightly on the rise, but it's still far less than the 70s where you had many home grown terrorists such as ETA, the IRA, RAF etc... Now we have much less attacks, but they're with a different motivation.\n\n_URL_0_\nSource:\n_URL_1_\n\nSome speculate that after the Cold War, there was a shock to international fault lines, and this resulted in a unusual calm.\n\nIf that's right, now intrnational politics and conflicts have settled, a moderate increase makes sense, though whether it goes back to teh 70s, we will see.\n",
                "It's actually increasing a lot, and it's thanks to all the liberal PC folk who insist on defending Islam and BLM.  The mass immigration of Syrians also contributed to the Trojan horse effect.\n\nEdit:  downvote all you want you delusion fools :p",
                "No. All forms of violence are at their lowest point in human history. Accessibility of the news hasn't change much either since the invention of the newspaper and radio. The modern media has an agenda to scare the populace.",
                "TLDR: Since 2000, yes, but the biggest gains are mostly still in Iraq, Nigeria, Afghanistan, Syria, and Pakistan. Historically Europe is used to a certain low level of terrorism. \n\n[The Atlantic](_URL_0_) just ran an article this week; they point to research by Institute for Economics and Peace’s Global Terrorism Index points to some rise in acts of terrorism in Western countries (and certainly last year and this year in France would exacerbate that), but the primary rise in terrorism is confined to countries which have experienced wide scale civil breakdown; Iraq for example is as bad as it was in 2007 when the country was almost in civil war. \n\nIn Europe at least, the recent decades were quite peaceful compared to the 60s-80s, because depending on which country you were in; there were left and right wing terror groups, and independence groups, who regularly took hostages, hijacked airplanes, and bombed nightclubs. Terrorism certainly isn't unfamiliar to Irish adults over a certain age, and older generations (but not so old) in Germany can tell about the Baader Meinhof Gang and extremely violent protests from that era which have no read point of comparison today. Even if you go farther back in history, to the era before WWI, you'll find extreme paranoia about anarchist terrorists, which was a threat that never really materialized in a way that threatened Western civilization, but people at the time did not feel that way, and they worried that mass hysteria would ensue. ",
                "A lot of the uptick we are seeing is largely due to technology and the ability for people to transport into new cultures. It is not uncommon for terrorism to occur in high rates in the Middle East. Historically, this is the norm.\n\nWhat has changed is that people are migrating from these areas/cultures and bringing the behavior with them or they are being removed as refugees to the \"Western\" society and bringing this behavior with them. \n\nBecause we have more people committing terrorist acts in Western societies we hear about it more.",
                "I think we are often conflating two things when we talk about terrorism.\n\n1. Organized attacks on civilians by terrorist organizations for clear political aims. \n\nI would include 9/11, Bali, Madrid, Santa Barbara, Dhaka and the Bataclan as instances of this type. I'd include the Utoya massacre too, because although Brevik acted alone, he is sane and had a clear political goal. Ditto for the Dallas shootings.\n\n\n2. Mass killings where the killer slaps on an ISIS label or other justification. \n\nWhen I look at the details of the Miami shooting, the Oak Creek Massacre, Fort Hood, the Boston Marathon, Charleston, and Nice, I see something else. I see loners going postal, and slapping a post-hoc political justification to their actions. \n\nThey didn't have ties to some larger organization, and in many cases the killer had only tangential involvement in the community that motivated their attack. Dylann Roof had black friends, lots of the Muslims drank/had premarital sex, etc. This type of terrorist may be more common, just as this kind of suicidal mass killer appears to be more common in our disconnected society.\n\nIf James Holmes had shouted \"Allahu Akbar\", would that make him a terrorist? ",
                "If you're in the UK, terrorism hasn't been lower since the 60s. \n\n[During the 70s, 80s and 90s](_URL_0_) terrorism from the IRA across Great Britain including bombs, assassinations and automatic weapon massacres were a regular occurrence when compared with what we see today. \n\nIt's also part of the reason our intelligence services do better than most others in regard to preventing and policing such attacks.",
                "This is a chart of attacks in Western Europe since 1970 so the number of attacks are lower but the article mentioned that 2015 had above average casualty numbers.\n\n_URL_0_",
                "Islamic violence is up very much so, the ME is a wasteland of civil war and religious barbarism. Of course some people don't count brown suffering as important or relevant, so caring about Arab life is going to get you shouted down as a racist in no time flat.",
                "There's a flaw in the question which makes it difficult to answer. **How exactly do you define terrorism?** It's much harder than it seems. Try it.\n\nA plane being flown into the side of a building? A car bomb exploding in a market place? Well that's certainly terrorism, right? It's supposed to terrorize a population. \n\nWell what about when a [lone nutcase](_URL_0_) shoots a bunch of kids on an island? Or when a criminal gets into a [gunfight with police](_URL_1_) and loses control of the situation? I mean, they're terrorising innocent people right? What happens if a known terrorist organisation starts claiming that they're responsible (despite evidence saying they had nothing to do with it). Is it terrorism then?\n\nThe problem with terrorism is that it has such a low bar for entry. Sometimes only taking a single person.\n\nAlso, it heavily depends on the the bias of those building the narrative. Current western media happily hypes terrorism stories, even for someone who [fail to hurt anyone](_URL_2_). Yet ignore things like [US drone-strikes](_URL_3_), which have been responsible for hundreds of innocent civilian deaths, and absolutely inspire terror in a population.\n\nSo the answer to the question is determined entirely by how you define terrorism. \n\nIt differs depending on who you ask.",
                "The fact that we lived through the cold war and the decades later without a full scale world war is because of covert wars fought using proxies. These proxies need weapons, money and motivation. Money works well in the civilized world but religious motivation works even better and is cheaper than anything else.\n\nReligious fundamentalism is also a well tested tool. It was used in a controlled manner in remote areas to incite innocent people into fighting wars in the name of religious beliefs. \n\nIn today's world, some of this is amplified because of over-communication. If broadcasting and social media are tools for propaganda, they are supposed to be controllable by the government as well. Currently, every shithead with a smartphone can run his own misinformation campaign. Unfortunately gullible people are not smart enough to see through this. \n\nPrivately owned news media with their own interests and pursuits have also increased. \n\nSo  although the communication is louder now, the number of people killed by such covert warfare has also definitely increased.",
                "Honestly since the beginning of time we have been fighting each other over beliefs/resources/vengeance/injustice. At any point in history somewhere on the world one group was fighting another over something. Almost every group of people have been \"terrorists\" at some point. The American founding fathers were terrorists who resisted British rule. We won so now they are called \"patriots\". When Russia invaded Afghanistan and America funded trained and helped the Taliban and Osama bin Laden revolt against them they were \"freedom fighters\". Afterwards when they used their funds and training to attack America on 9/11 they became \"terrorists\" again. To answer the question more directly terrorism heroes villans are all subjective and a matter of perspective. We have always fought and committed atrocities against each other all that has changed is access to that information and the ability to watch it from safety on a ultra high Def 80 inch screen."

                "If we're willing to grant that what's happening here is that some part of the visual pathway (photoreceptor, ganglion cell, something in cortex) is being stimulated, we can answer this question by looking at how blind individuals respond to stimulation of the retina or visual cortex (either by direct electrical stimulation or by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)). In normal subjects, TMS to the primary visual cortex also produces phosphenes. \n\nFor individuals who lost their vision later in life, bypassing the photoreceptors to somehow get a signal to early visual cortex (e.g. by stimulating retinal ganglion cells directly or V1 with TMS) still produces phosphenes ([Cowey  &  Walsh, 2000](_URL_3_); [Humayun et al., 1996](_URL_1_)  < - pdf; [Gothe et al. 2002](_URL_0_)).\n\nHowever, those who are blind from birth do *not* experience phosphenes when primary visual cortex (V1) is stimulated ([Kuper et al. 2006](_URL_4_)  < - pdf!). Instead, V1 appears to be co-opted by other senses, such as tactile ones. As a result, stimulating V1 in early blind individuals can induce tactile sensations and can impair Braille reading tasks ([Ptito et al. 2008](_URL_2_)).\n\nEdit: adjusted description of cause of sensation due to radiation based on comment below"

His two illegitimate children, John Pierre Burr and Louisa Charlotte Burr, were born to a servant of Burr's from India (Wikipedia says perhaps Calcutta). It appears that both of his children later identified as black, including marrying African Americans and becoming involved in black culture, including the abolitionist movement. Of course, our modern cultural perceptions of race make a significant distinction between Indians or other non-African people with dark skin and blacks. Were Indians and other people with dark complexions (such as aboriginal people in Australia or Fijians) commonly viewed as blacks in the past? Are there other cases of Indians or other ethnic groups identifying as black in colonial or post-colonial America? Could someone in one of these groups choose how they identified or was that decided for them by their appearance/skin color? For that matter, how many Indians were there in the Americas at the time?",

                "Our racial categories are socially constructed, and not as biologically-rooted as racists like to believe. Throughout American history, there are innumerable cases of individuals who slipped through as the cracks of the black/white racial dichotomy. Interracial sex and rape were so common in antebellum America that many black people did not look black by our modern perceptions, allowing them to assimilate into white society. One interesting example are the Melungeons and Lumbee people of the upper South, groups of mixed-race people who lived in distinct communities that could not be classified as either black or white. In other cases, people who did not easily fit into either side of the American racial dichotomy were just considered black.\n\nBecause they were dark skinned, or at least born to one dark-skinned parent, Aaron Burr's children would have had blackness attributed to them despite not fitting our modern definitions (which are ostensibly based on genetics rather than appearance). Because race is defined by perception, the attribution of blackness toward Burr's children would have led them to self-identify as black. \n\nInterestingly, the descendants of South Asians workers in Louisiana helped form the Creole people - another heterogeneous ethnic group who identified as a distinct race, but were generally considered black by outsiders due to their dark appearance. This is quite similar to what happened to the Burr children."

                "The notes were named before \"keys\" (major, minor) were invented.  \nI guess you could say it's an accident that the major scale with no accidentals starts on C. ",
                "Well, A is called A because that's the one that tuning is based on. Standard tuning is A=440 Hz, but others exist (some European orchestras prefer A=432 Hz). As for \"why C major\", I couldn't tell ya man. Although, if we're gonna get technical, ABCDEFG is still diatonic, it's just a minor scale",
                "So, you're in charge of naming musical notes, several hundred years ago. The first note you name is, well, obviously, \"A\". You then name the next six notes in the scale that starts with your A, so that the scale goes A, B, C, D, E, F, G and then back to A.\n\nBut the key of A doesn't go like that: it goes A, B, C♯, D, E, F♯, G♯.\n\nAh, but that's the key of A *major*. These days, we think of the major scale is being the sort of \"default\" scale; but back a few hundred years, it was the *natural minor* scale that was considered the \"default\". And the natural A minor scale has no sharps or flats.\n\nIn other words, if you sit down at a piano and play A, B, C, D, E, F, G, A, you've just played the scale of A minor.",
                "So some of the earlier scales (ordering of notes) were the Church Modes. These were basically start at whatever letter you like and go until you reach that letter again restarting at A when you reach G. So both CDEFGABC and ABCDEFGA were scales along with any other letter you choose to start with (DEFGABCD for example). All the modes could be played using only the white notes of a piano today. \n\nAs music evolved music was based off of different scales such as the major and minor scales that are used today. These scales were based of specific \"spacings\" of notes and used notes between letters, so a note between C and D is known as C-sharp (C#) or D-flat (Db) which basically signifies a note a \"half-step\" higher than C, but not quite D or a note a \"half-step\" lower than D, but not quite C. \n\nThe C major scale in particular (CDEFGABC), when following the rules of the spacings for notes was the only major scale with no \"half-notes\" and thus, today, is very easy to teach initially when learning piano or even music theory as they only need the white notes and they don't have to worry about additional rules that came with sharps and flats in music. \n\nI'm not sure why the rules for the spacing of notes to define a scale came around but it's probably just because it sounds nice. ",
                "This goes back pretty far to chanting, when it was believed that there were 8 modes (ways to go up the scale with the same sharps/flats starting on different notes). Along came a new theorist and he proposed 12 modes, creating Aeolian and Ionian, or minor and major. \n\n(Note: Now there's 6 modes, turns out people didn't give a damn about plagal and authentic modes. For shame.) \n\nWithout sharps or flats, A to A is the Aeolian mode, or ~~major~~ minor scale (thanks /u/fr4ternity). C to C is the corresponding Ionian, or major scale. Glarean, or the magic new theorist from before, noted audaciously that the Ionian was the primary mode used. \n\nOn early instruments the distinction of where the C and A would be isn't particularly relevant but on keyed instruments it began to make sense to make the center pitch the most popular mode of the flat and sharpless scale. \n\nIn all, it's a giant game of telephone dating back to the good 'ol days of Gregorian chants. Something is bound to get wonky. (It's oddly obvious when listening to old chants that our two most popular modes weren't conceived yet. Kinda cool.) ",
                "Basically, it's because western music fell in love with major keys **after** the notes got named.\n\nWhen they started using letters, they started with 'A' to describe the lowest available note. This is the key bit here, because they didn't design the musical alphabet to match up to any particular scale.  They just said 'huh...we'll call the lowest note I can play an A'.\n\nWhen they invented the piano keyboard they used the white keys for the natural notes  &  black keys for the accidentals. \n\nThen Western music developed a particular love for Major keys, and 'C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C' happened to be the simplest one (read: the only way to construct a major scale using all natural notes).\n\nAnd so here we are.\n\nEDIT: A couple other things some folks are asking:   \n\n**Lowest note of what??**  \nBasically there was a 2-octave system in common use at the time.  They weren't trying to solve all music for all time, just write down what was in common usage.   \n\n**How did they decide what was natural  &  what was accidental??**  \nThis is another of those timing things.  The 12 note system is younger than you think - western music didn't really start agreeing there were 12 notes in an octave til the 16th century.  So we had 7 letters, then we had to decide how we were going to cram 5 more notes in there somewhere...\n\nEdit 2: Thanks for the gold kind stranger!",
                "**Why are the keys in that order?**\n\nThe piano and the precursors to it come from ~~Europe~~ Italy. ~~Europe~~ Italy used DO or Ut(C) RE(D) MI(E) FA(F) SOL(G) LA(A) SI(B) as the names of the musical notes and are taught in that order. \n\nThere's no \"order\" per se, the reason the mayor scales are played and taught starting with DO is completely subjective.\n\n**Why can't it be changed?**\n\nTake into account that you are looking into a very, very small case of music theory. \n\nFirst the piano, although an extremely important instrument, is just that, an instrument; a tool. Its layout doesn't bother a seasoned musician more than a keyboard layout bothers a programmer. \nThere are hundreds of other instruments that this change wouldn't benefit in the least. (in case you were thinking of changing the name of each note) \n\n\nSecond CDEFGAB is used by the US, UK and selected other countries, the rest of the world (~~Southern~~ Most of Europe, Latin America and Asia) uses DO RE MI FA SOL LA SI. (in case you were thinking of changing the order of the keys). \n\n\nEdit: I don't know why I went all the way to microtonal music, your question was very specific. Maybe I mixed another answer with what you were asking. Sorry. \n\n",

There's really nothing that makes any order, for instance CDEFGAB, \"the\" diatonic order of a piano, except (/u/AlienBloodMusic [explains](/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/50xk9z/eli5_why_is_the_diatonic_order_of_a_piano_cdefgab/d77sb8m)) for the general convention of Western musicians to call CDEFGAB a \"major\" scale and \"ABCDEFG\" a \"natural minor\" scale because one sounded better/happier than the other ([which is subject to cultural differences](//_URL_0_)).",
                "The order of notes on a piano does start on A, as that is the lowest note on a traditional 88-key piano. The tl;dr from there is that the notes were organized such that the natural notes are white keys, while the accidentals are black keys. This isn't specific to the piano, as there were numerous keyboard instruments before the invention of the pianoforte (modern piano).",
                "In countries where they use the Cyrillic alphabet instead of the Phoenician one, they use the Kodaly fixed do solfege.  So C is always \"do\" D is always \"re\"\n\nsource: Worked with a piano teacher who was Russian.",
                "IN THE BEGINNING... \n\n... which, for Western/European music,  means ancient Greece...\n\nthey recognized seven different musical notes (which repeated in different octaves, of course). They didn't yet call them by letters (which would have been in the Greek alphabet anyway), but those notes corresponded to the ones we call A, B, C, D, E, F, and G.\n\nWhat's important to realize is that those notes are not evenly spaced. That means that you can play the same seven notes in the same order and get seven different scales just by changing which note you start on.  The Greeks called these seven different scales \"modes\", and a given musical composition would be built around one of them. Each mode has different associations, much like the difference between major and minor keys in modern music.\n\nThe seven modes and their names are as follows:\n\nA,B,C,D,E,F,G:  Aeolian    \nB,C,D,E,F,G,A:  Locrian    \nC,D,E,F,G,A,B:  Ionian   \nD,E,F,G,A,B,C:  Dorian   \nE,F,G,A,B,C,D:  Phrygian   \nF,G,A,B,C,D,E:  Lydian   \nG,A,B,C,D,E,F:  Mixolydian   \n\nSo really, you could start anywhere naming the notes A through G without changing anything fundamental; you would just wind up with a different sequence through the same seven modes.  The way the notes happened to get named in our later history means that playing them in alphabetical order gets you Aeolian mode, which is the same as a modern natural minor key.\n\nIn modern Western music we think of the natural major key as the default, which corresponds to the Ionian mode. But that wasn't always the case; the process of Ionian dominance took about a thousand years after the notes got their letter names.\n\nThe reason we now have more notes than just those 7 is that it occurred to someone to try to play some mode starting on one of the *other* modes' start note.  For instance, if you start on B but play the Aeolian intervals, that means that the second note - in the C slot - has to be a higher frequency than C, though still lower than D.  Thus was invented \"C sharp\", written C# (or, well, C♯ in proper Unicode).  Then D and E could stay as they were (\"natural\"), but the F also had to be sharpened, and then followed by natural G and A. \n\nNow, if you try to play that same Ionian mode starting on F, you have a normal A in the third slot, but then the fourth note still needs to be lower than B.  Can't call it A♯, because you already have an A, so it gets a name based on B instead - B flat, written B♭."

                "Why are the European Middle Ages interesting?\n\nYou can frame this question many ways. Why give space to old Europe in American curricula, when thriving medieval civilizations are right outside our windows? Why bother with the problems of 1000 years ago when the problems of 100, 10, and 1 year ago explode into violence daily? Why watch Game of Thrones instead of Game of Elected Parliamentary Seats?\n\nThis is the driving question of the field of medieval studies, whether it's articulated as the justification for inclusion in school requirements or unarticulated as the compulsion to survive eight years of grad school on poverty burritos and hors d'oeuvres plundered from receptions. And in the modern history of medieval studies, going back to the 19th century, there are two basic answers: (1) the Middle Ages planted (for the classicists, I'll thrown in \"or watered\") the roots of the modern world (2) the Middle Ages are trippy, weird, and exotic.\n\nSince its original definition as an era by scholars who wished to see themselves as \"the Renaissance\", the *medium aevum* has been mirror in which the 'modern' West has defined itself. Renaissance humanists painted their claimed revival of classical antiquity next to the Middle Ages' barbaric Latin and dialectic instead of rhetoric. Reformation polemicists denounced the paganism and corruption of the age ruled by the Church. Enlightenment philosophers proclaimed their Age of Reason above the mire of medieval superstition.\n\nRevolutionary America was a little different. Already \"the other\" compared to Europe, young America saw a potential partner and justification in the Middle Ages. Well, what it (mis)understood about the Middle Ages. Myths about the grand age of pre-Norman, Anglo-Saxon democracy pop up in the writings of Founding Fathers like Jefferson. This development introduced the grand paradox of the Middle Ages: the embrace of its implied otherness as identity results in a flattening of that otherness.\n\nThe 19th century heightened this paradox. The newly rigorous, source-based scholarship in Europe developed in conjunction with rising nationalist sentiment. The Middle Ages became the fodder for the origins of *national* identity. In Europe, that meant a need to see both the 'modern' aspects *and* to draw on the power of the romantic, the emotional. In America, where the European medieval past was not as immediately obvious, Victorian-era scholars (re)defining America in the age of industrialization turned even *harder* to the romantic and weird side of the Middle Ages: \"the most foreign of worlds to the American soul,\" as Henry Adams put it.\n\nThe trauma of World War I as the first major crisis of \"modernity\" combined with a push by American scholars to achieve equal intellectuals status with European academia was probably the first major paradigm shift. Charles Homer Haskins was a dean and professor at Harvard, an actively researching medievalist--and one of Woodrow Wilson's aides at the post-WWI peace conferences. He was one of the first to see--and articulate--the need to *justify* the study of the Middle Ages. \n\nHe found it above all in the narrative of the birth of the modern state. English constitutional and legal history, to Haskins, *was* American history. It was Haskins' student Joseph Strayer who would become more famous for pushing the proto-modernity of the medieval state (...he titled one book *On the Medieval Origins of the Modern State*); Haskins is better known for building on previous hints to explode the notion of the *intellectual* Dark Ages and the birth of the modern world in the renaissance of the *sixteenth* century. The need was still for the Middle Ages to define the present, as John Manly articulated in 1930:\n\n >  The infinitely fascinating period we call the Middle Ages...lies close to *us*. In it arose our most important institutions. *Our* social customs, *our* ideals, *our* superstitions and fears and hopes, came to us *directly from this period*\n\nHe spoke as representative of the Medieval Academy of America, a scholarly group founded to grapple with the \"obscure and complex nature of medieval civilization.\" Again the paradox: are the Middle Ages the modern world, or are they fundamentally foreign? Even with the driving need to see a *likeness* in the medieval mirror, the early 20th century couldn't shake the vague feelings of distortion.\n\nThe use of medieval *institutional* history--states, universities--as the mirror of modernity kind of dissolved after World War II into the use of medieval *human* history for the same end. This is to say, a focus on mentalities and thoughts. Haskins had focused on the revival of classical Latin learning, on literature, on philosophy back in the 1920s. In the 1950s, R.W. Southern dug sideways to talk in terms of rationality, introspection, and optimism in the 12th century and beyond. (As my early medievalist colleagues will jump to point out, the reception of Southern's work resulted in the creation of the \"early Middle Ages\" as the distant barbaric past, in constrast to the proto-modern High Middle Ages.) \n\nSouthern pointed in particular to the difference between the 'fiction' literature of the early versus high Middle Ages--think Beowulf versus Arthur. We recognize in the adventurous romances our stories--emotion, relationships, paths to choose, *characters*. The epics of old are almost predestined paths of duty and honor tread by personages with names. From here, it was only a small step to the grand claim that the Middle Ages \"discovered the individual.\" This line of scholarship *explicitly* saw the medieval as the prescient modern, however different. And specifically, they saw medieval mentalities as already trending the same rational and emotional directions as their own.\n\nNaturally, this tidy understanding of a premodern modernity, different but recognizable, was about to go up in flames.\n\nAs Paul Freedman shows, the influence of postmodernism in medieval studies, specifically, had three particularly important effects that dislodged the “roots of modernity” narrative from its historiographical throne. First, it not uncoincidentally occurred in conjunction with the rise of feminist historiography/gender studies in medieval scholarship. The postmodern focus on “construction” of gender—the idea that “male” and “female” are not platonic ideals but built out of a variety of social and discursive flotsam and jetsam—led medievalists to examine how our subjects construct gender. And *damn*, but do you get into weirdness very quickly: medieval women mystics have visions of themselves drinking from Christ’s side wound like breastfeeding. Male medieval monks write themselves as the *brides* of Christ. \n\nSecond, and related, the linguistic and cultural turns shifted attention from the “actual past” to the idea that textual sources can only show *representations* of the past. In other words, we can’t actually know anything for sure. How can the Middle Ages, and the ways medieval people thought, be understood to reflect our own if we have no way to access them to understand? In this view, the Middle Ages may or may not differ fundamentally from our era *in reality*, but they are *truly* alien because we can’t even know that much!\n\nThird, postmodern throught tramples into dust the grand metanarratives of continuity, progress, and teleology—narratives on which the “medieval roots of the modern world” kind of depends.\n\nThe generation of scholars that exploded “medieval modernity” or “the modern medieval” into a strange and exotic world is now retiring or recently retired. But along the way, they have done two things.\n\nFirst, they have shown how wonderfully and terribly bonkers the Middle Ages can seem, like belief in the existence of people with the heads of dogs, or venerating nuns as holy for starving themselves and not taking baths.\n\nSecond, they have demonstrated the underlying *and understandable* rationality of these situations. Robert Bartlett shows how early medieval missionaries, unknowledgeable about the territories into which they were pushing, used the prospect of dog-headed people to work out the bounds of mission efforts. Whose souls needed saving? Within their values and worldview, this was a perfectly reasonable question. Over the course of the Middle Ages, as travelers pushed *hic sunt leones* (“here be lions”) farther and farther outwards on the map, skepticism of their existence “out there” increased. Is this not same type of question question, with horribly concrete implications for real people, that Europeans will debate at Valladolid? Caroline Bynum, most famously and importantly, showed how medieval holy women used food (fasting and Eucharist-feasting) to reenact their own belief in and experience of Christ’s Passion within the constraints of a patriarchal-to-misogynist society.\n\n[cont'd]"

                "From Wikipedia\n\nVaginal lubrication is a naturally produced fluid that lubricates a woman's vagina. Vaginal lubrication is always present, but production increases significantly near ovulation and during sexual arousal in anticipation of sexual intercourse. Vaginal dryness is the condition in which this lubrication is insufficient, and sometimes artificial lubricants are used to augment it. Without sufficient lubrication, sexual intercourse can be painful to women. **The vaginal lining has no glands, and therefore the vagina must rely on other methods of lubrication. Plasma seepage from vaginal walls due to vascular engorgement is considered to be the chief lubrication source, and the Bartholin's glands, located slightly below and to the left and right of the introitus (vaginal opening), also secrete mucus to augment vaginal-wall secretions.** Near ovulation, cervical mucous provides additional lubrication.",
                "Vaginal secretions are not the same as sexual arousal lubrication. Vaginal secretions are the product of the vagina cleaning itself, cervical mucus, etc. \n\nSexual arousal lubrication does not come from the vagina at all. It comes from outside the vagina, via the Skene's gland and perhaps the Bartholin's gland.",
                "I'd like to point out, the texture of the secretion can help a women determine when she IS ovulating WHICH could help a lot of women more carefully determine whether she wants to engage in intercouse that particular evening (or day).  More like a few days.  SO pro-tip - pay attention to your discharge as an additional form of birth control!!!  My wife learned about this and it helps us to know when to be extra careful during these few days of her cycle.  Please read up on this if you are sexually active. :D",
                "I was a researcher and guess what we all research in our spare time? Sex.\n\nThis led me to develop my own theory.  It's probably full of crap, because most of my research was done back in the 90s, but it sure as hell works.  \n\nPlease also understand that this is just about the mechanics of the female body, not their amazing minds, which are the real deciders and where the real magic happens.  If the woman is unwilling in her mind, the stimulation is unpleasant and none of this is going to work.\n\nMy theory is that a female's reproductive system is really an orgasm-sensor, and a wonderful and amazing thing to get to know.  \n\nLike all good sensor systems, the female reproductive system relies upon multiple types of sensors and signals.  \n\nThe system is even redundant, with a dedicated nerve line that nobody knew about bypassing the spine so that injured or paralyzed women can still have orgasms, too, which was discovered when brain function monitors detected orgasms in comatose women when they were being bathed.\n\nThere are numerous \"sensor\" areas that can be stimulated, including the clitoris, g-spot, and cervix, not to mention a dozen other spots not directly connected to the vaginal area that are more unique to the physiology and prior experience of the woman in question.  We'll come back to those in a minute just like you will with your gal tonight.\n\nThe stimulation of each area acts as a sort of physical confirmation that the woman is having or is about to have sex.  When enough confirmation is received, she has her orgasm, and her cervix spasms in order to collect semen from the \"collection plate\" area in the upper vagina.  \n\nSo going back to the three fun sensors I mentioned above, each has a slightly different function, I think:\n\nThe clitoris is at the front door and is designed to detect signs of penetration and perhaps more importantly a change in pace as the male undergoes his own orgasm.  Men almost automatically push harder and faster when they ejaculate, see, and the vagina looks for that.  \n\nNote that I think it is the CHANGE in activity, not necessarily its intensity, that is detected by the clitoris and other parts of the vagina.  The big bang theory usually doesn't work in bed, not without a lot of prior practice with your partner and even then it's hit or miss.\n\nThe G-spot is located about one finger-length inside on the belly-button side of the vaginal wall.  It's about the size of a dime and many women respond with stunning enthusiasm when the G-spot thinks it detects an ejaculating penis.  One can simulate this action by carefully rubbing the area with the finger, thus \"tricking\" a woman into having an orgasm without a male ejaculation, during cunnilingus, for example.  If your tongue is getting tired, stick that middle finger in there while you're working and see what happens, ha ha!  You are both likely to be pleased at the result.\n\nThe cervix doesn't seem to be nearly as important but some women seem to notice and really enjoy having the cervix gently \"tapped\" by the penis.  Or so I am told because I can't reach it myself.  I think preference for cervical stimulation may be what makes some women \"size queens\" who prefer large penises.  \n\nIf you don't have one of those, as I don't, don't sweat it because concentrating on the other two areas is far, far more important for most women, including size queens.  I've received some unusual compliments from some of those ladies, so even though I don't pack the howitzer, it's only an obstacle to a very small percentage of women.\n\nSo that's what the amazing female sexual antenna does: it detects signs of penetration, it monitors carefully for some signs that indicate the male has delivered his seed, and when confirmation is achieved either legitimately or by ruse, the woman spasms and the cervix laps up the stuff so that the boys can get to swimming up the uterus.  Mission accomplished!\n\nGood luck to you, boys and girls!  I've had excellent results applying these theories, even if they are wrong in substantive ways--and again, I am CERTAIN that some of this is incorrect.  \n\nAnd dudes, can I say something?  If you like airplanes, you read about airplanes.  If you like football, you learn about football.  \n\nI know you like sex.  So for God's sake, do the ladies a favor and LEARN ABOUT IT!  You are not inherently born with sexual prowess; you have to learn what you are doing, and some of it is book learnin', dammit.  "

There are shooters today who use this very technique for competition shooting.",
                "Funny question. A buddy and I like to shoot and we tried one day to do this with targets. Both of us used Glock 19s so there would be no advantage to either.\n\n1) He almost shot himself in the foot with his quick unholstering\n\n2) I dropped my gun (twice) upon quick unholstering\n\n3) For the first few clips, both my friend and I hit the ground with almost every round. Our wrists were not used to the recoiling so low by our hips. So you can imagine we unconsciously flexed our wrists downward to control the Glock's recoil, causing our rounds to hit the ground over and over.\n\n4) Shooting at the low level also bit the space between our thumb and index fingers when the slide recoiled to eject the bullet. Band-Aids all around.\n\n5) When we finally lifted our hands higher to shoot the target after unholstering, the timing of doing that versus whipping the gun up to see down the sight for a more accurate shot was pretty much the same timing. With practice, quick-aiming from holster to eye-sight line would be just as fast with far more accurate aiming than a hip shot.\n\n6) These were Glocks, which stabilize their kick-back with a recoil slide on the top (which does a lot to suppress the gun \"jumping\" when the round is blasted out of the chamber). There is NO FUCKING WAY we'd use a revolver like .357 Smith and Wesson or similar. The recoiled would twist our wrists at the low level and possibly cause ligament damage to our hands. Maybe a .22 caliber would work, but that's a small round in a gun fight.\n\n\nSo, if you're in a gun flight... just whip the gun up, align the sight as best you can, and pull the trigger. Don't try to be James Bond with the hip-fire bullshit. Your round will hit the ground and your wrist will hurt like fuck,  just before you get shot by your opponent.",

I can't really comment intelligently on them, so I'll mostly quote this bit from the Wikipedia article:\n\n >  Much of Applegate's instruction on point shooting involves developing a firm, consistent shooting position that allows the student to consistently hit where he is looking.  While Applegate did cover firing handguns from the hip (from a position he called the \"1/2 hip\" position), he was careful to point out that this method only worked on targets at the same level as the shooter, and only at very close range. The preferred method was to bring the handgun up to just below eye level. With the proper grip and a locked elbow and wrist, this will bring the gun to bear on the target. To reduce error in the stance, targets not directly in front of the shooter are engaged by turning the upper body at the hips, since turning the arm at the shoulder, elbow, or wrist will result in a loss of control and a miss, while turning at the waist keeps everything aligned correctly.\n\nKeep in mind this important theme from many systems of self-defense: when people think they're moments away from being killed, they adopt certain body positions, lose fine motor control, and focus their eyes on the threat, not the gunsights.  So there are many techniques that look suboptimal because they are designed to work under those circumstances.",

Plus, a prognosis is difficult, as the progress of the disease seems to depend on several factors which are, so far, rather unknown. It might depend on genetics, where it started (Hands? Legs? Somewhere else?), bodily preconditions and so on.",
                "ALS has a 4% survival rate beyond 10 years, so yeah, insane amounts of luck that he's inside that 4%. Also to answer other questions I saw below, the disease is degenerative, which means he wasn't born with it (in fact he was only diagnosed at age 21, so in 1963). At the time of diagnosis he was only expected to live a few years at most. His kids were born in 1967, 1970 and 1979. In the late 60s he was still able to move around on his own with the use of crutches. In the late 70s (so around the birth of his third child) he could still even speak (albeit it was very deteriorated). So it's not too much of a stretch to think he could get other things working as well.\n\nEDIT: I also read that his motor neuron disease is a relative of ALS, not sure what that distinction means but might also contribute to the longer lifespan.\n\n2nd EDIT: As /u/amyleeishungry and /u/mareenah point out, it doesn't directly impact sexual function, source: _URL_0_",

It's like it progressed to a specific level, then stopped.  He was told he has \"atypical ALS,\" just like Stephen Hawking.  \n\nI'm told with some victims of ALS, it progresses to a certain point, then stops.  It's quite rare among those afflicted with ALS, and even more rare are in some cases, it completely reverses itself.",

Stephen Hawking doesn't have the kind of ALS that causes the deterioration of either of those groups of muscles, which is how he survives.",

So the common way people die is of respiratory failure. And the other thing is the deterioration of swallowing muscles, and that can lead to malnutrition and dehydration. If you don't have these two things, you could potentially live for a long time—even though you're getting worse. What's happened to him is just astounding. He's certainly an outlier.",

Not to mention the more than $100,000 per year it costs in skilled nursing care and durable medical supplies. With out a ventilator the person eventually dies of hypoxia or chokes to death on saliva. With a ventilator they can live a long time in an extremely debilated condition, just like any paralyzed (quadriplegic) individual. He is an exceptional intellect with the financial resources to pay for this, or the national health insurance is paying. Suicide is a constant issue with people that have ALS. It is a horrible condition. My friend tells me that when they see their neurologist the first thing they discuss is suicidal thoughts.

ALS is a type of MND, it is a cousin of many other disorders.\n\nSaying Hawkings has ALS instead of a motor neuron disease is like saying someone owns a Ferrari because they own a car, or that he's a chimpanzee because he's a great ape.\n\nSo the reason why he has survived so long is because he doesn't have ALS, he has another kind of motor neuron disease that is not as deadly as ALS.\n\nEDIT: Here, check out classifications of Motor Neuron Diseases.

                "In medical school I worked for a month in an ALS clinic. This topic came up once or twice. The attending (a pretty big deal in the ALS world) said that while ALS that progresses and stops is not totally unheard of, it was quite unusual. He actually thought that Hawking was mis-diagnosed and what he actually had was Spinal Muscular Atrophy Type IV (adult onset SMA). It's been years since that experinece, but if I remember correctly, the difference between the two at presentation would be if there were signs of hypertonia or hypotonia, that is if the knee-jerk went up too much or didn't go up enough. SMA IV can progress for a while and then stop, leading to a clinical picture identical to Dr Hawking's.\n\nIn some ALS, with variable presentation, the hypertonia (knees up too much) is pretty mild, so the distinction can be difficult, especially without nerve or muscle tissue and special stains. I think the SMA IV entity was only first recognized as different from ALS relatively recently, so he may actually predate that, too.",

                "As a biochemistry student I did a presentation on ALS.\n\nThere are multiple kinds of ALS. The two kinds we know most about are the familial ALS (officially abbreviated fALS), which is inheritable, and the juvenile ALS (let's call it jALS), where no clear inheritable pattern has been discovered (yet). \nfALS mostly shows up around peoples mid-30's and this is the kind where (so far) nobody managed to pass 5 years after the initial diagnoses.\nThe juvenile ALS is the one that started to develope in mister Hawking's early 20's. The juvenile kind has generally been accepted as a slower kind, which means that it takes more time for the disease to reach vital organs (mr. Hawking managed so far for 40-years).\n\nI'd like to take this opportunity to explain what is (after much research) **very likely** happening on a genetic level with those who deal with fALS. \nThe first thing to understand is that we make proteins based on our genetic code. There are soo many different kinds of proteins and each and everyone has a specific function. You could consider the genetic code as a finger print for the protein. In the case of familial ALS, there is a protein called Superoxide Dismutase (SOD1) which functions as a converter of highly-damaging oxygen radicals (O2-). By converting O2- to another molecule, the radical is neutralized and loses its damaging effect. Research discovered that the DNA-region that represents SOD1 has a specific mutation in many cases of fALS. This mutation might cause the structure of the protein to change in such a way that it is less able to convert radicals (imagine a pen without its spring, it still works but is less workable). This scenario means that the O2- concentration is increasing and thus the damaging consequence...\n\nSource [1]: [ALS](_URL_0_)\nSource [2]: [SOD1](_URL_1_)\n\nI'm glad to see that more people are paying attention to this horrible disease.",

At least not that I've read.",

Addenbrookes hospital in Cambridge is not only home to world class intensive care (where he always goes) but is at the forefront of ALS treatment... and respiratory disease treatment*.\n\n3. He receives round the clock care from a team of carers.  \n\nThink about what normally kills people with ALS - failure of the muscles in the larynx to stop food material passing down into the lungs instead of the stomach and consequent pneumonia.  2 and 3 allow preventative measures and prompt, effective treatment of the above.\n\n*A certain professor will readily boast about saving Prof's life ;-)  "

                "Followup question: what would morale have been like for them?",
                "Great question! I *pray* this answer is up-to-standards. I am **not** a survivor or witness to the events in Sarajevo during the siege, however, I did study the Bosnian War in university and have since studied the siege specifically due to my personal interest in the topic.\n\nSo what was life like for the average citizen of Sarajevo during the siege? \n\nIn order to understand this experience, first it is important to examine the overarching conflict that led to the nearly four-year-long siege of Sarajevo. I'll try not to dwell too much on the causes or intricacies of the Balkan Wars as that can fill an entire post in itself, but try to focus specifically on the experience of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Sarajevo.\n\nFollowing the end of Josip Broz Tito's presidency (1945-1980) upon his death, the former Yugoslavian State (comprised of the \"six republics\" of Croatia, Slovenia, Serbia, Montenegro, Macedonia, and Bosnia-Herzegovina) began to fracture and by the early 1990's fell into armed conflict. Again, I won't go into the specifics of Yugoslavian history/politics but this is a [great paper](_URL_2_) on the factors for the country's dissolution.\n\nThe two largest ethnic groups within the area are the Serbians and Croatians, of which both live in large numbers within the borders of Bosnia-Herzegovina and thus became the focal point of conflict in order to avoid becoming the minority group within the former Yugoslavian state. What emerged was the Republika Srpska/Serb Republic (comprised mainly of ethnic Serbs) and the newly independent Bosnia-Herzegovina. This point centered directly on Sarajevo, the capital and largest city of Bosnia-Herzegovina (comprised of a mix of Bosnians/Croats/Serbians/Muslims).\n\nBy April 5th, 1992, divisions of the JNA (remains of Yugoslavia's military) comprised of ethnic Serbs living in Bosnia, renounced their allegiances to Bosnia-Herzegovina and merged with the newly created Serbian Republic Army (VRS), surrounding the capital of Sarajevo, and trapping the numerous but under-equipped Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina (ARBiH)  with approximately, \"two-hundred-sixty tanks, one-hundred-twenty mortars, and innumerable anti-aircraft cannons, sniper rifles, and other small arms.\" (5)\n\nSo what was life like for the average citizen? That depends largely on **when** and **where**.\nThe following is meant to be a projection of what you as a citizen of Sarajevo may have thought and felt regarding the siege around you. Since the nature of the question seems to ask directly about the life of the \"average citizen\" I'll try and keep it generic, yet accurate as possible. All events and references are sourced at the bottom.\n\nLet's pretend it's two years into the siege, April 5th, 1994. You remember how two years ago the country seemed to split along its seams after Bosnia-Herzegovina declared its independence and Serbian armed forces began setting up barricades and roadblocks on all the routes in and out of the city. \n\n[It seems laughably naive now, however at the time, the notion of a siege was almost unthinkable amidst the calls for solidarity and the arrival of the Blue Helmeted UNPROFOR Peacekeepers. You laugh thinking about the community *barricade-BBQ* and the large banner that read \"Neighbors before Brothers\" over the city parliament. There had been a moment of hope in those early days, when talks were in order and the European Community passed a referendum supporting Bosnia-Herzegovina's sovereignty while attempting to establish conciliatory talks between the now warring factions. Some residents left, taking advantage of the few buses or flights available before the complete blockade, but many of Sarajevo's 500,000 citizens remained; rooted in the safety of their homes and the booming echo of gunshots from the mountains surrounding the city.](_URL_1_)\n\nAfter the VRS took control of the airport, and reestablished the barricades, all of the fuel ran out. Then the electricity, then the heat, and then the water. Soon food and medicine became a memory, except for what you could get from aid-packages or steal. You remember when the President spoke on RT-Sarajevo, asking all able-bodied men to fight in defense of their country. Whispers and rumors flew throughout the homes and offices of all those trapped within the valley when the reality of the war became true to you all. A peace rally led by citizens across the *Vrbanja* bridge ended with snipers killing the two students [Suada Dilberović and Olga Sučić for in whose memories](_URL_3_), the bridge was renamed. Was it the same day or the day after when the [Bosnian/Serbian couple, Admira Ismić and Boško Brkić (NSFW)](_URL_4_) were also killed by snipers crossing the *Vrbanja* bridge? \n\nWhenever it was, that was the day you learned to tread with care through \"[Sniper's Alley](_URL_0_),\" and to take heed of the wisdom that \"if you can see the peaks of the surrounding hills, they too can see you.\" (5)\n\nThe shelling and gunfights all across the city was never anything you truly became accustomed to, but due to the staunch resistance of the ARBiH, the VRS responded with [200](_URL_6_) shells landing across the city *daily*. And that was a quiet day. Most of those injured or killed are due to the shelling. By this time in 1994, some [2,160](_URL_5_) people have been killed by artillery alone, and since Suada and Olga and Admira and Boško, [699](_URL_5_) people have been shot by hidden snipers, concealed in ruined apartments or among the trees upon the ever looming mountains. You didn't know them at all, but by now there isn't a person in Sarajevo who hasn't heard of them, and the countless others.\n\n**CONTINUED BELOW**"

                "Technically, the weights are supposed to represent synaptic strength / strength of connections between neurons. However, ANNs don't really resemble the brain in any meaningful way...",
                "Neurons in a brain interact through synapses. Almost every neuron has an \"Input\" which are dendrites and an \"Output\" which is the axon. Synapses are the connections of the axon of a neuron with the dendrites of another neuron. \n\nA signal that comes from the first neuron, is translated into an amount of chemicals (neurotransmitters) and released into the synapse, where it is absorbed into the dendrites of the other neuron. There an electrical response forms. The strength of the response depends on a number of factors, such as amount of neurotransmitter released, number of receptors in the synapse, type of neurotransmitter, are certain other chemicals blocking the receptors or binding the neurotransmitter and more complex stuff. \n\nThe weight in an artificial neural network is a simplification of all these factors. \n\nIn a biological neuron the neurotransmitters cause chain reaction in the dendrites, which produces electric signals to travel from the synapse to the cell body. Electric signals from all ingoing synapses of a neuron are \"summed up\" in the cell body and create a response of the neuron that travels though its axon to the next neurons. For this response to have significant impact on the next neurons, it has to be strong enough. \n\nIn an artificial neuron ingoing signals are simply numbers. They are multiplied by the corresponding weight of the synapse and then summed up. If the result is larger than the bias the artificial neuron will create a response (typically 1) if it is smaller than the neuron will return 0 (sometimes -1). \n\nThis is a rough sketch of the most important stuff (I believe) so if something is not clear or if you have more questions feel free to ask."

                "He was a professor of Language and Literature for 14 years, plus he loved languages in general. Some sources say his fiction was written just so he'd have an excuse to use his constructed languages.",
                "He wasn't the only person to create languages. In fact people are still doing it for fun and profit.  The Dothraki language was created for HBO when they started filming Game of Thrones.  The languages are called constructed languages or conlangs. Check out /r/conlangs for more information.",
                "the ELI5 reason is that he was a genius. Many people here are right, Sindarin and Quenya are based on welsh and finnish. And Tolkien was one of the most talented linguists of his generation.\n\nThe anecdote that I've heard about Tolkien sums up on what level he could handle languages. He was raised Catholic so the school he went to was run by nuns. He was preparing for a talent show in the school working on giving a speech in ancient greek. A couple of days before the performance one of the nuns thinks he would like to take a look at some old gothic texts as well. For the performance he gave a perfect oration of the speech he had been working on and greatly impressed the other students and teachers. He then went into a second speech, in perfect gothic, surprising everyone. ",
                "The reason he wrote his books was to give a background context for his languages, not the other way around. i.e. His passion was languages first not books. ",
                "Tolkien never put down enough vocabulary for the languages to be spoken fluently. \n\n\nWhat he did was to create roots from which he constructed his words, as well as a huge number of 'historical changes' to these roots and how they influenced the words. This enabled him - and us, even after his death - to easily reconstruct what words might/should have looked like, thus creating a huge vocabulary over the years.\n\n\nTo give you an example, I will now invent a root for a fantasy language, let's say, ***-olp***, which signifies words having to do with 'stone'. Also rules in my language are that nouns begin with 'd' and verbs end with 'a'. So a stone might be ***dolp*** while 'stoning' could be ***olpa***, and so forth.\n\nAnother root in my language is ***-yit***, a word that signifies 'using' and derivatives. 'Dyit' would be 'a use' or could be interpreted as 'a tool'. \n\nBecause I have these roots and rules how to construct certain types of words, I don't have to invent a word for, say, 'hammer', because a hammer could be ***dolpyit*** (=stone-tool). \n\nIt took me 2 minutes to come up with these simple roots and rules with which you could already construct simple phrases by extrapolation. Tolkien worked *decades* on his languages. \n\nAfter my death, people could use my roots and my rules to construct all the words they need. Worst case scenario, you have to invent new roots. Because Tolkien also gave historical background, even the construction of roots is possible. That's what they did for the Sindarin in the movies, for example.\n\nBecause Tolkien was a philologist and a linguist, he had a very precise understanding of how languages work and, more importantly, how they develop. With Sindarin and Quenya, he provided enough rules, roots and examples for a language to develop semi-naturally. But even his languages Khuzdul or Westron allow for some reconstruction and phrasing, because he provided all the basic elements.",
                "Aside from it being Tolkien, there is an accepted theory of \"Universal Grammar\" This states that there are a set amount of rules that govern all languages, this includes everything about all languages. Each language essentially pick and chooses which elements of UG it takes. For example the English sentence order is Subject Verb Object (SVO) where as other languages have different orders than this, i cant remember any specific examples off the top of my head (its Christmas eve, im a few bevs in, give me a break.) All languages also use subject, verbs and objects, but certain things change around such as how plurals, past tense (French even has an extra poast tense for really old stuff, like a super past tense) etc can all be changed and mixed within the rules you choose of the language. \n\nThere are also other rules that run along with this, for example \"The mens urinal theory\" say there are 5 urinals represented by these 0's\n\n* 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThe theory goes vowels, much like men in a urinal try to cover as much sound range (phonetics) between them as possible, which is why languages with 3 vowels can function just as well as those with 5 or more, for examples, if there was two vowels it would look like this:\n\n* X 0 0 0 X\n\nthree:\n\n* X 0 X 0 X\n\nOnce you understand all these rules, and what combinations are possible etc, technically anyone can begin to form their own language, you only have to look at the variations between all the different languages already existing to see what is actually possible, there is click languages, and even a whistle language! (I cant remember where, its somewhere very mountainous, basically it developed because the whistles travelled better around the mountains than shouting.)\n\nNone of these takes away from the immense, time, effort and dedication would take to start to form your own language, but when you know the logic behind it, it is possible. \n\nsorry if this isnt the answer you wanted, i like attempting to put my degree to use now and then! \n\nEdit: I know this isnt Tolkien specific, but it gives an idea about how a language can me created.

                "Indo-European mythology is positively replete with the \"sacred twin\" trope.  It is seen in Romulus and Remus and Tacitus makes not of Germanic worship of two twin deities that he compares to Castor and Pollux.  These figures are also often commonly associated with horses, see J.P. Mallory's *In Search of the Indo-Europeans*.\n\nIn Anglo-Saxon England, there are the famous figures of Horsa and Hengist (meaning roughly Horse and Stallion) who were supposedly the leaders of the Anglo-Saxon invasion of England, according to Bede.  These two brothers were supposedly the ring leaders of the Anglo-Saxon migration to England.  Where once having reached the island they eventually set about carving out their own realms in Britain.  Hengist and Horsa were both credited with having founded the Kingdom of Kent in south eastern England.\n\nInterestingly, they are also found in other sources besides just Bede.  Hengist is mentioned in Beowulf as a leader of the Frisians iirc, though his counter part is absent. \n\nWhile these figures are unlikely to have ever actually existed as war band leaders, and the whole debate around the Anglo-Saxon migration to England is very fraught with debate, these two figures are one of the many iconic duos of the Middle Ages. \n",
                "I love the story of Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz and their historic duel over who invented calculus. They both, independently, developed the fundamental concepts of calculus: infinitesimals, integration, and derivatives. \n\nIsaac Newton indisputably invented it first. But, he was a weird dude. He hoarded knowledge like a dragon hordes gold. He didn't share his contributions for two reasons. First, he wanted to keep his sacred knowledge to himself. Two, he was cripplingly afraid of receiving criticism, so he tended to keep things close until years and, sometimes decades, of refinement. \n\nLeibniz, on the other hand, went out of his way to promote his candidacy for father of calculus. He published his framework of calculus before Newton. In fact, it was only after Leibniz published his work and might have made a name for himself as the discoverer of calculus that Newton came forward with his own notes, proofs, and documents showing he, in fact, discovered it first.\n\nThus set off a feud of epic proportions between these two giants of mathematics. It got so bad that Leibniz appealed to the Royal Society to declare in his favor once and for all. But the Royal Society, *which was headed by Newton,* declared in Newton's favor!\n\nIt should be noted, and history has come to view it as such, that Leibniz did at least as much for calculus as Newton. His was the one that took off and was popularized. The concepts and framework of calculus we learn in school and use daily as scientists and engineers come from Leibniz's formulation, not Newton's. And it was he, not Newton, that published it as such and popularized it so that others could build off of it. Newton, an indisputable genius, possibly the smartest man to have ever existed, did it in his typically Newton way, comprehensible only to his unique mind.\n\nIf you are interested in this in more depth and to Isaac Newton more generally (a ridiculously fascinating man), I cannot recommend enough Edward Dolnick's \"The Clockwork Universe: Isaac Newton, the Royal Society, and the Birth of the Modern World\"",
                "Duos are hard to talk about in the context of the later Qing Dynasty. In an autocratic state with clearly stratified bureaucratic hierarchies, well-recorded instances of outright equal partnership are hard to come by. In the Taiping period, for example, neither Li Xiucheng and Chen Yucheng (Taiping) nor Zeng Guofan and Li Hongzhang (loyalist) cooperated very actively; perhaps it would usually be better to talk of dualities as opposed to partners in crime - Hong Xiuquan and the Xianfeng Emperor, Charles Elliot and Lin Zexu (and later Kishan), etc.\n\nOh wait. There is one particularly infamous duo we can talk about, and that's because they were neither Chinese nor officials. William Jardine and James Matheson. The first of those names should sound familiar to anyone who's spent more than 24 hours on Hong Kong Island, with sites like Jardine House, Jardine's Lookout, Jardine's Bazaar etc. named after him. Matheson, sadly, has got the short end of the stick, although there is a Matheson Street in Causeway Bay.\n\nJardine Matheson and Co. ended up being the largest Western trading firm in southern China by a long shot, and their involvement in the opium trade in particular is, well, shall we say... *well-documented*. Both Scotsmen, Jardine had been a doctor before changing careers, Matheson was a trader all along, and the two began a partnership in the 'country trade' between India and China in 1820 after a chance meeting in Mumbai.  Eternal agitators in the 'free trade' camp, they were part of the general move to abolish the East India Company's monopoly on trade with China in 1833, and as fellow Scotsmen were able to gain the ear of Lord Napier, the first Superintendent of Trade, and get him to take a hardline stance towards the Chinese authorities in Guangdong the next year. This backfired, of course, but few consequences were suffered. 1838 saw Jardine retire back to the UK, whilst Matheson stayed behind. This proved most fortuitous in 1838, when Imperial Commissioner Lin Zexu was dispatched to suppress the opium trade at Canton and threatened the leading opium smuggler with arrest. As Jardine Matheson and Co. was colloquially only known by the first part of its name, Matheson avoided any serious consequence and it would be the proprietor of the #2 firm in the opium business, one Lancelot Dent, who would be taken in for questioning.\n\nWith Matheson in China, Jardine was one of the main lobbyists for war back in Britain, and, just as he had gained the ear of Lord Napier, he also got into favour with the foreign secretary, Lord Palmerston. Jardine's suggestions about the viability of war and the potential aims thereof are eerily echoed in the actual activities of both Lord Melbourne's Whig government and Sir Robert Peel's Tory cabinet regarding China in the conflict that ensued. One interesting note is that Jardine successfully convinced Palmerston that Britain should *not* make the forced legalisation of opium in China one of its war aims. The position in favour of such action was already quite an unpopular one; and moreover Jardine and Matheson had so streamlined the process of smuggling opium that their existing infrastructure and business model were optimised for it, and so a transition to legitimate trade might have been a serious threat to their competitive edge. \n\nUltimately, Britain did win the war. Jardine Matheson set up shop in Hong Kong, and their presence can still be felt in many places on the island. The current HQ at Jardine House, with its distinctive circular windows, was once the tallest building on the waterfront. A company employee operates the Noonday Gun at the Causeway Bay Typhoon Shelter, which fires a single blank every day at 12 p.m. To say anything of the history of Hong Kong without accounting for the firm that this duo set up is virtually impossible. Is this necessarily a good thing? Well...\n\nWhilst there are histories of Jardine Matheson and Co. as a whole, for an accessible book which covers their pre-Opium War activities see Stephen Platt, *Imperial Twilight* (2018).\n\nAdditionally, a couple of other bits of trivia relevant to Jardine and Matheson but not so much to duos (unless you count two people doing the same sort of thing or even just interacting as a duo):\n\n* At the time of the General Election of 1832 (the first after the passing of the Great Reform Act), UK constituencies generally returned two MPs to the Commons. Lord Palmerston would end up being elected MP for Hampshire South alongside the younger George Leonard Staunton, the former *taipan* for the East India Company at Canton (and hence in direct opposition to Jardine and Matheson). As a boy, Staunton had learned Chinese, presumably Mandarin, while accompanying his father on the ill-fated Macartney mission, one of the few real highlights of which was his briefly conversing with the Qianlong Emperor during the audience at Jehol.\n\n* Lord Melbourne's cabinet did not consist only of himself and Lord Palmerston. The Secretary at War during the Whig phase of the Opium War was a certain Thomas Babington Macaulay (better known as the author of *The History of England* and probably one of the most notable popular historians ever to write in the English language).",
                "One duo I love from fashion history is quite obscure: the Boué sisters (Boué Soeurs), Sylvie Montegut and Jeanne d’Etreillis. Their trademark was the use of light and airy fabrics, particularly sheer chiffons, mousselines de soie, and lace, and embellishment with ribbons and silk flowers. While they were active from 1899 to the 1930s, hardly anyone has heard of them today. (Few extant garments from their early years survive, so the two are associated more strongly with the 1920s.) They attempted to reopen after World War II, but closed in the early 1950s.\n\nI have never been able to find out much about them in either primary or secondary sources. In an article she wrote for *Arts  &  Decoration* in 1922, Jeanne stated that the sisters had begun to sew clothing for their dolls at a young age, and then progressed to making dresses for themselves. They opened their house at 9 Rue de la Paix when they were about eighteen, and by 1902 they could be listed alongside established greats such as Worth, Doeuillet, Redfern, and Lacroix. Most of their extant pieces, however, date to after 1914, when they opened a branch at 13 W56th St. in New York. According to Jeanne, they met immediately with success there - despite a mild scandal in 1915, in which the sisters illegally imported some of their French workers, who in turn illegally brought over couture gowns and declared them at customs as their own property. A year later, they brought their own case to court, prosecuting Hickson Incorporated, who bought one of their outfits and was promising to sell copies of it: a common problem for couture houses at the time. Apart from this, I've found a number of their pieces in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and some fashion plates in French publications, but there has been very little research done on them as a business. (You can see some examples of each on my blog [here](_URL_0_), which I've cribbed from shamelessly for this post.)",
                "Zoroastrianism, as is probably familliar, was probably founded by the prophet Zarathustra, some time in the 1300:s BC or so. The only records that survive from this time are the _Gathas_, the seventeen great hymns of Zarathustra. They are incredibly obscure and difficult to read, but within them we find a few mentions of perhaps the second most significant character in the early history of the tradition - Zarathustra's great patron Vishtaspa. Yasna 12, a creed with its roots probably in the time immediately following Zarathustra's death, obliges the convert to recite, among other things:\n\n > As the belief of the waters, the belief of the plants, the belief of the well-made (Original) Cow; as the belief of Ahura Mazda who created the cow and the Asha-endowed Man; as the belief of Zarathushtra, **the belief of Kavi Vishtaspa,**\n\nIndeed, Zarathustra's lament in Yasna 46 takes a turn in verse 14:\n\n > 1. To what land shall I go to flee, whither to flee? From nobles and from my peers they sever me, nor are the people pleased with me [......], nor the Liar rulers of the land. How am I to please thee, Mazda Ahura?\n\n > ...\n\n > 14. O Zarathushtra, what righteous man is thy friend for the great covenant? Who wills to have good fame? It is the Kava Vishtaspa at the consummation. Those whom thou wilt unite in one house with thee, these will I call with words of Good Thought.\n\nBut Vishtaspa is a terribly obscure character in the early material, mentioned only three or four times. \"Kava\" or \"Kavi\" is a title that according to Boyce suggests training in the mantric tradition (hence, a cleric of some sort); others suggest a translation along the lines of \"prince\". Later tradition holds that he was a king; it appears by Yasna 46 that Vishtaspa must have been a nobleman, chieftain or in some other position of tribal power to protect Zarathustra; this need not be exclusive with being a cleric, of course. Later references to him as \"king\" reflects perhaps shifting social structures and understandings of the roles of priests, warriors and kings.\n\nThe most extensive treatment of Vishtaspa in Avestan is found in the [Vistasp Yasht](_URL_1_) (Hymn to Vishtaspa). It begins with a long series of blessings given by Zarathustra to Vishtaspa that go on for some dozen verses along the lines of:\n\n > 'Give him strength and victory! Give him welfare in cattle and bread!' thus said Zarathushtra to the young king Vishtaspa! 'Give him a great number of male children, praisers [of God] and chiefs in assemblies, who smite and are not smitten, who smite at one stroke their enemies, who smite at one stroke their foes, ever in joy and ready to help.\n\nThe middle portion presents Zarathustra as the mentor of young Vishtaspa, teaching him the ways of spirituality:\n\n > Zarathushtra said: 'O young king Vishtaspa! Invoke Ahura Mazda, who is full of Glory, Ahura Mazda, and the sovereign Heaven, the boundless Time, and Vayu who works highly.\n > 'Invoke the powerful Wind, made by Mazda, and Fate.\n > 'Repeat thou those words, that the god invoked may give thee the boon wished for; that thou, strong, and belonging to the creation of the good Spirit, mayest smite and take away the Druj and watch with full success those who hate thee; smite down thy foes, and destroy at one stroke thy adversaries, thy enemies, and those who hate thee.\n\nAnd alludes to Vishtaspa as an ideal ruler to be emulated (the difficulty of translating even younger Avestan texts is evident in the first line):\n\n > 'He wields his power according to the wish of Ahura Mazda, the Good Spirit, and for the destruction of the Evil Spirit, whichever of two men goes quicker to perform a sacrifice (to Ahura); but if he chooses to perform the sacrifice and prayer to us not in the right way, he does not wield the right power, he will not reign.\n\n > 'He will receive bad treatment in the next world, though he has been the sovereign of a country, with good horses to ride and good chariots to drive. Give royalty to that man, O Zarathushtra! who gives royalty unto thee with good will.\n\nThere is a classic moral to the story here, of course - one may be wealthy on Earth, but poor in spirit, and that will be reflected in the world after death. Indeed, even a king is obliged to perform the correct rites to maintain purity and keep away the forces of evil. It seems to end on a rhetorical note:\n\n > Spitama Zarathushtra said to the young king Vishtaspa: \"To what land shall I turn, O Ahura Mazda? To whom shall I go with praying?'\n\nHowever, its 60-odd verses are not an easy or very coherent read, and it appears that various fragments and words of wisdom that are only tangentially related have been inserted at the end, with the above-quoted line inserted to tie it all together.\n\nWhile generally taken to have been a historical person, there is not much we can learn about Vishtaspa. The later Avestan material almost seems to invert the relationship between the duo, where Zarathustra's teaching of Vishtaspa takes precedence over Vishtaspa's protection of Zarathustra. The young king comes to take on several roles - one as a role-model for rulers, and another as a pious man who listened to the teachings of the clergy. Vishtaspa sometimes almost functions like the narrative device of an audience substitute - while a prince, he is someone to whom the average Zoroastrian could put themselves in the shoes of, the first who received the education in the Good Religion that would be passed on through the priesthood and (at least in theory) taught to lay members.\n\nIn this way, he plays an invaluable role in the tradition, in bringing the incredibly exalted Zarathustra closer to the believer.\n\nSources and further reading:\n\n[Encyclopedia Iranica entry](_URL_0_)\n\n_Zoroastrians: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices_ by Mary Boyce (1979)\n\n[Vishtasp Yasht](_URL_1_)\n\nVarious chapters in _Wiley-Blackwell Companion to Zoroastrianism_ (2015)",
                "(1/2)\n\n**An Englishman and a Boy**\n\nIn 1693 there was an account published by a ship's mate named Robert Lyde explaining in extraordinarily graphic detail how after being captured by French privateers in 1692, he, along with a 16-year-old junior sailor, retook the ship through mutiny, killing two of their 7 captors with a crowbar, a marlin-spike and a knife, and badly wounding two others who later died, before taking the rest prisoner. \n\nRobert Lyde was 23 years old in 1692 and this took place during the Nine Years' War (1688-1697) between England and France. Three years earlier, in 1689, Lyde had been captured by French privateers and taken as a prisoner to France where he was held at the port of Dinan for four months as a POW with other English sailors, during which time he says he endured extreme deprivation and starvation that he compares to slavery by the \"Turks\" in North Africa. He says most of his shipmates died from disease or malnutrition and only 200 of 600 prisoners were eventually exchanged. Lyde says it took him 14 weeks or three and a half months to recover basic strength after returning to England. While held in these terrible conditions, the English prisoners were offered the chance to enlist in French service as privateers against England which Lyde says he saw 17 of them agree to do and they were kept in a separate room. Lyde was not one of these and his account displays extreme English nationalism and Protestantism that might explain it. His time as a POW seems to have made a big impact on him and throughout his account he refers back to it bitterly (in one place entertaining a revenge fantasy that he would like to do to French prisoners what they did to him). After returning to England, he resolved never be held prisoner in France again. \n\nIn September 1691, after having fully recovered, Lyde signed on as a mate for a small trading voyage to Oporto in Portugal. While returning to England on February 29, 1692, they sighted a much larger French privateer and had no choice but to surrender since they only had 8 crew. Throughout the voyage Lyde had told the captain that if they were captured by the French he would try to retake the ship so as not to be a prisoner in France again. As the French privateer now approached, Lyde got a blunderbuss and hid it in the hold by some wine barrels. His captain was understandably very pessimistic that this would work and told Lyde it was an \"impossible thing to be done.\" Lyde allegedly replied: \"Although it seems to you to be so; yet nothing is impossible to be effected by God, in whom I put my trust.\" \n\nThe French privateers then searched the ship and the captain gave them his money purse. The privateers then took 6 of the Englishmen including the captain into their ship and put 7 of their own men on the English ship along with Lyde and a 16-year-old boy named John Wright. After the French ship had gone out of sight, Lyde offered to bring up a barrel of wine in hopes of getting the Frenchmen drunk. He did this but none of them ever drank much. For the next several days Lyde brooded about how to retake the ship and tried repeatedly to convince the boy to help him, telling him what terrible things awaited as a prisoner in France, but the boy was scared at being so badly outnumbered and refused. Lyde and the boy were often told by the Frenchmen to help man the ship and especially to help pump water out of the hold because the ship was leaky, but Lyde says he usually refused unless he felt like it. Lyde's plans to retake the ship with his hidden blunderbuss didn't work out as the Frenchmen found it and kept it in the cabin. On March 4, Lyde tried again to convince the boy to join him in mutinying while two of the Frenchmen were working the pumps but the boy still refused. Then Lyde began sharpening his knife and said he wouldn’t use it again until he had cut the Frenchmen's throats which scared the boy so that he went away:\n\n >  Then I took a brick and whetted my knife upon it; and told the boy, \"I would not use my knife, upon any account, till I was carried into France; except it were to cut the throats of the Frenchmen.\"\n\n >  At which words, the boy startled as if his own throat had been cutting; and then left me, and went up on deck. \n\nBy this time the ship was close to the French coast and the crew fired a blank shot as a signal for another ship to come guide them. When Lyde came on deck after this he found the Frenchmen \"as joyful as I was melancholy.\" Then he was overcome with something like a PTSD flashback and remembered his former time as a POW:\n\n >  Then considering the inhuman usage I had formerly had in France, and how near I was to it again; it struck me with such terror that I could stay no longer upon deck: but went down betwixt decks, and prayed to God for a southerly wind, to prevent her going into that harbour; ... \n\nThe wind did turn south and ship was not able to enter the harbor. That night and the next morning (March 5) the wind drew them further from France and the French port. At noon, Lyde was called up to man the pumps (which he had often refused), but they yelled at him several times and he finally went up only to tell them he had been a prisoner in France already and if he was taken there again \"I should serve three years.\" The French captain sarcastically replied \"That is bien\" and Lyde then said he had nothing to lose and if they tried to force him instead of manning the pumps then the ship would sink. \n\nThat night Lyde didn't sleep much as he stayed up trying to persuade the boy to join him in retaking the ship which the boy still refused. When he did sleep a little, Lyde says he dreamed that he was attacking the Frenchmen, \"For sleeping or waking, my mind ran still upon the attacking of them.\" At 7:00 AM the next morning (March 6), Lyde sent the boy up on deck to check the direction of the wind and he reported it was still in the direction of England. Lyde then continued unsuccessfully trying to convince the boy the join him in attacking the Frenchmen before deciding to do it himself if he had to. At 8:00 AM he took a drink of wine and went on deck where he saw the Frenchmen eating breakfast around the cabin table and they invited him to join them. Lyde accepted but immediately became very nervous from adrenaline and made an excuse to go back below saying he was sick:\n\n >  At eight in the morning, all the Frenchmen sat round the cabin table at breakfast, and they called me to eat with them. Accordingly I accepted their invitation, but the sight of the Frenchmen did immediately take away my stomach and made me sweat as if I had been in a stove, and was ready to faint with eagerness to encounter them. Which the Master perceiving, and seeing me in that condition, asked me in French, \"If I was sick?\" and because he should not mistrust anything, I answered \"Yes.\" But could stay no longer in sight of them, and so immediately went down betwixt decks, to the boy; ...\n\nLyde then tried *again* to convince the reluctant boy to help him attack the Frenchmen while they ate breakfast and detailed a plan of attack, but the boy still refused and Lyde had second thoughts about attempting it himself. Soon the Frenchmen finished breakfast and Lyde berated the boy for not agreeing to help him, saying by this time they would have had the ship under their control, but the boy replied that actually they would have both been killed. At 8:30 AM two of the Frenchmen went on deck to pump water (they had a man keeping time with an hour glass and every half hour they had to pump water from the leaky ship). Lyde checked that the wind was still toward England and then again tried to convince the boy to join him, telling him again of his miserable conditions as a prisoner in France. The boy at last said that if it was really so bad in France then he would join the French as a privateer, which made Lyde quite angry:\n\n >  These words of his struck me to the heart, which made me say, \"You dog! what! will you go with them against your King, and country, and father and mother? Sirrah! I was in France, a prisoner four months, and my tongue cannot express what I endured there; yet I would not turn a Papist and go with them! Yet they came daily persuading me and others to go out; and, the time I was there, I think 17 turned Papists, and were kept in a room by themselves; but God was pleased to make an example of them; for I think 12 of them died while I was there. And if thou dost turn Papist, thou mayest fare as they did! and if thou, or any of them that be turned, be ever taken again, you will certainly be hanged in England by the law! But I had the command of a Privateer, and should take my brother in a French Privateer, after he had willingly sailed with them, I would hang him immediately!\""

                "Please indulge me, in my tryptophan-induced daze, as I very briefly review the essentials of Roman nomenclature. During the late Republic and early Empire, male Roman citizens typically (but by no means always) had three names - a praenomen (personal name), nomen (clan name), and cognomen (family name). So in the name Gaius Julius Caesar, Gaius is the praenomen, Julius the nomen, and Caesar the cognomen. Roman women in the same period generally had to make do with a single name, the feminine form of their father's nomen. Thus, Gaius Julius Caesar's daughter was named Julia, as was every other female representative of the Julian clan. Whence this interesting question.\n\nPublicly, women were often distinguished by the names of their fathers or husbands. If a certain Julia, for example, was married to a member of the Metellus family, she might be known as Julia Metelli (Metellus' Julia). Alternatively, she might be differentiated from her younger sister by being called Julia Maior (Julia the elder) or Julia Prima (First Julia). Her sister, accordingly, would be Julia Minor (Julia the younger) or Julia Secunda (Julia no. 2).\n\nBut those conventions were designed for public contexts. In private, closely-related women with the same name probably referred to one another by nicknames. On the basis of our sparse evidence, affectionate terms like Livilla (Lil' Livia) or Julitta (Little Julia) seem to have been common. Family members might call a beautiful girl or woman \"Venus\" (e.g. Sen., *Apocl*. 8), or a musically-talented lady \"Musa\" (muse). Other nicknames, we may safely assume, were equally descriptive and less flattering. \n\nRelatives who did not know each other well may have sidestepped the whole name issue by referring to one another as \"sister\" or \"dearest soul,\" as in the famous [letter of Claudia Severa](_URL_0_) from the Roman fort at Vindolanda.",
                "They likely aren't going to all go by Julia alone. Female naming conventions shift and change throughout the centuries of Rome, and there is the issue of the scant amount of data for female names when compared to male, but for the moment, let's look at an early Imperial example. \n\nThe two daughters of Gaius Octavius (father of Augustus) were known as Octavia Maior and Octavia Minor. Often sisters had a nominal marker related to birth order to avoid confusion. (If not minor/maior, then secunda, tertia, etc)\n\nAnother example is found a little farther down the line. The daughter of Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus (The emperor Augustus) was known as Julia Caesaris filia (Julia daughter of Caesar, also sometimes rendered Julia Augusti filia) and was married to Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa. They had two children, neither of whom were referred to as Vipsania as might be expected but rather Julia and Agrippina. Farther down, this Agrippina (known to history as 'the elder')had three daughters of her own with Germanicus Julius Caesar. These daughters, while all having Julia as part of their name, are not known (at least to history and likely to their contemporaries) as a series of Julias but rather as Agrippina ('the younger' to history), Drusilla, and Livilla. \n\nIt is unlikely that all of these women in your scenario would have all gone simply by Julia."

                "Surface tension isn't what kills you, it's the liquid's viscosity. Liquids are able to \"slip past\" themselves, which is why they're shapeless, but they can only do it so quickly. If the liquid suffers a very sudden disturbance (like a human body impacting its surface at  > 200 km/h), there may not be enough time for the momentum to disperse. The liquid nearest to the disturbance then becomes compressed because the liquid immediately in front won't \"get out of the way\" quickly enough. The problem is that the compressed layer of liquid pushes in all directions, including back towards the disturbance, so the body is crushed inwards on impact.\n\nWhile there are differences in viscosity among liquids, the difference between water and oil is not very large, and there wouldn't be a significant difference. The oil would make it slightly more survivable, but only technically. You could break a fall if the viscosity of the medium changed gradually, but the change from air to water (or pretty much any gas to a liquid) is too sudden.\n\nEdit: If the falling person were really, really lucky, they could fall into a patch of water where a massive gas leak (such as methane) were happening. If the water is sufficiently filled with tiny bubbles, that could work, since the mixture would behave as a liquid with lower viscosity, I believe.\n\nEdit edit: Now I am unsure of my answer (see below). If anyone with a good amount of knowledge in fluid dynamics could clear things up, I'd highly appreciate it. "

But in any case, the gamma radiation is like light, once the flash / explosion is over, the gamma radiation is over, too.  Items (dirt, dust, air, buildings, whatever) don't \"hold\" gamma radiation, they don't become radioactive that way.\n\nThe explosion also \"explodes\" the radioactive metal in the bomb (plutonium, uranium), and the little fragments and dust that form from that ARE radioactive and can stay radioactive for a long time.  \n\nSo, basically, the amount of radioactive dust / material that forms is in the cloud of the explosion, and if it's in a desert environment where it doesn't get into the water streams / isn't carried away by clouds or strong winds, it'll just settle in the limited area around the explosion, and make the ground there radioactive.\n\nSo, TLDR, increased rate of cancer = because the radiation levels are high for the ground / sand in the area.  But \"no major environmental impacts\" = because there isn't a high density of animals, plants, or people in the area to be affected by the radiation.",

They can kill people within miles of a bomb, and that is unthinkably horrible and big for a single bomb, but media tends to portray them as like, death incarnate spreading out for hundreds or thousands of miles, which really isn't the case. The range of a bomb is unimaginably big for a bomb, but like, it's only really like 10 or 20 miles. If you set one off in a city ten or twenty miles would be the whole city and kill millions, but at some just random spot it's not as big a deal.

                "There were huge numbers of fallout-related deaths in Hiroshima and Nagasaki due in large part to the simple fact that those bombs detonated in an area with a high population density.  By comparison, the Nevada desert is empty for miles and miles and miles.  You can't kill people if they aren't around.\n\nThere certainly was fallout resulting from the Nevada tests, and there certainly was environmental impact.  (By fallout what is meant here is transmutation of elements in the ground by the bomb's radiation - that radiation takes innocuous elements in the ground and turns them into radioactive isotopes that stick around for a long time.)  You can't really avoid either one - all you can do is try to minimize the detrimental effects.  Above-ground detonations place the fallout into the prevailing winds, where it's carried away and deposited where it settles out.  Underground detonations place the fallout underground, where groundwater contamination is the bigger concern.  Neither of these options is much fun.\n\nDoing these tests in the desert is an effort to mitigate both of these... you have a vast and empty area, so most of the fallout from above-ground testing will settle in the empty desert, and you have a place where there's comparatively little groundwater moving around, which hopefully minimizes the transport of the underground fallout.\n\nTL;DR - there was plenty of significant environmental impact in Nevada.  The impact (and the degree to which people give a shit about it... people tend not to care much about empty desert) is just different, due to the minimizing effects of the desert environment.",

The findings helped convince U.S. President John F. Kennedy to sign the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty with the United Kingdom and Soviet Union, which ended the above-ground nuclear weapons testing that placed the greatest amounts of nuclear fallout into the atmosphere.\"\n_URL_0_",

Alex wrote me that in 1953, one test, codenamed \"Harry\" actually deposited quite a lot of fallout on St. George, to the point where residents were forced to stay inside for many hours, and prohibited from washing their cars until they became less radioactive.\n\nOver the years, says Alex, the U.S. government has paid some $813 million to more than 16,000 \"downwinders\" to compensate them for illnesses presumably connected to the bomb testing program. So it is clear that tests like these — often done to demonstrate the safety of nuclear weapons in the atmosphere — were not safe at all. \"\n\nThe most tragic one was probably the Bikini Atoll test where an island in the South Pacific was forcefully evacuated of their native residents (promised they could come back after) and then used for repeated nuclear tests of large bombs. The site was so radioactive afterwards that none of the residents could return, and they were relocated to another island where they dealt with starvation because the new island didn't have such a lush and successful reef around it.\n\n[_URL_1_](_URL_0_)\n\nWhy on earth the USA didn't just use the uninhabited and crappy island they moved the people to in the first place is a mystery to me.",

                " >   So how on earth is it a hard disk at all?\n\nThink of \"hard disk\" as \"TV\". A CRT and an LCD are both types of TV, even though they're completely different technologies. The names \"TV\" and \"hard disk\" refer to their function -- displaying video, and storing large quantities of files -- regardless of the underlying mechanisms.\n\nSATA, PATA, SCSI, etc refer to the way the hard disk communicates with the motherboard. The hard disk technology is exactly the same, the only thing that's different is the way the information is transmitted to the rest of the system. \n\nWe say \"a SATA hard disk\" when we mean \"a hard disk that uses a SATA connection to communicate with the motherboard.\" Do you know anything about TV equipment? If so, imagine that DVD players only have space on them for one single output. It would make sense to say \"this is a HDMI DVD player, that one's a composite DVD player\", and so on, right? Even though the DVD player would be the same machine, just with different output options on different models. That's what it's like with hard drives. ",
                "A hard drive has two major component subsystems:\n\n1. The platters, along with the mechanism that turns them, read/writes the data, and takes care of all the physical aspects of the device.\n2. The controller board, which *interfaces* between the physical/magnetic storage system in item 1 and your computer.\n\nSince different computers implement different communications standards (sometimes called bus architecture or interface), hard drives are made with different controller boards. For instance, Seagate may manufacture the same physical drive with both an ATA and SATA controller board. For the sake of simplicity, they'll be called an ATA and SATA *drive*, when in fact, there's no difference in the storage parts themselves, only the computers to which you can connect them.\n\nDoes that help?",
                "Other people have already explained the differences and what they mean, so let me give you a little context.  \n\nMany years ago,  printers were connected to computers using a parallel port.  Then technology advanced, clock speeds increased, and the parallel port went out and the serial port came in (the precursor to USB).  \n\nThe same shift happened here.  PATA stands for Parallel ATA, which was the standard until some years ago.  Then Serial ATA (or SATA) replaced PATA.  It had fewer data transfer pins (4 data pins, rather than PATA's 16 data and a few other special pins).  \n\nSCSI was the standard that had some extra functionality - it had the ability to send commands to hard drives over a special set of pins.  That means that the overall response time of the drive was faster, because it could transfer data over one set and commands over a different set.  \n\nSAS stands for Serially Attached SCSI.  It went through the same parallel-to-serial change that many other protocols went through.  It still has those special pins for sending commands that are separate from the data transfer pins.  SAS has fewer pins than SCSI, the same way that SATA has fewer pins than PATA and USB has fewer than parallel.  \n\nLet me know if that helps or if you have any other questions - I know a fair bit about hard drives.  \n\nA quick edit:  if it wasn't clear, you'd be hard-pressed to buy a PATA or SCSI hard drive now, and you wouldn't be able to find a motherboard with a PATA or SCSI connection either.  The same way you can't buy a computer with a parallel port.  ",
                "To add onto what others have said, the standards have differences. For example, SATA transmits data serially (bit by bit) where as PATA transmits it in parallel (multiple bits at a time). In this case, the former is the newer standard that is replacing the latter, which is older.\n\nAt its core, though, these are strictly computer bus interfaces that carry data between devices. The core devices themselves - be they a hard drive or a DVD ROM - are not inherently SATA/PATA/etc. That is determined by their bus interface."

                "The Crusaders, despite often being depicted as this sort of pan-European initiative, were frequently fractious and prone to prioritizing petty politics over working together. The knightly orders were no different. \n\nOne particular instance of this was the Siege of Ascalon in 1153. Ascalon, which is perhaps best described as the Egyptian counterpart to Krak des Chevaliers, proved a frequent thorn in the side of the Crusaders. And just as the \"Saracens\" would eventually decide to strike at Krak des Chevaliers, the Crusaders eventually decided they were tired of the incessant raids from Ascalon and they would just take the damned thing and be done with it. \n\nWhich, of course, is easier said than done. As described by Sir Steven Runciman, \"Ascalon was a tremendous fortress, spreading from the sea in a great semicircle.\" This was a problem as the Crusaders didn't have naval superiority. The Egyptians were able to sail a fleet into the fortress in June (the siege having begun in February) without the Christian fleet even attempting to stop them. The inability to close off the city meant that it was going to be nigh impossible to starve it out. The risk of a relief force arriving meant that a multiple year siege was a non-option. And that left the Crusaders with only one choice: take the city by storm.\n\nAscalon, however, had some pretty legitimate fortifications. Perhaps not *quite* as impressive as Tyre, where troops from Damascus were able to force the Crusaders to retreat before they reduced Tyre's defenses to a state that made it vulnerable to escalade, but they were well-maintained and would take several months of concerted effort to break. \n\nAt this point in the siege a particularly bizarre sequence of events unfold: the Crusaders had invested most of their resources in an enormous siege tower (perhaps remembering how successful a pair of huge towers proved to be at Tyre?). The defenders managed to conduct a successful sortie and burn the thing down. \n\nAt some point in the night, presumably after the foundations had been weakened by the firing, wind *blew the tower over*, whereupon it crashed into Ascalon's walls. From there, the intense heat of the fire cracked and undermined the walls and ramparts. By the time the next day rolled around, the wall had a breach. The Templars, perhaps believing that this was God's will (how else would they have explained a siege engine, lost on their stretch of wall, opening a breach?), decided that the honor of the attack should go them and them alone. They attacked and they failed spectacularly. \n\nAt this point the Christian forces were largely demoralized. Their great siege engine was burned, the Templars had lost dozens of their finest knights, and the breach was, apparently, unassailable. As the Crusader army wavered, it was the Hospitallers who argued that another effort should be made. This instance of the Hospitallers agreeing with the Templars was apparently so surprising that it swayed the barons and lords that were on the fence, another effort was made, and Ascalon fell. The treatment of the historical records of this event suggests that it was *extremely* unusual for the rival orders to agree on much of anything, which made the Hospitaller argument all the more poignant. \n\nThe Teutonic Knights are a bit more... odd. They didn't come into existence until around the time of the above siege (their roots start about a decade prior). For their first fifty years or so, they were simply a branch of the Hospitallers. The Hospitallers and Templars tended to boast an unusually high percentage of \"Franks,\" so Pope Celestine II decided there should be a German organization of some sort, which he originally flagged as a priory under the Hospitallers. Over time, this eventually evolved into a full-blown military order. But the Teutonic Knights showed up relatively late; their first holding of note wasn't until 1229, shortly after the recapture of Jerusalem, that they'd have a castle worthy of the term. But Jerusalem fell (again) in the 1240's, with this Teutonic castle meeting a similar fate a few decades later. And unlike the 1187 siege by Saladin, there would be no subsequent crusader relief (not that the complete disaster that was the Fourth Crusade helped). The Teutonic Knights are best known for their role in the Northern Crusades and subsequent wars with (then-Christian) Lithuania, not their relatively brief stint in Outremer. \n\nAs for actual battles between the Templars and Hospitallers? I'm not aware of any. They certainly spent a great deal of time and energy trying to outmaneuver or one-up one another (I suspect that trying to out-do the Templars was a contributing factor in the enormous expenses incurred in building Krak des Chevaliers), but I don't believe they ever fought one another in earnest. There were always Muslim armies to fight; fighting fellow Christians was a luxury the perpetually outnumbered knights of Outremer didn't have.  ",
                "The military orders certainly did fight and compete with each other. Ideally, the Orders were supposed to work together as they served the same master and had the same goals. The various military orders of the Crusades were all subordinate to the Pope and fighting to preserve the Crusader States. In practice however, the orders became powerful landlords and vassals, leading to them being entangled in politics and personal quarrels sometimes bringing them into conflict with each other.\n\nSometimes legal disputes could cause conflict between the orders. There was a long-running one between the Hospitallers and Teutonic Knights. The Hospitallers mistakenly believed that the Teutonic Order was based off a German hospital in Jerusalem, one which the Hospitallers were entitled to control. The Teutonic Knights were actually founded as a German hospital in Acre. Because of this error, the Hospitallers said that they should be placed in charge of the Teutonic Order. Beginning in 1190, this dispute did not end until 1231, when the Hospitallers asked the Teutonic Knights to act as negotiators for them in another legal case in Italy. However, after this date relations were generally cordial. The two orders acted on each others' behalf and guarded each others' holdings. They also fought on the same side against the Templars in the civil war of the 1240s. These property disputes could lead to open conflict, such as in 1197 when the Templars and Hospitallers fought over their rights to an estate in Tripoli. \n\nIn rarer cases, the military orders' secondary role as secular landlords could draw them into civil wars. In 1228 the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II arrived in the Holy Land. He claimed to be the king of the Kingdom of Jerusalem by the right of his wife, Isabella II of Jerusalem, who died that year. However, the nobility of the Kingdom had instead proclaimed that Frederick and Isabella's young son, Conrad II, would be king. After a short campaign and a series of negotiations, Frederick secured the handover of Jerusalem to Christian control but also antagonised the nobles of the Kingdom, provoking a civil war. The nobles recognised Frederick's rights as regent for his son, but not his right to be king himself. Frederick soon returned home, leaving some Italian supporters to represent his interests in the East. \n\nIntermittent conflicts bubbled away over the following years. In 1241 the Templars attacked the properties of the Hospitallers and Teutonic Knights in Acre because these orders had supported a treaty with Egypt, one that the Templars rejected. War broke out in 1242. Conrad II, then living in Europe, wrote to the people of his kingdom and said that he was now of age and so he had appointed an Italian, Richard Filangieri, to be his regent. This angered the nobility as they believed that the regent needed to be a relative of Conrad's from within the Crusader States, Alice of Champagne. The powerful Ibelin family backed her claims. In addition to this, the Ibelins and Templars supported making peace with Damascus and going to war with Egypt, whilst Frederick's imperial supporters and the Hospitallers  wanted peace with Egypt and war with Damascus. With the Templars, church, and nobles of the Crusader States led by the Ibelins fighting for Conrad, and Filangieri, Hospitallers and Teutonic Knights fighting for Frederick.\n\nFilangieri arrived in the Holy Land in early 1242 and stayed with the Hospitallers in Acre. The Order's stronghold was soon besieged by Ibelin, the Templars, and his supporters, forcing Filangieri to flee abroad. The Ibelins continued to fight the imperial faction, driving them out from their last stronghold of Tyre in 1243. The Crusader States then went to war with Egypt, were defeated, and lost control of Jerusalem.\n\nAnother war broke out between the Temple and Hospital in 1256, ending in 1258. This was triggered by a property dispute between the Genoese and Venetian communes in the Holy Land. The Hospitallers backed Genoa, the Templars Venice. Venice won, though it there's no evidence to show that the two orders directly fought each other this time.\n\nThe military orders sometimes even fought within themselves. One of the early modern grandmasters of the Hospitallers tried to enact a series of moral reforms, expelling prostitutes and the brethren's girlfriends into the countryside of Malta. In response, the brethren overthrew the grandmaster.\n\nThe smaller military orders like the Order of St Lazarus (the Leper Knights) and the English Knights of St Thomas of Acre don't seem to have been involved in these conflicts as heavily, probably because they were minor lords compared to the Temple, Hospital, and Teutonic Knights. In addition to fighting each other in the East, in Europe the military orders often fought other Christians. The orders constantly had to balance their role as ecclesiastics and as secular landlords, often failing to avoid civil conflicts. John Langstrother, the Hospitaller Prior of England, was executed in 1471 in the Wars of the Roses for backing Henry VI against Edward IV. The Scottish master of the Temple fought and died for Edward I against William Wallace at Falkirk in 1298.\n\nSources:\n\nHelen Nicholson, The Knights Hospitaller (Woodbridge, 2001).\n\nNicholas Morton, The Teutonic Knights in the Holy Land, 1190-1291 (Woodbridge, 2009).\n\nDesmond Seward, The Monks of War (London, 1972)."

                "The first firearm used was called the [Arquebus](_URL_0_). It was rather unreliable. Inaccurate, difficult to load and unable to even pierce the heavy armor of the day. Soldiers began to be armed with the weapon during the Italian Wars of the 16th century. I believe I learned that its first use in combat was in 1525 by the Spanish. \n\nSoldiers would be taken aback by the loud bang produced by the arquebus. Imagine the loudest thing you've heard in life being something heavy falling, tons of people yelling or a pitched battle. Suddenly you are confronted by a loud bang and a smokescreen. The weapons main use was for shock and awe tactics. Plumes of smoke were created by the weapon, and when a group of them were fired at the same time the smokescreen effect could be used tactically to move troops in cover. \n\nDespite the relative weakness of the weapon, the arquebus was an effective tool of war that could be used to shock and surprise enemies. I was going through my Renaissance textbooks trying to find a primary source discussing the arquebus but was unable to find one. I'll update if I come across a passage.",
                "As a follow up does anyone know how much extra damage would have been done had a ball hit someone wearing mail?",
                " > then later have seen a bullet kill the guy standing next to him in the blink of an eye.\n\nWell, not quite.  As the top post right now mentioned, early firearms were not at all as effective as the ones we have today.  There were not very many instant-kills with early firearms, and even after hundreds of years of their use they were still rather crude implements.  If you look at the number killed versus wounded in battles during the US Civil War, you'll note there were relatively few who died in battle, even though everyone was using rifles (which were *far* more accurate than early firearms) - [here](_URL_0_), for example, are the counts for the Siege of Vicksburg.  Many more died after the battle due to infections, or by the propagation of various diseases in the ranks.  So even in a time where firearms were so crucial to war, where nearly every part of battle focused entirely on using firearms (only officers carried swords, bayonet combat was a last resort), and where there were several innovations in firearms to make them even more deadly (rifling, gatling guns, various artillery), there still were relatively few deaths from gunshots.\n\nI imagine there are enough soldiers who were killed in the blink of an eye by early firearms, but it's much more likely that someone would get shot once or a few times, be incapacitated, and end up dying of an infection like sepsis or something.",
                "Am I allowed to twist OP's question a little?\n\nAre there any records of Native American (or perhaps other natives in isolated areas) reactions to gunpowder? It seems interesting since the opposing side would be so used to it, and the natives would have no idea what it is. ",
                "I remember reading a French medieval diatribe against the use of canons, that indiscriminately kill civilians, that goes through roofs to kill unsuspecting sleepers...\n\nIt was striking that by just replacing a few words you would have a text against nuclear weapons.",
                "Perhaps slightly off-topic, but I understand that the Chinese used rockets in battle in around the 13th century, and they used gunpowder to make nasty-sounding  grenade-type-things. \n\nI don't know their effects on the opposing army the first time they were used, but I would imagine 'shock and awe'. . . ",
                "In response to your first question, you need to realize that the development of firearms was more evolutionary than revolutionary. Generations of firearms were developed and refined over centuries, resulting in increasingly effective weapons. Not to say that there weren't a few big jumps in effectiveness produced by innovations, but guns didn't just explode onto the scene out of nowhere.\n\nAs to your second question, it depends on what you mean by battle. We see firearms being used in sieges almost immediately after their introduction in Europe, but not used on the field due to a combination of low power, unreliability, and the fact that gunpowder would dissolve into its constituent elements when treated to too much shaking.\n\nHigher quality powder (closer to the ideal mixture of saltpeter, charcoal, and sulphur), the arquebus with a matchlock firing mechanism, and granulated powder solved each of these problems respectively, and led to the first use of firearms in pitched battles in a real way from 1410 - although it wasn't until the mid-15th century that we saw the rise of tactics that used firearms effectively.\n\nHowever, the sense I get of your question is that you're really asking about what *effect* firearms had on Medieval warfare. I asked the same question a few months back in this subreddit, and did some research to find the answer. Arquebus specifically were (among other things) a counter to enemy pike formations and other forms of heavy infantry, sending volleys into the enemy formations as they approached to not only kill and terrify them, but destroy their cohesion before the two sides clashed. The Spanish Tercio, although a bit further in the future, is based on this principle.\n\nThis isn't terribly different from what previous ranged weapons did, but arquebus had *far* better armor penetration than bows. As the cost of plate armor dropped, and the front ranks (and more) of pikemen began to wear partial plate armor, the ability of bows to consistently kill them began to fail. Arquebus proved able to defeat munitions plate semi-consistently at ranges of 50 feet or less, which is were the ranges they ended up being used.\n\nNote that this is a huge generalization, as talking about \"firearms\" is like talking about \"polearms\" or \"bows\" - you're sweeping a whole lot of different weapons with different functions under one giant category. Firearms of the period included not only the shoulder-fired arquebus, whose function I've described, but also the powerful, clumsy musket, the sharpshooter's rifle, and various forms of light artillery that straddled the line between gun and cannon.\n\nIf you're interested in this, I can recommend some good reads on the subject. I'm an amateur myself, so you can be sure it won't be too heavy. ;)"

A customer collected so many stamps and it could be traded in for something for value through the company's store or catalog.\n\nBut to print the stamps cost money, so to cover that cost, retailers just raised the prices on the goods and passed it on to the consumers.\n\nRegulation from states required that the stamps be worth a certain *face value* so that if a customer wanted, it could retrieve cash instead of goods.  Retailers worked around that by giving the stamps a value of 1/10th or 1/100th of a penny.\n\nEventually coupons became more popular to entice customers but the regulations considered coupons as the same as stamps, so that's why there's a *face value* for coupons.\n\nEDIT: Clarification",
                "Back in the day, there was something called *trading stamps*.  For every dime you spent at the store, you got a stamp you could put into a booklet.  Once you acquired enough stamps, you could order items out of catalog.  The promotion was very popular with most shoppers...in the 1960's, S & H Green Stamps printed more stamps than the post office did.  The recession of the 1970s let to many stores cutting they stamp program to offer lower prices, leading to the eventual end of the stamps in the 1980s.\n\nHowever, these stamps weren't free, not to the stores.  They had to buy them, and then pass their cost on to the customer.  Customers who did not want to bother with stamps complained about being forced to pay for them, and some states passed laws requiring stamps to have a face value.  Stamp makers responding by assigning the lowest legally valid price, 1/100 of a cent.\n\nThe same laws that governed stamps could be construed to apply to other coupons, so the include the 1/100 of a cent fine print as a precaution.  They are not a currency, just a value you could redeem the coupon for from the organization that issued them.",
                "It started with trading stamps. Stores would give customers stamp for every 10 cents sold for example, and then they could use those stamps to buy other products. 100 stamps for a toaster or something. Since no store is going to just give away something for nothing, people quickly realized the stores were jacking up the prices on items to make up for the \"free\" stuff the stamps were buying. Essentially a 20 toaster was being bought with the equivalent of 40 dollars worth of stamps. To prevent stores from ripping people off, they enacted laws that stated stores had to put an actual cash value on the stamps. Naturally they simply gave them ridiculously low values. \n\nWhat do those stamps have to do with coupons? Some states consider stamps and coupons the same thing legally, so coupons need to have an actual cash value printed on them. Only a few states have that requirement, but most coupons are national so it's easier to just print them all with that value.",
                "Not an explanation, but an amusing anecdote: I've been in retail a long time. Occasionally I get a customer who wants to trade their coupon for its cash value (like, they have a coupon for $10 off and want to exchange it for $10 cash). My response is always \"I'd be more than happy to, just bring in 99 more because I can't get centipennies.\" They're always extremely confused until I show them the cash value printed on the coupon.

                "From Higginbotham's (2019) *Midnight in Chernobyl, the Untold Story of the World's Greatest Disaster* (emphasis mine)\n\n > The recollections of others present at the time would be quite different. According to Toptunov, Dyatlov not only witnessed the power fall but also—enraged—told him to withdraw more control rods from the reactor to increase power. Toptunov knew that to do so could certainly increase reactivity but would also leave the core in a dangerously unmanageable state. So Toptunov refused to obey Dyatlov’s command.  \n >   \n > “I’m not going to raise the power!” he said.  \n >   \n > **But now Dyatlov threatened the young operator: if he didn’t follow orders, the deputy chief engineer would simply find another operator who would.** The head of the previous shift, Yuri Tregub—who had stayed behind to watch the test—was well qualified to operate the board and right there at his elbow. And Toptunov knew that such insubordination could mean that his career at one of the most prestigious facilities in the Soviet nuclear industry—and his comfortable life in Pripyat—would be over as soon as it had started.  \n >   \n > Meanwhile, the reactor continued to fill with poisonous xenon 135, falling deeper and more inextricably into the well of negative reactivity. Finally, six long minutes after the fall in power had begun, Toptunov, terrified of losing his job, gave in to Dyatlov’s demands. The deputy chief engineer withdrew from the console, mopping sweat from his brow, and returned to his position in the center of the room.\n\n & #x200B;\n\nIn his end notes Higginbotham writes that he is quoting from Medvedev's (1991) *The Truth About Chernobyl.* Medvedev was a Deputy Chief Engineer at Chernobyl and conducting extensive first hand interviews. Higginbotham writes \"Medvedev writes that Toptunov would recount his thoughts \\[less than 24 hours later\\] while in the medieval center in Pripyat. He also claims \"this view is expanded on by Shcherbak's interviews with Kazachkov and Uskov in Chernobyl 366-69 and 370-74\" but I don't have access to those.\n\nIn *The Truth About Chernobyl* Medvedev writes (p54-55)\n\n > The situation in the room housing the main control panel of No. 4 reactor unit was one of high drama. With uncharacteristic energy Dyatlov ran around the operators' control panels, spewing forth a torrent of curses and foul language. His normally hoarse, quiet voice now took on an angry, steely tone. \"You goddam idiots, you haven't a clue! You've screwed everything up, you boobs! You're ruining the experiment! I can't believe what a bunch of assholes you are!\"  \n >   \n > His rage was understandable. The reactor was being poisoned by decay products. There were two options: increasing the power immediately, or waiting twenty-four hours for the poisons to dissipate. He should have waited. Dyatlov, you overlooked the fact that the core was becoming poisoned faster than you had thought. Stop now and, and mankind might be spared the Chernobyl disaster!  \n >   \n > But he was unwilling to stop. Still cursing, he dashed frantically around the control room, thus wasting valuable minutes. He ordered an immediate increase in the power of the reactor. Dyatlov continued to rant and rave.\n\n & #x200B;\n\n > Therefore Toptunov made the only correct decision.  \n >   \n > \"I'm not going to raise the power!\" he said firmly. Akimov supported him. Both men explained their apprehensions to Dyatlov.  \n >   \n > \"You lying idiot!\" Dyatlov turned on Toptunov, shouting. \"If it falls from 80%, the rules allow you to increase power after twenty-four hours, but you fell from 50%! The rules don't say you can't do that. If you don't increase the power, Tregub will.\"  \n >   \n > This was psychological warfare (Yuri Tregub was the shift foreman who had been relieved by Akimov and was still present, intending to witness the tests). Admittedly there was no way of knowing whether he would have agreed to increase the power level. Dyatlov, however, had guessed right: Toptunov, intimidated by his boss's shouting, acted against his own professional instinct. He was an inexperienced man, of course, of only twenty-six years old. He must have been calculating the odds: \"The operational reactivity reserve is twenty-eight rods. In order to offset the poisoning, we're going to have to remove five to seven rods from the reserve group. I might cause a power surge, but if I don't do what I'm told, I'll be fired.\" (These remarks were made by Toptunov in the Pripyat medical center before he was sent to Moscow).\n\n & #x200B;\n\nSerhii Plokhy in *Chernobyl, The History of A Nuclear Tragedy* (2018) quotes Razim Davaletbaev, deputy chief of the turbine unit who was in the control room on the right (from a Russian text published in 1995)  regarding Dyatlov's conduct earlier on the night....\n\n > Immediately upon the start of the shift, Diatlov began demanding that the program continue to be carried out. When Akimov sat down to study the program, Diatlov began reproaching him for working too slowly and failing to pay attention to the complexity of the situation that had arisen in the unit. Diatlov shouted at Akimov to get up and started insisting that he hurry up.\n\n & #x200B;\n\nAnd quotes Trehub/Tregub on Dyatlov's managerial style in general (from Shcherbak's \\*(\\*1991) *Chernobyl* again:\n\n > “He stopped off at Unit 3 on his way and evidently found something wrong with regard to discipline. He dressed them down,” remembered Trehub. That was typical of Diatlov. “He punished personnel severely for mistakes and disobedience, bellowing at them and fraying nerves,” recalled another colleague\n\n & #x200B;\n\nAs Rumbuck says in this thread we'll never actually know for sure, because it appears that the regime's response was to lay the blame on this one man rather than structural problems with the plant resign or the nuclear programme as a whole. But it would seem there is enough material floating around in the historical record to warrant saying he's was a belligerent guy not at all above bullying subordinates and it seems plausible, stressed as he was about getting the test done, that he would have threatened Toptunov with replacing him if he didn't do as ordered. Worth noting, in passing, that Toptunov actually was replaced as the events continued:\n\n > With Akimov’s assistance, Toptunov switched off the automatic system controlling the rods and began withdrawing them manually to breathe life back into the dying reactor. Trehub was also there to help. “Why are you withdrawing \\[the control rods\\] inconsistently? This is where you should be withdrawing,” he told Toptunov, who was initially taking them out of some sectors of the reactor but not from others. **Trehub eventually replaced Toptunov at his work station and brought the power level up to keep the reactor going.**\n\n(from Plokhy (2018), quoting Tregub's remarks in interview with Shcherbak) (my emphasis)."

In mice, tears serve as a chemosignal. We therefore hypothesized that human tears may similarly serve a chemosignaling function. We found that merely sniffing negative-emotion–related odorless tears obtained from women donors induced reductions in sexual appeal attributed by men to pictures of women’s faces. Moreover, after sniffing such tears, men experienced reduced self-rated sexual arousal, reduced physiological measures of arousal, and reduced levels of testosterone. Finally, functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed that sniffing women’s tears selectively reduced activity in brain substrates of sexual arousal in men.\n\nAdult signals caused by physical pain probably do include crying (in some cases), but adults might be less inclined to signal need unless it was really necessary."

                "First, your premise is not really correct. In covalently or H-bond bound compounds, you cannot really talk about individual atoms anymore as neighboring atoms share electrons. \n\nSecond, and more importantly, light is not arbitrarily small. Typically,  we can expect a wave packet to be at least as large as its wavelength, and in many cases much larger. Visible light, for example, has a wavelength of approximately 300-800 nm, which is much larger than a water molecule (about 0.1 nm), giving ample opportunity for interaction.\n\nWhy does a wave [diffract](_URL_0_) rather than going through the \"open space\"? [Huygens' principle](_URL_1_) states that each point of the wave front can be treated as the source of a new (spherical) wave. As for why that principle holds (one could also say, why waves propagate and display interference), I honestly cannot provide a satisfying answer. ",

Similarly, while you may be able to shoot a bullet through a single hedgerow of trees, you would have a very difficult time firing a bullet through the Amazon rainforest without hitting a tree (discounting the bullet falling to the ground eventually from gravity)",
                "First post here, and I am simplifying stuff, so I hope that won't be too bad:\n\nThe light interacts with the charged particles in a material (since it is an oscillation in the electromagnetic field). These particles can occupy different energy levels and by interacting with light they can pass to a different level.\n\nFor instance, an electron can absorb a photon by passing to an higher-energy level. Later, the same electron will go back to its previous low-energy state, giving back the energy difference to their environment. The same kind of mechanism can occur for other phenomena, such as vibration of atoms inside a molecule.\n\nNote that the electrons are situated in a cloud around the atomic nuclei (and are usually quite \"de-localized\"). It is likely that a photon will encounter some electron (and interact with it) even through a relatively thin layer of material.\n\nNevertheless it is possible that the light of a particular colour (wavelength) can't interact with some material: this happens when the energy a photon can give is not enough to create an energy level transition. In this case, the photons travel through the material cloud undisturbed. A common example of this behaviour is water (which is transparent for visible light, but not to microwaves and far-infrared).\n\nA category of materials that has a somewhat opposite behaviour are metals: their energy levels are continuous, so they can adsorb light in a very big wavelength spectrum. This is due to the fact that electrons can move freely inside them and can thus react promptly to the light (which can be seen as an oscillation of the electromagnetic field).\n\nTL;DR: Light doesn't pass through the gaps because electrons are spread around the molecules. Nevertheless, light can pass through some material if their energy level difference is too large compared to the photon energy."

                "In a very pedantic sense, no, for the simple reason that 'Uyghur' in its modern sense was a product of the early 20th century,^1 as the original Uyghur identity formed in the 8th century was largely subsumed by the Mongols, with the exception of their use of a Turkic rather than Mongolic language.^2 However, it is still a viable shorthand for the peoples who inhabited what is now Xinjiang from the end of the 8th century onwards, so for the purposes of this broad-sweep answer it will suffice. \n\nThe first substantial contact with the Turkic-speaking peoples now known as the Uyghurs came during the Tang Dynasty (618-907), though the earliest reference to them comes from the sixth century, where it is said that the 'high cart' people of Mongolia split into two tribal groups, the Ten Uyghur and the Nine Oghuz, the latter of whom migrated southwest to the foothills of the Tianshan Mountains, which run east-west through the middle of Xinjiang. Until 744 they were subjects of the eastern Göktürk Khaganate, but with support from the Tang formed a confederation with two other tribes and overthrew the Göktürks, before turning on their allies and forming an Uyhgur-led steppe empire. The Uyghurs at this time were generally on good terms with the Tang, and in 758 the Tang emperor Suzong married one of his daughters to the Uyghur khagan in thanks for providing troops to suppress the revolt of Roxshan (commonly Sinicised as An Lushan). In fighting An Lushan, the Tang had withdrawn their military colonies from the Tarim Basin, leaving the Tocharian oasis cities open for exploitation by both the Uyghurs and the Tibetans. In conjunction with this, unfavourable trade relations with the Uyghurs led the Tang to turn on their old allies. A combination of wars with the Tibetans, pressure from the Tang and in large part internal dissension, sparked in part by the khagan Bögü in 762 to Manichaeism, caused the disintegration of the Uyghur steppe empire by 847. By this stage relations had normalised again, and those who settled in Gansu generally remained on good terms with the Tang and Song, while in 857 the khagan of the Tarim branch was recognised with an imperial title from the Tang after expelling the remaining Tibetan presence from the eastern part of the basin.^2\n\nFrom here on out, the Uyghurs, concentrated in Tarim, were generally subjects of various Mongol empires, first the original Mongol khaganate from 1211 till 1271, then the Yuan Dynasty until 1295, the Chagatai Khanate until 1462, its various successors until the 1680s, and finally the Dzungar Khanate until 1758, when the region was conquered by the Qing. Qing policy was generally more pluralistic than was typical for a Chinese dynasty, not least due to the Qing core being Manchu rather than Han Chinese. As the Manchus had originated in the Liao River basin, with a uniquely syncretic blend of agrarian and pastoral economy and traditions, they were well aware of the mechanisms by which to operate both a steppe and a sedentary empire. As Peter Perdue puts it, the Qing blended 'bureaucratic, coercive and native' methods of control in administering their new conquests. In particular, military administration through the Banner system was the norm in the Northern March (centred on Ili) and the Eastern March (centred on Ürümqi), whereas the Southern March (covering the Tarim Basin) was mainly ruled by continuing the system of local *begs* that had been practiced by the Mongols, but with ranks made parallel to the Chinese bureaucracy up to the third-rank *hakim begs* responsible for individual oasis cities, and those regions incorporated into the western part of Gansu Province were gradually demilitarised and brought in line with conventional provincial administration. However, Uyghur communities in the Northern and Eastern Marches (known as Taranchis) had their own local *begs*, Banner and Green Standard Army garrisons were established alongside the Tarim oases, and the administrative oversight for all three marches was the responsibility of the viceroy of Shaanxi and Gansu.^3\n\nGoing from administrative to ethnic policy for a moment, Qing-era pluralism took a very different form from the hierarchical paradigm envisioned by John K. Fairbank in the mid-late 20th century. Instead of a concentric view of ethnicity in which individual peoples had their own relative distance from a core Chinese-ness, each cultural group under the Qing had its own particular relationship to the emperor. As an example, Han merchants tended to receive a blind eye when perpetrating abuses against Uyghurs during times of military crisis, which ubder the Fairbank model might place the Uyghurs below the Han in the hierarchy. Yet Uyghurs were not subject to the infamous queue edict which stipulated death for any Han Chinese man found not to have shaved his forehead and tied his hair back in the Manchu queue. Apologies for somewhat suddenly bringing in old historiography here, but the point is that the Qing, whom I cannot stress enough were Manchu (though what that meant certainly did change over time) and thus used to heading a distinctly multicultural empire (indeed, the core of Manchu rule, the Eight Banners, were around 20% Mongol and 20% Han Chinese)^4, were keen to maintain the image of a live-and-let live, multicultural administration in the Uyghur-dominated regions of Xinjiang.^1\n\nYou have by now probably noticed a few weasel-words. Well, the reason for that is simple, which is that the ideal of Qing policy repeatedly came up against the unfortunate reality of rule over Xinjiang, which was that the co-opting of Uyghur elites was simply not sufficient to maintain control over the ordinary Uyghur population. The Uyghur were predominantly Naqshbandiyya Sufis, split between the 'New Teaching' Afaqiyya and 'Old Teaching' Ishaqiyya branches, and internecine strife occasionally flared up between the two sides, which would on occasion escalate into anti-Qing revolt. In particular, in 1826 Jāhangīr Khoja, head of the Afaqiyya branch, marched out from the neighbouring Khanate of Kokand and rallied his followers in the western Tarim cities against the Qing, briefly wresting control of most of the Southern March until his capture by Han Chinese general Yang Fang two years later. While this briefly bolstered the relative position of the Ishaqiyya, who seized on their having remained pro-Qing as a means of displacing Afaqiyya *begs*, an invasion by the Sunni Khanate of Kokand in 1830 (closely tied with the Afaqiyya) displayed the need for the Qing to have a more substantial non-Muslim population in the Tarim region if it was to retain its hold. During the invasion, Han and Chinese merchant communities had formed militias that proved vital in holding the Banner citadels and preventing their capture by the Kokandis, and so commercial penetration into the region by Han and Hui Chinese increased.^1 However, just as the Tang lost their ability to hold Tarim due to An Lushan's revolt, the Taiping War in the 1850s cut Xinjiang from its vital subsidies of silver and grain for the army and cloth, silk and tea for trade, causing a minor exodus of merchants and leaving the garrisons quite literally starving, when Hui revolts in the Northern and Eastern Marches in 1864, followed rapidly by Sufi uprisings in Tarim, wrested the province out of Qing control entirely until 1878. By this stage Han nationalism in China had evolved away from the inward-focussed view of the Ming to a much more imperialistic one that included the territories added to the empire by the Qing – Manchuria, Mongolia, and Xinjiang – and Han elites now held a much more important stake in the military and civil administration, and so after Zuo Zongtang reconquered the region in 1878, the old compromise system with the Uyghur was soon overturned, and Xinjang became incorporated as its own province with a Han Chinese governor in 1884 (before 1864 the military administration was always headed by Manchus) and was brought in line with the ordinary Chinese administration.^5\n\nAs for the Hui, Qing policy was always somewhat uncertain. On the one hand, as a significant part of the Gansu and Shaanxi populations, Hui merchants were necessary to keep Xinjiang's administrative and military infrastructure supplied with essential goods, and they were a major part of the agricultural colonies of the Northern and Eastern Marches. However, Hui were also known for being particularly inclined towards integrating with the Uyghur population, often taking Uyghur wives and adopting the Uyghur language, and in some cases even violating the queue edict. Hui merchants also appear to have been particularly active in trying to circumvent Qing trade regulations, particularly in smuggling rhubarb to Kokand and jade to China proper, which certainly suggests a degree of Hui distance from the Qing, but whether this signifies more Hui resistance or Qing suspicion is probably a matter of interpretation.^1"

Water is scarce in this semi arid and arid areas more than the south west and that's the driving force. Living in America, I have to come to realize we are such big wasters of water. The large amounts that flow out as you, for example, wait for shower water to warm up, or flush a second time cause the poop didn't all go in the first flush, are astonishing. \nThe residents of these regions have learned to do so much with such little amounts of water. Dishes can be washed and then the same water used to water plants or feed animals. \n\n",

                "As someone who lives in one.\nCurrently with the availability of electricity and modern technology we can desalinate sea water and hence we effectively have an unlimited supply as long as we have the fuel to power the desalination plants. A modern addition to this is sewage treatment. In the old days however we dug wells in the ground and used that as a source of water both for human consumption and farming. Also we are brought up to appreciate that water is a scarce resource and treat it as such.",
                "The big problem with the droughts in California is that they have created an area with an artificially abundant source of water. People in California have been living for years as if the state were not largely very arid, pumping water in from the rest of the state to support agriculture, golf courses and general wastefulness by people in general. Now that the parts of the state that supply this water are not getting replenished, reservoirs and ground water sources are quickly drying up as the need for all this water in areas that we've created continue to need water that just isn't there.\n\nIn desert societies, they existed before the technology existed to bring large amounts of water from elsewhere was invented. Their culture, architecture, and city planning has evolved without access to large amounts of water, so they are (generally) much more sustainable and realistic in regards to their water usage.",

                "Viewers of the original series in the 1960s likely wouldn’t have been bothered by the show’s post scarcity communism, because in the 1960s edition the idea of the Federation as a post scarcity communist society hadn’t been invented yet. \n\nThe original series isn’t exactly replete with references to money. But they’re common enough that no one would think the show is about a communist society. Just as a few examples: \n\nIn *The Trouble with Tribbles* Cyrano Jones is trader who among other things sells exotic curiosities like Tribbles, Spican Flame Gems, and Antarean Glow Water. And as a Starfleet officer Uhura has no problem coming up with ten credits to buy a Tribble. Nor does the Federation barkeep have problems with the idea of buying tribbles, he does object to Jones’ price however.\n\nIn *Arena* Kirk notices a “fortune” in diamonds on the planet. \n\nIn *Mudd’s Women* we have another trader, and con artist. Among Mudd’s prior federation convictions is currency counterfeiting. Much of the plot revolves around Kirk negotiating the purchase of dilithium from the local miners, Federation citizens. As Kirk says, “I am authorized to pay an appropriate price.” Kirk is then surprised when the miners want to barter rather than receive money.\n\nIn *The Apple* Kirk and Spock discuss the costs of creating an officer, with Federation investment into Spock’s training coming to twenty two thousand two hundred \\[Interrupted\\] (presumably credits). \n\nIn *The Doomsday Machine* Kirk tells Scotty he “earned his salary this week.” He tells the exact same thing to Chekhov in *Who Mourns for Adonis*. \n\nIt’s certainly possible that Gene Roddenberry was already thinking of the Federation as a communist society, but it wouldn’t have been clear to a casual viewer. Viewers would see a show where characters buy and attempt to buy various goods. Where multiple merchants exist. Where the characters refer to money, currency, fortunes, salaries, and investments. \n\nThe earliest references to the communistic nature of the Federation (as far as I can find) is in the 1986 movie *Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home* and the 1988 Next Gen first  season episodes *The Last Outpost* and *The Neutral Zone*. Even the Animated Series had references to what appears to be a capitalistic economy/society."

                "We can start out by thinking about the 1941 movie *Tall, Dark, and Handsome*. There are a couple possibilities - the film was popular enough to make the phrase into a cliche, or it was a cliche already and the title was playing off of it. While the film seems to have been reasonably popular, this seems to be a case of the latter. \n\nThe Oxford English Dictionary has citations of the phrase going back to 1906, but their list isn't exhaustive, and you can find the phrase in sources like the New York Times, the LA Times, and the Washington Post in the 19th century, back to the 1860s ([here's a wedding announcement from 1888](_URL_0_) in the NY Times that uses the phrase).\n\nInterestingly, that Times citation is describing a woman, even though the cliche today is men-oriented (the OED's listing of a phrase even says \"denoting a type of attractive man\"), and other usages seem to suggest it was gender-neutral early on. The point where it became a cliche, and where it became gendered, appears to be with Mae West's usage of it to describe Cary Grant in the 1933 film *She Done Him Wrong* - a quote giving this explanation is specifically highlighted in the OED's listing. The movie was a hit (it also had Mae West's line \"Why don't you come up some time and see me?\" which made AFI's 100 Years, 100 Movie Quotes list), so it's not unbelievable, and Brewer's Dictionary of Modern Phrase  &  Fable (John Ayto and Ian Crofton, 2006) dates its status as a stock phrase to the 1930s, so that lines up.\n\nAs to the meaning, \"tall\" and \"handsome\" seem pretty self-explanatory, but \"dark\" is ambiguous. The film *Tall, Dark, and Handsome* starred Cesar Romero, who had Cuban and Spanish parents, and the NY Times citation I link above is also describing a Cuban woman. The Washington Post [used it in 1900](_URL_1_) to describe a Spaniard, and [again in 1909](_URL_2_) to describe an Italian man. That suggests there may be some \"ethnic\" component to it. However, Cary Grant was described that way, and he was a British-born actor. He was indeed tall and handsome, but his \"darkness\" seems to just be his hair and eye color. Given that he seems to be the cliche-making use of the phrase, it would suggest that that's what people consider \"dark\" in using the phrase, though dark hair and eyes often correlate with Hispanic ancestry anyway."

                "There is always more to be said, and hopefully someone knowledgeable will stop by to say it. But, while you are standing by for fresh responses, it is worth pointing out that this question came up here a while ago and got some great answers in a thread led by u/ah003. You might like to review it while you're waiting:\n\n[During the era where Zeus was the dominant God, is there any documentation of someone being struck by lightning and surviving? How would that person be treated?](_URL_0_)",
                "Surviving a smiting was clearly significant. Lightning - like the livers of sacrificed animals, flights of birds, the utterances of the oracles, and so many other apparent signs and omens - manifested the will of the divine. But exactly what it meant was unclear. \n\nTypically - and especially if the smitten party was important enough to spin things to his advantage - surviving a lightning strike was understood as a good thing. That great self-mythologizer Mithridates VI claimed that he had twice been struck by lightning: \n\n\"whilst he was an infant a flash of lightning burnt his cradle, but did his body no harm, and only left a little mark on his forehead, which his hair covered when he was grown a boy; and after he came to be a man, another flash broke into his bed-chamber, and burnt the arrows in a quiver that was hanging under him\" (Plutarch, *Convivial Questions* 1.6.2)\n\nThe second story, at least, is plausible enough; and we are told that the king's diviners (working none too hard) interpreted the strike as a sign that \"archers and light-armed men should win him considerable victories in his wars.\" These stories (in combination with the king's habit of indulging in gargantuan drinking bouts) won Mithridates the nickname of Dionysus (the god Dionysus had been blasted from his mother's womb by a thunderbolt of Zeus).\n\nSeveral other passages suggest that lightning strikes were viewed as a sign of divine favor. According to some myths, Hercules had been translated to the heavens by a thunderbolt. Those whose tombs were struck by lightning, accordingly, were sometimes assumed to have achieved a sort of divine status. Plutarch reports that:\n\n\"when the remains \\[of the Spartan general Lycurgus\\] were brought home, his tomb was struck by lightning, and that this hardly happened to any other eminent man after him except Euripides...The lovers of Euripides therefore regard it as a great testimony in his favor that he alone experienced after death what had earlier befallen a man \\[Hercules\\] who was most holy and beloved of the gods.\" (*Lycurgus* 31.3)\n\nOn other occasions, a lightning strike was interpreted as a warning. As a character in one of Plutarch's dialogues remarks (apparently recalling an actual incident):\n\n\"I remember here in this town lightning broke into a house, and did a great many strange things. It let the wine out of a vessel, though the earthen vessel remained whole; and falling upon a man asleep, it neither hurt him nor blasted his clothes, but melted certain pieces of money that he had in his pocket, defacing them, and made them run into a lump. Upon this he went to a philosopher, a Pythagorean, then staying in the town, and asked the reason; the philosopher directed him to some expiatory rites, and advised him to consider seriously with himself, and go to prayers.\" (*Convivial Questions*, 4.2.3)\n\nThis philosopher, at least, seems to have assumed that Zeus was displeased. The idea - also mentioned by Plutarch - that the corpses of those killed by lightning never putrefy is also susceptible to multiple interpretations. Were they blessed, or cursed?",
                "I would like to approach this topic *slightly* from the side, and hope to make an interesting contribution. Two **caveats** right off the bat: 1) I'm coming at this as a *natural* historian who has worked extensively with indigenous peoples in N. and central America. I am a social-ecological systems science professor, but was once a professor of indigenous studies (and in particular how plants and ceremonies structure worldviews). 2) This question would make as much sense in /r/AskAnthropology as it would here, and you'd likely get some interesting takes on a *generalizable* version of your question (\"how did pre-enlightenment cultures interpret survival of natural misadventure?\").\n\n--------------\n\nFirst, /u/toldinstone makes a very important point below: that being struck by lightning could be viewed as either good *or* bad in classical Rome and Greece, depending on outcome and professional spin. I would suggest that the idea that being *struck* by lightning as a \"bad thing to happen\" to a person is actually a pretty modern (i.e., post-Enlightenment) take on misadventure. In Western thinking since the time of Descartes (and before), there is a formalized notion of the *unitary self* being the best state a human being can be in. Disability, disfigurement, or division is a sign of both *something wrong* and also divine misfavor. This likely has significant roots in pre-Enlightenment thinking in some places, but it has been expressed (and studied) *ad nauseum* in the last few hundred years. \n\nThe best exploration of this idea is, in my opinion, in Michel Foucault's first book, *Folie et Déraison: Histoire de la folie à l'âge classique*. The book is available in English as well, under the title *Madness and Civilization: A History of Insanity in the Age of Reason*, and makes the point that many medical conditions which were interpreted as making someone \"holy\" or \"sacred\" in pre-Enlightenment thinking became through objectification a reason for separation and dismissal in the 17th C (his \"The Great Confinement\"). In his reading of history and philosophy, someone who was \"mad\" in medieval times would be seen as an uncomfortable, distorted, but necessary mirror of normal society, while someone similarly mad post-Enlightenment would be considered mentally ill and put away in an institution to protect them (and more importantly society) from their influence.\n\nThere is a parallel in historical and anthropological studies of N. American indigenous societies which bears on your question. At its most general, *many* (but certainly not all) American Indian  &  First Nations (AI) peoples viewed/view sickness and difference (whether physical or mental) as a blessing rather than a curse. As a boon rather than as a punishment. For example, early European liaisons to (and observers of) Eastern Woodland cultures of N. America noted that healers/doctors/spiritual leaders were often crippled or \"mad,\" and that they believed that physical and mental infirmity was the price one paid to heal someone else. So, Henry Timberlake observed an old woman in Chilhowee in the mid 18th C. who became \"more and more crippled by rheumatism\" with every healing ceremony she conducted for the Cherokee of her community. The more bent and ugly she became, the more powerful she was considered to be, and she was the most revered person in the community. This is also well documented in the excellent *Cherokee Women: Gender and Culture Change, 1700-1835 (Indians of the Southeast)*, in which Theda Perdue also points out that transexuals, homosexuals, the physically maimed, and the mentally ill (or different) were generally considered sacred people that had duties to their communities but were held in great reverence.\n\nHow does this relate to being struck by lightning? Although I haven't seen any references from E. Woodland lit on lightning, it's an incredibly common topic (both historically and now) in Plains and Western US/Canada native culture. The *heyokha* of the Lakota Sioux were a sacred clown society chosen by thunder/lightning beings to be of service to their people. Sometimes this was through surviving a lightning strike, or sometimes this was through personal revelation (during a coming of age ceremony). It was generally held that the punishment for being a *bad* sacred clown was being killed by lightning strike. So, surviving lightning was to be chosen for special service as the \"mad mirror\" to normality, and the price for not doing one's service was to die by lightning. Personal accounts of this from the 19th C. are in *The Sixth Grandfather: Black Elk's Teachings Given to John G. Neihardt* (1985, ed. DeMallie) from University of Nebraska Press; there are more scholarly discussions in the book *Divine Play, Sacred Laughter, and Spiritual Understanding* (2005) from Palgrave Macmillan, particularly Laude's chapter 7 titled \"Thundering Clowns.\" \n\nI have some personal experience with this as well (more than 20 years ago). I was invited while doing field work to return the following year and participate in a community healing ceremony (a Sun Dance) in the 1990s hosted by Assiniboine people from the US reservations and Canadian reserves just across the Montana border. I met members of two different \"Clown Societies,\" one Assiniboine and the other Piikani (southern Blackfeet), who acted as \"marshalls\" for the ceremony. They dressed in crazy paint and costumes, lurched around the grounds (completely sober, mind you) confronting outsiders and miscreants, and generally acted like gadflys (in the service of allowing the doctors, dancers, and the afflicted to dance and pray unmolested by curious onlookers). They ran an anthropologist and his grad students from Toronto off, they picked up trash and gave people littering a terrible time, and they made sure people in the surrounding area weren't drinking. They didn't dance themselves (although many had in the past), and they didn't enter the arbor, but they did run sweats to cleanse dancers before the ceremony, for everyone after the ceremony, and for anyone else that needed a sweat.\n\nI spoke to the Piikani doctor who was the \"leader\" (or at least oldest) of the clowns from Blackfeet, and he showed me his torso (with typical \"lightning tree\" scars). He was struck in the Sweetgrass Hills as a 17 year old and was inducted into the Clown Society some fifty years before I met him. Everyone else in their society had either been struck or very narrowly avoided it. They considered it absolutely imperative that a lightning-struck person was blessed by a particular spirit and chosen to special service. Like the Lakota, they insist that those killed by lightning have offended the spirits or broken a vow, and that for a clown to disobey (including by drinking) would result in death by lightning strike for them and/or their families. Serious business, but a fun bunch.\n\n---------------------------------\n\nSo why all this tangential information about philosophy and AI peoples and lightning strikes and clowns? Because it contextualizes your question to one that makes more sense to me: how did cultures who believed in lightning gods/spirits think of humans being struck by lightning? Some people in some cultures are *honored and revered* for surviving a lightning strike and become, for lack of a better term, \"priests\" for a God or spirit/power. Being killed by lightning strike was punishment, but surviving was a sign of being chosen.\n\nWhy wouldn't that be a reasonable response for Romans, Greeks, or Germanic tribes as well?"

You may not know where your next meal is coming from or where you'll sleep tonight. You might not know where your brother, sister, mother or father is. Do you have a job anymore? Can you survive anymore?\n\nA disaster is not just the single moment when the roof is torn from your home. It lasts until you are again as secure as you were before the disaster.\n\n***\n\nRight now, Alaska ─ my home state ─ is in economic turmoil. With oil prices plunged, there's a multibillion-dollar deficit. The state's savings accounts will last, but not for more than two years at the outside. Thousands of people have lost their jobs, and thousands more will lose theirs. \n\nThis isn't a disaster like a hurricane or a tsunami, but it's a disaster nonetheless. \n\nIn this disaster, the state's governor has argued, the enemy isn't the deficit ─ it's the uncertainty it brings. As long as the deficit exists, people are uncertain about what will be done to fix it. Will they lose their jobs? Will they have to move? Can they truly risk buying a home, starting a new business, purchasing a new car?\n\nUncertainty creates stress, paralysis and fear. When the uncertainty is great enough, it can cause terror.\n\n***\n\nI mention this only to give you a doorway by which to experience what the mood must have been in Moscow in 1937. A previous commenter claimed that the Great Terror impact on an ordinary Soviet citizen was \"not very much.\" \n\nThat's probably the biggest error I've *ever* seen on /r/askhistorians that wasn't deliberate Holocaust denial.\n\n**The effects of the Great Terror ─ Robert Conquest coined that term, and it is appropriate ─ were felt at every level of Soviet society in a drastic and unforgettable way.** To quote Norman Naimark's *Stalin's Genocides*:\n\n > \"The term captures well the 'apocalyptic theater of horrors' of those two years in which every Soviet citizen, with the exception of the *vozhd* himself ─ Stalin ─ could potentially be arrested, tortured, exiled, or executed. The fear was palpable and, especially for those in any position of responsibility ─ the nomenklatura of the party, factory bosses, intellectuals, army generals, and newspaper editors ─ bags were packed in case the knock on the door came ...\"\n\nVarious professions endured particular attention. As Karl Schlögel writes in *Moscow 1937* (first published in German, but available in English since 2013), demographers, statisticians, geologists ─ even mountain climbers ─ earned special attention from the purge. These were not high-ranking officials, just ordinary people in the bureaucracy created by the Soviet system.\n\nIn the 1930s, that bureaucracy was booming as the Soviet Union embarked on one of the great modernization campaigns of human history. Victor Fischer, one of the last surviving creators of the Alaska Constitution, grew up in Moscow during the Great Purge. In his memoir, *To Russia with Love*, he recalls how he and school classmates had great fun playing around the city in the vast construction sites that dotted it. \n\nIn his book, Schlögel makes the case that the soaring Soviet expansion efforts inevitably ran into teething problems. Amid the excesses of the Great Terror, people assigned to these projects were executed as \"wreckers\" or \"saboteurs\" of the state. Take the Moscow-Volga canal, whose opening coincided with the arrest, prosecution and execution of its overseers, or the way problems with the swelling Soviet railway system led to a hunt for saboteurs that inevitably killed the innocent.\n\nThe Great Terror is typically divided into two sections, the one before August 1937 ─ which was focused on the party and government's elite ─ and the period after August 1937, where the executions spread.\n\nAs Montefiore writes in *Stalin: The Court of the Red Tsar*:\n\n > \"Here, on the contrary, death was sometimes random: the long-forgotten comment, the flirtation with an opposition, envy of another man's job, wife or house, vengeance or just plain coincidence brought the death and torture of entire families. This did not matter: \"Better too far than not far enough,\" Yezhov told his men as the original arrest quota ballooned to 767,397 arrests and 386,798 executions, families destroyed, children orphaned, under Order No. 00447.\"\n\nThe Terror grew and grew because the Stalinist system of denunciations combined with the Soviet love of quotas and overfulfilling them. Anyone who overfilled their quota, whether that quota was the manufacture of shoes or of executions, could expect rewards. Denunciations were an easy way to file grievances and cover your own skin. As Montefiore writes: \"Once the Terror was unleashed, denunciations worked like kerosene on a fire, keeping it flaring up. These denunciations were already a vital part of the Stalinist system: everyone was expected to denounce everyone else. In the Bolshevik universe, there were only two ways for mistakes to come to the notice of the leaders: accidents ─ and denunciations.\"\n\nAs /u/TenMinuteHistory points out, these denunciations (and the punishment for them) could be arbitrary. Again, the *uncertainty* is what made the Great Terror a disaster that affected far more people than were killed or imprisoned. The fear spread because *anyone* could be taken away in the middle of the night, with little cause. There was no rule of law, no regulated process for appeal and hearing. The Great Purge went through the motions of a trial, but if an execution was decided, it would come quickly. \n\nThe most common estimates claim that the Terror resulted in 1.5 million arrests and more than 700,000 executions. These were no small figures. [Going by the 1940 U.S. Census](_URL_0_), it would be as if every person in Pittsburgh was taken into a basement and shot. Every person in Los Angeles would be deported to camps throughout the Rocky Mountains or Alaska.\n\nThe Great Terror was not limited to a certain age, gender, economic class or geographic area. In 2000, Melanie Ilic published \"The Great Terror in Leningrad: A Quantitative Analysis\". In Leningrad, the victims of the Great Terror ranged from 19 to 78 years of age. Fewer than 4 percent were women. While most purge victims were ethnic Russians, minorities sometimes suffered disproportionately. Poles, for example, made up 16 percent of the purge's victims, even though they were less than 1 percent of the USSR's population nationally. Ethnic Germans were purged in large numbers due to fears of war with Nazi Germany.\n\nEven Americans were subject to the purge. In 2008, Tim Tzouliadis published *The Forsaken: An American Tragedy in Stalin's Russia*, which detailed the plight of the thousands of Americans who emigrated to the Soviet Union to the Great Depression. They came seeking jobs and security from economic uncertainty ─ the Soviet Union, locked out of global trade, was surging while the world faltered in the Depression ─ but within a few years, they found the Great Terror.\n\nFord Motor Company, in the midst of the Depression, made a deal with the Soviet Union to construct a huge factory complex in Gorky. Hundreds of Americans emigrated to the Soviet Union to work there. Many were devoted communists seeking \"true socialism.\" Instead, the Terror ate them.\n\nOn Oct. 7, 1937, *Pravda* published an article accusing the new factory of \"shameful\" work, Tzouliadis explains. \"Wreckers\" had ruined machinery with \"carelessness and insufficient care,\" which was the logical explanation for why the new plant could not match the production of the automobile works in Detroit. In describing what happened to one particular family, part of the nascent 1930s Soviet baseball circuit, Tzouliadis writes:\n\n > \"THROUGH THE COURSE of 1937 and 1938, Americans such as Victor Herman began to disappear, one after another. Many of the arrested were shot not long afterward, often with their fathers, who had brought them to the USSR. After their denunciation, the baseball players from Boston, Arthur Abolin and his younger brother, Carl, were both arrested and executed with their father, James Abolin, in 1938. Their mother died later, in a concentration camp. Only their younger sister, Lucy Abolin ─ the precocious drama student of the Anglo-American school ─ was left untouched.\"\n\nThese are the stories of the men, women and children who died. The Terror didn't just touch them: It touched every person who lived in the Soviet Union. This was a disaster of catastrophic proportions, but unlike a hurricane's winds or an earthquake's shaking, it did its damage as much with the uncertainty and terror left in the minds of its victims as it did with the bullets fired from a gun.\n"

                "Also think about it. The average MLB stadium capacity is around 45,000 or so and the NFL might be 70,000? Even then, there are 162 baseball games in a season over the 16 in a football season.You're going to have more home games than NFL season games. Sort of explains how they can afford this.",
                "The NFL and NBA have salary caps and if you go over you are heavily penalized. In baseball there is a luxury tax but that number is so high that most teams can't get close to it because the owners aren't huge spenders. Teams like the Yankees, Dodgers and Rangers usually get close to that number but all it does is force the owner to pay extra money to the league. Plus the injury risk of the NFL is so much higher than baseball and committing that much money can go wrong very quickly. \n\nEdit: I forgot that all the money baseball players get is guaranteed unlike the NFL where only part or in some cases none of the contract has guaranteed money. ",
                "The answer is actually a combination of all these factors... while the NFL as a whole may make more money, in their CBA the teams are a part of revenue sharing. merchandising, tv deals, etc. are generally done through the league... as a result no one team really makes that much more than any other.\n\nOn top of that, to create parity in the league, the NFL established a hard salary cap in the mid-90s. In 2014, the cap is around $135 million. Every NFL team has 53 men on each roster, and the combined salaries of all these players MUST fall under the cap. 53 players divided by 135 is approx $2.5 million. League minimum for young players is about $0.5 million. veteran (4 years) minimum is about $0.75 million. Many NFL players hover around and just above this amount in order to sign their big name players (QBs, LT, def Star) so for every big name player they sign for $10+ million a year, they need about 5-10 players to be paid under $2.5 million. This is generally why you don't see very many BIG contracts in the NFL\n\nThere are ways around this where they back load salary and signing bonus heavy (for big stars at least). On top of that, these contracts are not guaranteed, which is why you rarely see players make it to the end of their contracts in the NFL\n\nbaseball on the other hand is very team heavy instead of league heavy as far as revenue is concerned. Each individual teams has control over their merchandising and tv deal. Due to this, teams in large markets (NYC, LA, Chicago, Dallas, Boston, Philly, etc) get HUGE tv deals. and team that have history or large fan bases (Yankees, Tigers, Dodgers, etc) sell merchandise like crazy. On top of all that, MLB has no cap in place and no quick or direct way to ensure teams who play poorly get better.\n\nAs a result, there are about 5-7 teams that will always have more money to spend on players. Yankees, Dodgers, Angels, Tigers, and the Red Sox are regularly teams with top revenue stream and team salaries. In recent years, Rangers, Giants, Nationals, and the Phillies have become regular mainstays in the top 10 team salaries.\n\nTo get to the root of why baseball players get big contracts, you have to look that the salary structure for players in their first six years in the majors. this is a system where rookies get paid dirt cheap and in the first 3 years teams can fix those contracts. After that the player and team go through and arbitration period of about 3-4 years. Because of all this the team is able to manage players salaries to a reasonable amount. This can all be bypassed, however, if the team decides they want to buyout the player and sign them to a real first contract (see Mike Trout)\n\nNow depending on when the player's first year in the majors, they will first become a free agent some where around 26-30 years old. Now since there is no salary cap in baseball, nothing is prevention players, who are usually good players in their prime, from going after large contracts that those top 10 team will usually pay.\n\nSince you asked about Cabrera specifically, his contract is a result of being on a team that is in a large market, a historically good team, and current power in baseball. The first 4 years of his career he was an All-Star, hitting 25-35 home runs a year but made less than $1 million dollars. After a favorable arbitration and earning $7 in his last year on the Marlins, he was traded to the Tigers at the end of the 2007 season.\n\nThe Tigers bought out the rest of his deal and signed him to an 8-year deal and since he has won 2 MVPs and a triple crown in 2012 (which hadn't been done since 1967). Cabrera will turn 31 next month, which is still considered the prime of a baseball player's career. Detroit offloaded a huge contract this offseason and with Cabrera nearing the end of his current deal, the Tigers wanted to give him an extension. he is considered one of the best hitters in the game currently, so since the Tigers are one of those top teams that is in a bigger market, nothing is stopping them from paying Cabrera like he is the best player in the league.\n\nBottom line, the MLB CBA favors the players, the NFL CBA favors the league/owners.",

                "At some point in the mid-460s BC, the Athenians and their allies under the general Kimon annihilated a Persian fleet and army in a single day at the Eurymedon, crushing Persia's final attempt to take Greece by force. Despite its magnitude, this event is so poorly known that we're not even sure in which year it happened. Our most contemporary source, the historian Thucydides, says little more about it than what I just wrote here.\n\nHowever, the later historian Diodoros of Sicily obliges us with a more fleshed-out version of the story. In his account (11.60-61), the Athenians first fought and captured the Persian fleet. Kimon, hoping to overcome the enemy army by surprise, then ordered his men to dress up in full Persian gear and man the captured ships. He waited until nightfall, and then made for the beach where the Persian army was encamped. Recognising the approaching triremes, the enemy thought their own fleet was coming to land, received the Athenians as friends. The Athenians promptly attacked the camp, scattered the panicked Persians, and killed one of their commanders, a nephew of Xerxes himself.\n\nWe can't tell where Diodoros got this tale from, and the whole thing may be fanciful fiction - but at least it has Greeks dressing up in trousers and tiaras, so there's that.",

The majority of the people dwelled in poverty and were entirely dependant on those factories and the underpaid jobs there.

                "A bit late on this, but still:\n\nOn February 7, 1910, [a group of foreign dignitaries](_URL_0_) -- Abyssinian princes conducting an extended tour of England -- arrived at the docks at Weymouth.  They had arrived with the intention of inspecting HMS *Dreadnought*, the most formidable warship on earth, and to pay their respects to her crew and commander.  Her captain at the time was Herbert Richmond, a prickly and unpopular character in the Navy, but one who could be counted on to observe the proper niceties in a situation such as this.\n\nTheir arrival was not unexpected -- Herbert Cholmondeley, a clerk of the Foreign Office, had telegrammed in advance to warn the *Dreadnought* and her crew of the dignitaries' imminent arrival.  Their Abyssinian provenance threw everyone off kilter; protocol demanded an honour guard and a formal reception in a case such as this, but the notice of their arrival had been so short that no Abyssinian flag could be acquired.  It was consequently decided (somewhat bafflingly) that the flag of Zanzibar would be flown instead, and the Zanzibar national anthem played.  The visiting princes seemed touched by the gesture, much to the crew's relief.\n\nThe inspection duly proceeded.  With the aid of an interpreter (the princes spoke no English), the visiting party made clear its complete satisfaction with the *Dreadnought* and her crew.  They were very impressed with the ship, very grateful for the warmth of their reception, very pleased to be able to report back home that all was well with the Royal Navy, etc.  Captain Richmond was suitably chuffed, and bid them a happy farewell as they departed.\n\nThe problem with all of this is that there were no Abyssinian princes.  Herbert Cholomondeley did not exist, and certainly did not work for the Foreign Office.  The \"interpreter\" was not interpreting anything, and the visitors were speaking gibberish made up on the spot.\n\nThe visitors were in fact artfully disguised members of the Bloomsbury Group, a literary and artistic coterie that had at the time attained a somewhat notorious reputation in England.  The ringleader of the hoax was Horace de Vere Cole (who never met a joke he'd turn down), but it involved a number of the leading lights of the Bloomsbury scene, such as Adrian Stephen, the painter Duncan Grant -- and a young Virginia Woolf.  They had been made to look like \"Abyssinians\" by the accomplished theatrical designer and make-up artist William Clarkson.\n\nThe hoax quickly became public knowledge and the Navy was suitably chastened.  The tricksters were never formally punished, as it was not apparent what law (if any) they had actually broken.  It became a matter of national embarrassment that a group of uncredentialed people off the street could simply board and walk around the Navy's flagship with impunity -- this, too, during a time of heightened international tensions.\n\nSecurity was tightened significantly after the hoax, thankfully, but all involved were keenly aware that it could have been far worse.",

                "It would have been the Meiji Era, which started in 1868, though giving it some time is likely, translated novels would have probably been widely available in the 1880s at the latest. \n\nBefore then, the most common translation of Western literature would have been Christian bibles, ostensibly because of the missionary efforts of various Westerners. \n\nThere's also the problem of what 'normal' Japanese people would be buying as many people may not have been literate enough to partake in reading novels throughout various periods of Japan's history. \n\nAlso, the import of books would have been low before this period as trade with Westerners itself was heavily restricted until the opening of Japan after Perry's famous visit. \n\nBut once the Meiji Era began, literature of all sorts poured into Japan while literacy rates shot up with school reforms. \n\nWhat is interesting is that many of the translations of literature wouldn't have been from English (or French, German, Russian,etc) into Japanese. Rather, especially in the beginning, most of the translations were made from Chinese translations of famous works. \n\nThis is due to the lack of qualified and experienced translators who had the knowledge and skill to translate from Western languages to Japanese, which itself was due to the fact that Japan had only limited contact with the West before the Meiji Era. Meanwhile, the Japanese and Chinese languages are much more similar, relatively speaking, which greatly facilitated early and quick dissemination of a lot of key works of Western literature. \n\nChina's intellectuals had long been exposed to much of the West's great works in medicine, philosophy, novels and essays. Balzac, Hugo, Shakespeare... \n\nMuch of Japan's first translations came via Chinese to Japanese translation. Meanwhile, Japan sent a veritable army of intellectuals to Europe to study among them, learn their language and ways, and bring back anything and everything that would be useful, novel and extraordinary to those back home. \n\nAs for the physical books themselves, Japan (and China and Korea) had been printing books for a long time. The game changing Gutenburg press had already been in Japan nearly 300 years before, since the early 16th century, so they had no problems printing books for people who wanted them. \n\nEuropean styled bookstores would have come later, though books could be bought in regular markets, from traders, institutions of learning or archival, etc. \n\nAll this being said, Japan's government's focus was mainly on works about politics, governance, military and medicine, scientific knowledge. Literature would have had its place but the government's focus would have been elsewhere, meaning better translations of literature and play would have been longer in coming. \n\n\n\n\n"

                "I'll answer at least one of your questions: at least for Mecca, this rule was not put in place by the House of Saud. During WWI, both France and the UK were in close contact with the Hashemite Sharif of Mecca, and Mecca was closed off to non-Muslims, giving France an advantage because they had Muslim officers of a relatively high rank, which the UK lacked.\n\nSource: Rémi Kauffer, *Histoire des Hachémites*.",
                "This rule goes back a long way and predates WW1. It is useful to consider the account of Sir Richard Burton who published an account of his travels in [\"Personal narrative of a pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina\"](_URL_1_) published in 1874. Due to its age and popularity, the book has been OCRed and the full text available for download.\n\nSir Richard Burton has to assume the disguise of a Sufi with Indian origins to make his visit in 1855-56. He was an excellent linguist and had spent a lot of time travelling in India and Arabia so he could get away with it.\n\nHowever, Burton was not the first. The place had been visited several times over the years back through 1504 by Ludovico Verthema, but the problem of having to visit in disguise didn't seem to happen until the early 19th century with the visit of Catalan Domingo Badia y Leblich when as a result of the political and religious problems, the cities became closed in effect even not in fact (i.e., you would probably be murdered or arrested as a spy). \n\nApart from Burton, mention should be made of John Lewis Burkhardt a Swiss who also travelled there and slightly predated Burton. He wrote the two volume book [\"Travels in Arabia\"](_URL_0_) which gives a good account of the Haj pilgrimage.\n\nA good summary of the general travel history is \"Literary History of Travel and Exploration: A-F\" Edited by Jennifer Speake page 32 in \"Arabia\".",
                "Your question has already been sufficiently answered above but I just thought I'd mention an interesting fact about the French assistance to the Saudis during the Grand Mosque Seizure in Mecca in 1979. The Mosque has been seized by a few hundred very well armed fundamentalist jihadis and the Saudi army wasn't up to the job of taking it back. They (secretly) had to call in the French special forces to help and so just before they joined the attack a number of French soldiers converted to Islam on the spot. \nSource: Trofimov, *The Siege of Mecca*"

He trained an army from these followers, defeated three Roman forces sent to subdue him, and held out for two years.\n\nInitially, Spartacus was helped by the Romans having no legions in the area, their forces being off fighting against a revolt in Hispania and in the Third Mithridatic War in Asia.  Although these concurrent wars were somewhat helpful to Spartacus, the Roman enemies in these wars were never supporters or allies of Spartacus.\n\nSpartacus tried to get some external support  when he made a bargain with Cicilian pirates to transport his forces out of Southern Italy (where they were trapped by the Romans) across the straits of Messina to Sicily.

                "Water piping is a really complex infrastructure, and it's really interesting how everything fits together.\n\nWater pumps provide the initial pressure from a source. There are a lot of different mechanisms of pumping fluid, but effectively they just add energy to the fluid to get it moving and exert pressure. This usually feeds into water towers, which create pressure through height. Imagine sitting at the bottom of a very deep pool - this pressure can force all the water beneath it, which creates positive pressure which can 'pump' water, no electricity or mechanical power required.\n\nWater meters come in [many shapes and sizes,](_URL_0_) and some of them are very clever.\n\nThe waste piping doesn't get pumped at all. Waste water, such as that from your shower, sink, or toilet, either flows into a sewer (which is completely sloped downhill, so the fluids flow naturally) or into a septic tank, which must be regularly pumped and evacuated.\n\nA single pump can pressurize a lot of water. If you have a pipe full of water, pushing a little bit more water into the end causes the exact same amount to flow out on the other side. There can be some inline pumps to help increase the pressure, but most city water mains only rely on a single pump with a water tower to pressurize all the lines even if there's an electrical shutdown.",

There is a meter on each house that counts how much water passes it.\n4.) There is no drainage, when the taps are closed water just doesn't flow into the house it goes to the next house and so on. There is a recirculation system at the end that pumps water that isn't used back through the system. Pressure stays the same since the water is always flowing.\n5.) Same way as the intake piping. They aren't connected though since that would be gross.\n6.) Water towers use gravity to create the water pressure for the intake system. Waste pipes are declined in a way that the shit flows down hill, it isn't pressurized.",

                "In one word: luck.\n\nHowever, there are two  important further points:\n\n1. That luck needed to be backed up by a powerful military, an economy that could support that military, the administrative and political skills needed to build that military, and the political and military skills to put that military to effective use.\n\n2. The Jin conquest of northern China also benefited from luck, and the factors in point 1 above.\n\nThus, what was the difference? Let us begin with the Jin.\n\nThe Song-Jin wars of 1123-1127 caught the Song when they were significantly weaker than usual. Their wars earlier in the century against Xi Xia (Tanguts) had been expensive, and the latter part of those wars had been unsuccessful, and had resulted in heavy losses. Partly as a result of the economic damage from those wars, the Song faced multiple major revolts in 1119-1121, losing control of large parts of their territory for months. These revolts were expensive to suppress, diverted military forces away from where they could fight the Jin, and killed millions. Despite this, the Song proceeded into more war, against the remains of the Liao (Khitan) state. This war was in alliance with the Jin, but the Song made little progress, and gained little territory. It cost them more money, and weakened their armies further. Again, despite this, the Song basically pushed the Jin into war against them. \n\n* This weakness of the Song at the time was one major piece of luck for the Jin.\n\nFour years of warfare against the Jin resulted in the destruction of the Song field armies, and Kaifeng (their capital) was captured. The Song still held most of their territory in the north. However, along with Kaifeng, the Jin had captured the Song emperor (and his just-abdicated father, the former emperor). The Song state had been decapitated! But the two former emperors were still alive (but in Jin hands). The Song, of course, promptly had a new emperor, the 3rd in rapid succession. However, their field armies were still destroyed and time was needed to rebuild them. Further, if the Jin released the former emperors in their captivity, the situation would have been most delicate politically. Rather than continuing to fight actively in the north, the Song rebuilt.\n\n* The capture of Kaifeng, with the capture of the emperor and former emperor, and major disruption of the Song government and administrative apparatus was a second major piece of luck for the Jin.\n\nAfter rebuilding, the Song continued to fight the Jin, neither side making any great progress. Both states were powerful - the Jin much more so than before now that they had the resources of northern China, but the Song still had plenty of resources. Thus, the almost hundred year stalemate up to the Mongol-Jin wars.\n\n* The Mongol attacks on them were a major piece of bad luck for the Jin.\n\nThe above, and successful Song resistance against the Jin after rebuilding in the south was discussed by myself and u/lordtiandao in _URL_1_ and myself and u/TechnicallyActually and u/lordtiandao in _URL_0_\n\nNext, the Qing. The Manchus had already spent two and half decades grinding into Ming territory north of the Wall by 1644. This had given them more resources, both economic and military. The Chinese Banners brought not only more soldiers into the Qing armies, but soldiers skilled in the use of modern gunpowder weapons. Still, even with this, the conquest of territory south of the Wall would not be easy, even if possible.\n\n* The opportunity to form the Chinese Banners and have a stronger artillery and firearm component in their army before the conquest of Ming China was a piece of luck for the Qing.\n\nThe Ming had similar problems to those the Song had immediately before their wars with the Jin. However, the Ming's problems were worse. Economic collapse, drought and famine, and major rebellions. Their problems were so much worse that one of these rebellions toppled the Ming. Li Zicheng's rebel army, large and well-equipped with artillery, captured Beijing. The Ming emperor committed suicide. Li Zicheng proclaimed a new dynasty. The Ming state had been decapitated, and not by the Qing.\n\n* The fall of the Ming was a really major piece of luck for the Qing!\n\nEnter Wu Sangui, the general in command of the most powerful remaining Ming army in the north, who had been on his way (with his army) to defend Beijing but had been unable to get there in time. He wasn't the only one - of two other who didn't make it, Tang Tong surrendered to the rebels, and Huang Degong stood back with his army to see what would happen - he wasn't strong enough to defeat the rebels on his own. Neither was Wu Sangui, so he did the same. His army was in a unique position - on the Great Wall, between the Qing army and the rebel army in Beijing. He had been protecting China north of the Wall against the Qing, and had abandoned that territory in his attempt to defend Beijing.\n\n* The abandonment of the region north of the Wall, allowing the Qing to move in easily, was a piece of luck for the Qing.\n\nWu Sangui opened negotiations with both (the Qing also negotiated with the rebels). The Qing wanted submission, not cooperation as equals, so Wu Sangui wasn't (yet) willing to work with them. The rebels were looting Beijing, raping, torturing people to discover hidden wealth, etc., which didn't make Wu Sangui willing to work with them either. Li Zicheng wasn't happy with the lack of immediate surrender, and attacked Wu Sangui. The first two attacks were readily repulsed, which made Li Zicheng unhappy. The result of this unhappiness was Li Zicheng leading an army to attack Wu Sangui that greatly outnumbered his, which pushed Wu Sangui into cooperation with the Qing to avoid being defeated by the rebels. This made Li Zicheng even more unhappy, leading to the execution of Wu Sangui's father (who had been in Beijing when it fell) and other members of his family. Wu Sangui submitted to the Qing, their armies combined, and they defeated the rebel army, and liberated Beijing.\n\n* Wu Sangui's defection was a major piece of luck for the Qing. Had Li Zicheng and his rebels in Beijing behaved better and negotiated better, perhaps Wu Sangui would have fought on their side.\n\nThis gave the Qing control of Beijing, and the start of Ming forces joining them. Other Ming generals followed Wu Sangui's example and joined the Qing. These Chinese forces were important, perhaps essential, over the next two decades as the Qing fought to control the rest of China. The key Ming generals, Wu Sangui among them, were rewarded with large fiefs and significant autonomy in the south (later revolting - the Three Feudatories Revolt - when the Qing took steps to prevent these fiefs from becoming almost-independent hereditary kingdoms).\n\nSo, in summary, both the Jin and the Qing benefited from luck. The Qing had more luck."

                "This is from chapter 2 of [Infidels: A History of the Conflict Between Christianity and Islam](_URL_0_): *For the most part, apart from the occasional outburst of mutual antagonism, all managed to live side by sid...the cultures acquired characteristics in common, while still maintaining their distinct and separate and  identities...the superficial differences between the different groups (Christians, Muslims, and Jews) diminished. Yet the communities remained distinct: they preserved their customs and observed their own laws.* The Islamic ruling class was a thin veneer over a largely Christian society and was itself divided between Berbers and Arabs. So, the accommodation of religious minorities was at least, in part, a practical solution. Wheatcroft relates that Muslims and Christians spoke of each other in terms of fear and disgust (pp. 68-69). Even though they lived side by side for centuries there was still a lot of mutual misunderstanding as well as a fear of religious contamination. This situation lasted for about three hundred years and then Christians and Jews were either forced to convert or migrate north to Christian kingdoms. Of course the roles were reversed during the reconquista. ",
                "I just took a final exam yesterday for Islamic Civilization in Spain and North Africa, taught by a professor of Semitic Studies at the Universidad de Granada, so I can give some quick and dirty answers until someone with more expertise comes along.\n\n* Spain was ruled by Arab leaders from about the time of the conquest to the end of the Omeya caliphate (711-1031), after which a civil war split Al-Andalus into a ton of different kingdoms, some of which were ruled by Arabs (Zaragoza) and some by Berbers, who were muslims from North Africa (Granada). Later, Berber dynasties invaded from Morocco and after a time were largely defeated by Christian forces from the north, save for Granada, ruled by the Nasrids until 1492.\n\n* During the time the Arab Omeya dynasty was in charge, Christians and Jews were allowed to continue practicing their religion as long as they abided by certain laws limiting their power and paid a special tax. A lot of the Christians of Al-Andalus became arabized, and were referred to as Mozarabs, where converts to Islam were called muladíes. Some Christians scholars like Paulus Alvarus bemoaned the arabization of Christians and worried it would lead to the demise of Latin Christianity.\n\n* Arabic was widely spoken among Christian and Jewish scholars, in fact of the first Hebrew grammars is written in Arabic and compares the two language structures. Mozarabs and muladíes would occasionally try to \"pass\" as Arab to increase their social mobility, as Arabs made up the upper classes. They would take on Arab names and create fictitious geneaologies. \n\n* A Muslim man could marry a Christian or Jewish woman, but not a pagan woman. His wife could keep her religion, but her children would be Muslim. Maliki scholars discouraged these marriages because they worried about Christian influence on Islam, but they happened anyway. Conversely, a Muslim woman was forbidden from marrying outside of her faith. If the wife in a Christian couple converted to Islam, her husband would have to convert with her or divorce her. Bonus fact: a few contemporary sources describe the Omeya caliphs as having blonde hair and blue eyes due to the fact that their mothers were slave women (esclavones) bought from the north, usually France or Germany.\n\n* Due to the way agriculture was revolutionized in Al-Andalus and the sheer amount of time that the Iberian Peninsula was under Arab rule, together with the taxes that Christians and Jews had to pay for not being Muslim, I would hazard a guess that even the most rural villages were aware of who was in charge. As to whether they cared, the people who did were free to flee northward to where Christians still held power, which is what a lot of Visigoth landowners did when their lands were confiscated and distributed among their serfs during the conquest. There were some minor revolts in Córdoba in the 9th century.

                "The water molecule have a very asymmetrical electric field. This means that the hydrogen atoms and the oxygen atom in nearby molecules will form electrical bonds called hydrogen bonds. This causes the water to create large crystals. Of course unless it is frozen the thermal energy in the water is enough to break these bonds on a regular basis making it a liquid. But on the surface of the water the crystals change from a regular three dimensional crystal to a two dimensional crystal. This crystal have a force trying to contract them into the three dimensional shape. So you end up with a sort of taught skin on the surface of the water.\n\nSome insects can use this effect to walk on water. Their legs are covered in thin hairs that is designed not to break the crystal structure of the water. They rather spread the weight over a large area. This means that they can spread their weight on the water surface without going though. Therefore they can walk on the water."

        "selftext": "Hey, askscience!\n\nI come from the field of International Relations which most of you probably wouldn't consider science (and I can see the point in that). A few studies in Ethology on the causes of aggression in humans and animals have gained some popularity in IR. IR scholars are very well aware of the limited applicability of those studies to the complex situation of actual military conflict, but they're a neat starting point for further considerations.\n\nAs an overview of the studies related to human aggression in ethology I've read JOHN ARCHER 2009: \"The nature of human aggression\", in: International Journal of Law and Psychiatry 32, 202–208.\n\nAfter some research, I think the most well-known authors in regard to the study of \"animal warfare\" are [Richard Wrangham](_URL_2_), John C. Mitani and David P. Watts. They've studied territorial boundary patrol behaviour, cooperation and competition in apes. I've also come across a few other authors who've studied apes and monkeys.\n(Btw: If anyone is interested in a short read on those studies: [Discovery News](_URL_0_) or [Slate](_URL_1_).)\n\nI have some personal interest in this and wasn't really satisfied with what I found. So I did some research in other directions. I would especially like to get some insight into intraspecific conflicts among eusocial animals. The best thing I could find was TODD M. PALMER 2004: \"Wars of attrition: colony size determines competitive\noutcomes in a guild of African acacia ants\", in: Animal Behaviour, 68, 993–1004 as well as GISSELLA M. VASQUEZ  &  JULES SILVERMAN 2008: \"Intraspecific aggression and colony fusion in the Argentine ant\", in: Animal Behaviour, 75, 583 -593.\n\nNow, since I'm not a native in the field of Biology/Ethology and don't even know where else to look for information, maybe some of you could share your insights: \n\n- When and why (over what) do groups of animals fight members of their own species? \n\n- Are there any examples of weapon use, besides natural weapons like teeth/claws? \n\n- How is violence organised? How do animal groups chose their soldiers?\n\n- How is defense implemented? I know for example from my research that apes patroll borders of their territory. Do we find similiar behaviours in other animals.\n\nI'm grateful for every piece of information you can pass on to me. Reference to actual sources will give you extra gratefulness-points!\n\nSorry, if a question like this has already been asked. My search didn't turn up anything.\n\ntl;dr: I know groups of apes fight within their own species. Are there any similiar behaviours in other animals? I also know that fights among different colonies occur in some ant species. When and why do they fight?",

They in fact applied the rules of economic game theory and the Nash Equilibruim within a biological context.\n\n\nIt's very interesting that you touched upon weaponry because that was one of the things they were particularly curious about. It seems strange that stags for example grow these massive antlers which are extremely costly to grow and are by no means an efficient combat weapon. In fact there are many examples of animals growing inefficient weaponry used for intra-species duels. Whereas inter-species weaponry is usually a lot more effective.\n\n\nIt is a fascinating but complex subject and I may take some reading to really get a handle on but well worth it.\n\n\nI would recommend watching this short documentary on the evolution of sociality and culture. It explores social evolution right back to eusocial insects all the way up to exploring the selfless psyche of an emergency service worker running into a burning building during 9/11.\n\n_URL_0_\n"

However, I am aware of studies that show that using one's non-dominant hand for routine activities can improve self-discipline.\n\n >  In addition, it has been shown that simple self-control regimens, such as using the non-dominant hand for daily activities, can reduce the depleting effects of suppressing stereotypes. More recently, these results have been extended to health behaviors such as smoking cessation.\n\n >  These findings support the notion that self-regulatory strength can be increased through practice and that once increased, this newfound capacity to self-regulate can be used not only for comparatively banal tasks such as maintaining posture or using one’s non-dominant hand, but also for behaviors with important health consequences such as resisting the temptation to smoke.\n\n--- [Cognitive neuroscience of self-regulation failure](_URL_0_) (Oh yeah, **PDF warning**.)",

It's on left-handers being \"converted\" to right-handers during school (for writing). Apparently the convert left-handers (who write with their right) have increased bilateral function in (some of) the motor and language areas. I have to go read this paper now.",

                "Bottom line:  yes, you can create neuroplastic **changes** to your brain if you repeatedly use your non-dominant hand to complete tasks.  Not necessarily an improvement in plasticity, just a utilization of the mechanism.  However, if you're just brushing your teeth and using your mouse, you're not going to get very far.  To make some significant improvement in the dexterity of your left hand, you will need to do the following things:  1)restricted use of the right hand (as much as possible) 2)massed repetitive practice and 3) [shaping](_URL_5_) of the left hand.  Meaning, you should use your left hand for everything, do tasks over and over, and make them increasingly difficult as your skill improves.  This technique is known as Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy (CIMT) and it has been shown to significantly improve the motor capability in [stroke patients with hemiparesis](_URL_7_), [multiple sclerosis](_URL_1_) with similar hemiparetic presentation, [pediatric cerebral palsy](_URL_2_), [focal hand dystonia](_URL_4_), and other neurological conditions.  In the CIMT training paradigm, the stronger hand is restricted using a protective mitt for 90% of waking hours, a series of motor tasks is performed with the weaker hand for 3 hours a day for two weeks, and patients are sent home with a behavioral \"transfer package\" for them to complete assignments and score their at-home motor performance.  \n\nMultiple imaging studies have demonstrated neuroplastic changes that occur as a result of this intervention.

When the CNS becomes hyped up, adrenaline is introduced, via the adrenal glands, to the blood stream and attempts to use all immediately available sugar to turn the glucose to fuel, hence a drop in blood sugar. When you add cream and sugar, especially cream, it reduces this affect because the immediately available blood glucose is reduced because the cream breaks down more slowly into glucose since it contains fat, which becomes glucose and fatty acids when it does break down.Sugar breaks down to glucose very rapidly.. I.e. cream is higher on the glycemic index. You would momentarily feel the same if you just put sugar in your coffee but the affects would be the same as black coffee because of how rapidly sugar breaks down to glucose and the rapid absorption the CNS requires from the adrenal response.\nI always drink my coffee with cream to delay the jittery effect and keep the caffeine buzz longer because it will stay longer in my system by adding cream.\n\nTldr: it's about how the adrenal glands react to caffeine and your current blood glucose level.\n\n*wording/typo"

                "It was not an overnight thing, and Hitler essentially couped them first. \n\nHitler's rise to power coincided with a simultaneous rise of Communism and Nazism in Germany. The conservatives in question (e.g. Hindenburg and the Catholic Center Party) favored Hitler over the Communists. After the Reichstag fire they gave him the power to crack down on Communists with paramilitary operations. All through this time Hitler consolidated his power with the German government, making sure that important posts were filled with people who were loyal to him. \n\nThe deciding moment, if there was one deciding moment, was the passage of the Enabling Act. The NSDAP used all of their power to sway the Reichstag vote, including actually physically prohibiting opposition from showing up. They received assistance from the Center party only after giving their leaders assurances that President Hindenburg would retain a veto, but after the passage of the Enabling Act the state was essentially a dictatorship. \n\nWho would have led such a coup against Hitler at this point? The Communists and Social Democrats? Already unpopular and now banned or oppressed by the brownshirts (the Sturmabteilung). The moderate left? Not strong enough. The conservative center? By this point, not strong enough. The military? They more or less supported Hitler because he wanted to make them bigger and stronger. (And eventually non-supporters were purged.) \n\nThere are two wrong popular American perceptions of Hitler's rise to power. One is that it was a totally populist movement, a genuine will of the people. The other is that Hitler just showed up and took control and forced everyone to do what he said. The truth is somewhere in between — a mixture of just enough popular support (and popular dislike/distrust/fear of the Communists, who were for a time waging an active, violent insurrection to gain control of various areas of the country) to get into a powerful position, mixed with enough means and moxie to leverage that position into a dictatorship that, once embarked upon, could not be reversed. \n\nWhen I was an undergrad and studying this stuff more closely, the book I found most useful for fully understanding how the Nazis really took over and consolidated their position in the German state was Turner's _Hitler's Thirty Days to Power: January 1933_. It sounds like a weird self-help book, but it does a great job of emphasizing how many people underestimated Hitler, and how their support of him was more about their lack of support for what they saw as the alternative (Communism).

This may sound like an insanely large volume, but it doesn't seem that much when you find out that all water on Earth comes out to a volume of 1.4\\*10^(21) L. **In other words, all of the gases in the atmosphere when compressed would occupy less volume than half a percent of the volume of water on Earth!**\n\nTo give you a better visual of what that would look like, if all the water on Earth were bunched into a sphere, it would look [like the larger sphere in this picture](_URL_0_).

                "Yes, they would. It is a tad hard to write an extentive answer over this because the main material we work with when it comes to configurations of armour are art pieces, which show contexts in which soldiers and knights choose not to wear gloves. My favourite french manuscript, the BNF 2643 (a 1470s edition of froissarts chronicles) depicts things in great detail and shows soldiers without gauntlets rather commonly. This is also sometimes seen illustrated in fencing treatises, one example being the Gladiatoria group which also showcase not using gauntlets rather commonly\n\nNow obviously written mentions are better when it comes to this, but equipment laws and regulations do not really share what wouldn't be worn, only what would. With that being said though in most of these statutes gauntlets are not mentioned as necessary wear, except for some cases in England and Scotland where the soldiers are told to specifically be armed with iron gauntlets. This is around the mid-14th century, and as far as I have seen later statutes in the 15th century do not mention gauntlets either.\n\nSo to clarify - yes there are cases where knights and footsoldiers opted out of wearing gauntlets. This is more common with footsoldiers, partly because they're less well equipped in general but partly because of ther use of long polearms in the late middle ages (such as pikes and halberds/glaives/bills, while knights commonly used shorter lances and pollaxes) which lessens the need for hand protection"

Rather, the officer may ask you to recite a portion of the alphabet (i.e., from \"e\" to \"x\").In some cases, you may be asked to say or write down the entire alphabet.\n\nWhile you are reciting the ABCs, the officer will look for signs of alcohol or drug impairment. These include slurring your speech, starting the test early, having problems reciting the alphabet correctly and difficulty following directions. If you exhibit one or more of these signs, you could be arrested for drunk driving.\n\nProblems with the ABC Test\nThe ABC test is not one of the three field sobriety tests standardized by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), and there are no consistent guidelines on how it should be administered. This means that one officer may provide different directions or look for different signs than another officer, rendering the test score unreliable.",

                "Yes, there definitely were touring music groups before radio. In the U.S., dating back to the early 1800s, there was the tradition of touring \"minstrel shows\" with white musicians performing in blackface.\n\nTwo of the more notable such groups were the Virginia Minstrels, formed in the 1840s who popularized the song \"Jimmy Crack Corn\", and the Christy Minstrels, led by Edwin Pearce Christy and also formed in the 1840s who popularized several songs by songwriter and \"father of American music\" Stephen Foster, including \"Camptown Races\" and \"Swanee River\".\n\nLater on, in the 1880s, the vaudeville circuits began to emerge, and these venues invariably included travelling music acts at their nightly performances. Early vocalists performing on the vaudeville circuits before 1900 include Marie Cahill, Maggie Cline, Sam Lucas, Charlie Case [sic], Pauline Markham, and John Bunny.\n\nIn the first couple decades of the 1900s, before radio became a household item in the late 1920s, some of the touring vaudeville performers who sang onstage might be more familiar: Helen Hayes, Fanny Brice, Eddie Cantor, the Marx Brothers (started out solely as musicians), W.C. Handy, Maurice Chevalier, Ma Rainey, and more.\n\nEDIT:\n\nRe-reading your question, I didn't talk much about musical *groups*. There certainly were many, including the minstrel groups mentioned above. A lot of them from the 1800s would be family bands, with names like the [McGibeney Family](_URL_2_), the Barriston Sisters, and the [Girard Brothers](_URL_0_). There were also touring classical bands such as the [Germania Musical Society](_URL_1_).\n\nSources:\n\n*From Traveling Show to Vaudeville: Theatrical Spectacle in America, 1830–1910* by Robert M.

                "As a follow-up question, I'd be interested to know how new weapons became adopted in a more general sense over time in pre-modern Europe. Is it typically a conscious decision made by military commanders, or was the transition so gradual that nobody really thought about how people a few hundred years earlier were fighting in a different manner than they were?",
                "Pre-answer TL DR: No it didn't.\n\nMinor notes: You're probably thinking of what everyone thinks about when they think Roman Army. Legionnaires, armed with Lorica Segmentata, Gladius, Scutum and etc, (The latter two simply mean sword and shield in Latin, but have become associated with the specific arms in the modern age) but I'm going to range a bit more and even move into the Byzantine period, because it may be helpful to talk a bit about the development of the Roman army and its style of warfare in answering this question.\n\nReal Answer Time: While the Roman army was famously adaptable, and used many different sorts of weaponry, I have come across no mentions of any sort of focused attempts to improve the quality of equipment in the sort of way you might see with military R & D in the modern age. While the equipment, techniques and tactics of the Roman military evolved over the years, the changes were more like the natural phenomenon of evolution than focused R & D. They absorbed tactics, utilized new equipment as it was developed or encountered and changed their methods as old ones were found inadequate to new situations, but when there were focused attempts to reform the army, (The Marian Reforms, for example) they were generally the efforts of one or a few men over a short period of time, rather than the sort of consistent, self-sustaining effort we see in modern science. To illustrate this, I'll give a few examples of some of the changes the army underwent in its 1000+ years of operation.\n\nThe earliest accounts of the Roman army have them fighting in the Greek style, with levied hoplites as the main power of the army. While accounts are inconsistent as to precisely when, or against who (Possibly either the Gauls or the Samnites) the Romans made the change to the Manipular system, but the consensus is that it was for tactical reasons. The Greek style phalanx, while excellent from the front on flat ground, was serving them poorly in the hilly terrain of Italy against enemies who had no intention of fighting like Greeks themselves, and were happy to exploit that terrain to break up the Phalanx. (The Romans themselves would use similar methods when fighting the Macedonians years later) The maniple was adopted in response to tactical failings, but it would then go more or less unchanged for a further two centuries, until the Marian reforms.\n\nJumping forward to the famed Legion of Cohorts, while it was an adaptable force, post-Marius there doesn’t seem to have been a conscious effort to push it forward in terms of equipment. If you look, for instance, at the legionaries depicted in Trajan’s column, they don’t seem to differ much from the forces deployed in the campaigns of Julius Ceaser, a century and a half earlier. One thing that would have changed is an ever growing use and importance of non-roman troops both as Auxiliaries and in later periods in the Legions proper. This contributed to a further decentralization in fighting style, as many non-romans would continue to fight in the style of their people, rather than adopting the methods of the legion. This, in fact, made them quite valuable for plugging holes in the roman fighting style. Much of the Roman skirmishing force and cavalry was auxiliary in this period, though they did also serve as heavy infantry. \n\nMany of the changes in equipment and fighting style in the later roman period were not necessarily improvements, and certainly weren’t the result of centralized study. Rather, they were a response to the changing fortunes of the empire, which no longer had the money, political stability and manpower to support the legions of old in the numbers necessary to hold back the enemies of Rome.  We see a shift to scale and lamellar armor in this period, away from plate, not because it was more protective (it probably wasn’t) but because it was cheaper and easier to produce and maintain, making it more attractive to roman coffers drained by financial collapse, inflation/debasement, and raiding. (Some have argued that only frontline soldiers would have heavy armor at all, though this is most likely no more than situationally true.) Also, longer swords like the Spatha tend to replace shorter Gladii, again, not because they were better (Evaluating swords even today is messy business, and the question “Is this a better sword?” is generally best met with the reply “Better for what?”) but because they were more in the style of the Germanic soldiers that began to fill the Empire’s ranks as plagues and warfare drained traditional supplies of manpower.\n\nShifting even later, the Byzantine Army underwent many changes in its time, again, as a response to the changing fortunes and enemies of the empire. They adopted horse arches, and many of the tactics of the steppe forces that were so successful against Rome’s heavier legions. They avoided the pitched battles that were so common in Roman times, because their smaller, poorer and more heavily beset empire could not afford to wager armies in pitched battles the way the Empire could in the 1st or 2nd Centuries. Always, though, these changes were not as a result of the conscious study or development that we conceive of when we speak of modern military science. Rather, it was an amorphous, naturally occurring progression, composed of individual reforms, gradual changes and adaptation in the face of changing enemies and changing fortunes. \n\nLendon, J. E.

                "My response is a tad long so I’m going to split it into a parent comment and a reply to that comment. TL;DR the popularization of the maniple formation and its weaponry seems to demonstrate one instance in which \"R & D\" occurred indirectly over a period of centuries through conflict and refinement of existing weapons and tactical principles, though this process was not directed.\n\nJuliusz Tomczak of Adam Mickiewicz University discussed the evolution of Roman weapons and tactics in the fourth century BC in [this fascinating article](_URL_0_) in “Folia Archaeologica” from 2012. Ultimately, he concludes that the changes in tactical unit structure and standard infantry weapons that facilitated the use of the maniples as the constituent unit of Roman warfare during the Early Roman Republic came about due to gradual shifts occasioned by conflict with neighboring tribes and possibly the Celts. While the existing sources do not indicate any kind of research unit or single political entity or individual credited with R & D responsibilities - save for some texts asserting that Marcus Furius Camillus was personally responsible for the adoption of the metal-reinforced shield during the wars with the Celts - Tomczak explains how some technological shifts were manifested in the Roman military, with important implications for warfighting and social organization within the military. \n\nTomczak asserts that there is no clear consensus among historians as to when most changes in Roman weaponry occurred during the Early Roman Republic, while the lack of iconographical sources from the period “explains the tendency to search not for the beginning of changes, but their end” (Tomczak 39 2012). He considers the development of the pilum, the long military javelin; the scutum, the distinctive semi-cylindrical shield; and the popularization of manipular tactics, the organizational principles for tactical units you can see visualized in this [Vassar graphic](_URL_2_). The specific interval Tomczak considers is between 535 BC, after the reforms of Servius Tullius, and ending at 223 BC with the battle at the River Po between Gaius Flaminius Nepos and the Insubres tribe. This battle evinced usage of manipular formations and the weapons associated with the maniple: the javelins and gladii of the velites, the pila and gladii of the hastati, the scuta and hastae of the principes, and the thickly armored spear and swordsmen in the triarii. \n\nTomczak complains that determining the timeline for changes in military equipment and tactics is complicated by the fact that “ancient authors are not very precise or consistent in applying the names of particular types of weapons” (Tomczak 39 2012). For example, the Greek historian Polybios of Megalopolis makes no distinction between the terms [machairo](_URL_1_) and [xiphos](_URL_3_). The hasta \"could refer to either a pole weapon used exclusively for close combat or a more universal spear, which could also be thrown at the enemy\" (Tomczak 40 2012). Given the circumstances, it is not necessarily easy to pinpoint when exactly an advance in military engineering, weaponry or tactics was made or by whom it was introduced. Tomvzak defines manipular tactics as based on a loose formation with wider openings between individual soldiers than a hoplite phalanx, with a battle plan based on throwing spears and only using the sword in decisive closing combat like the use of the bayonet in Napoleonic combat (Tomczak 42 2012). The popularization of the maniple was so important for changing the way that the Romans fought that Tomczak characterizes it as “evolutionary” (Tomczak 42 2012). \n\nTo respond to the thrust of your question, in the Early Roman Republic these advances seem not to have resulted from efforts to create new tactical principles or develop new technology by any organized body in the Roman government. Rather, the locus of change in the period is variously assigned to the Samnites, a different mystery people, or the wars with the Celts and particularly “the defeat in the battle of river Alia in 390/387 BC” (Tomczak 42 2012). Alternatively, manipular tactics and their associated weapons might have always been characteristic of the way that the Romans fought and just not adequately documented by available sources. The Samnite explanation is attested by the 4th century AD pagan religious philosopher Sallustius, who says that the Romans integrated Samnite armor and throwing missiles into their standard practices and equipment (Tomczak 42 2012). Perhaps the defeat at the Caudine Forks in 321 BC could have served as the impetus for the adoption of Samnite weapons and tactics. However, the ambiguity of iconographic sources like vases and paintings from the period makes it very difficult to determine the nature of Samnite arms, which may have been substantially hellenized and which \"differed from those used later by the Romans to such an extent, that it was reflected in the gladiatorial games\" (Tomczak 45 2012). Tomczak goes into great detail on the iconographic grounds for his skepticism about the Samnite origins of manipular tactics and associated weaponry. Meanwhile, the javelin was already prevalent throughout the Apennine Peninsula and Tomczak is disinclined to accept Iberia as the potential source of the weapons of the maniple. "

You can see something though, Idk how to explain it really. It's kinda like you can see their eyes stop functioning, all those little movements, the way they focus on something, one second that's all there and the next everything is still and, well lifeless, almost like a machine powering down and coming to a complete stop. Not sure if this is correct or not but it's my experience with it.   ",

Examples:  \n*And Eurypylus, son of Euaemon, killed Hypsenor, the son of noble\nDolopion, who had been made priest of the river Scamander, and was\nhonoured among the people as though he were a god. Eurypylus gave him chase as he was flying before him, smote him with his sword upon the arm, and lopped his strong hand from off it. The bloody hand fell to the ground, and the shades of death, with fate that no man can withstand, came over his eyes.*  \nAnd (although Aeneas does not die here):  \n*The hero fell on his knees, and propped himself with his hand resting on the ground till the darkness of night fell upon his eyes.*  \nBut actually in most of the epic, a death is described as someone \"falling to the ground.\"  Interesting that the light leaving the eyes (which is how I interpret the shade/darkness falling on them) was associated with death even 3,000 years ago.  \n",

Why the moment of death is associated with this I'm not 100%, though my best guess is before stethoscopes and modern medical tech, people looked into somebody's eye to see if their were indeed dead. But that's my best guess.  ",

It's a strange feeling, to see it happen, the body just kinda switches off and that's it... nothing more, just a shell now. \n\nThe scary part was when it happened to my dad when he was knocked out for some surgery, his eyes did the whole glaze thing and he went a bit limp, my eyes shot for the anaesthetist, he pointed at the ECG machine,  heart still ticking, just sleeping. That scared me...",
                "The scientific reason is merely a cumulative effect of small, almost unnoticeable things. While alive the eyes constantly vibrate back and forth, unnoticeable to you (it's an evolutionary 'trick' that makes you not blind, associated with change detection). There's also dilation of the pupils in response to light and conscious movements on the part of the now deceased. When all of this stops suddenly due to the cessation of electrical signals from the now dead brain, it looks unnatural to your mind. ",
                "Your eyes are lubricated with fluids when you blink. The layer of fluid is thin and dries quickly, hence why we blink. After death you stop lubricating your eyes and the lubricant dries, resulting in a loss of sheen.\n",
                "There's an immediate change in the eye when someone dies, if their eyes are open, because there's no longer any focus to maintain, so there is a dramatic effect. But the \"light\" is somewhat of an exaggeration, naturally, based on the emotion of the experience. Having opened thousands of body bags, I can confirm that some dead people look just totally alive including the eyes. It's always a little creepy when you unzip and they just happen to be looking straight at you with clear eyes, because 19/20 times they're closed or not looking at you or deflated, bandaged etc. I have let out a small yelp when I was doing things mechanically whilst talking to a coworkers only to be met with a crisp fixed stare from the table.",

I never saw him completely stop breathing but I certainly did experience the mechanical gurgling death breaths shortly before.  What really got me was watching my dad lose his appetite and start to not finish meals.  He forewarned that would signal the end and he was correct.  I still have the light of his eyes in my heart however, and most likely will forever.  "

                "According to William Scott Wilson's biography [The Lone Samurai](_URL_0_), Musashi did have around 60 confirmed duels, starting with his defeat of Arima Kihei at age 12 (Stated as 13 in The Book of Five Rings, as infants were considered to be already 1 year old at birth in Japan at the time). That being said, much of Wilson's book is pieced together from varying sources, some conflicting. It isn't unreasonable to say the number may well be inflated. \n\nAs far as what constitutes a victory changed for each duel, some were fought to the death, and others mere tests of skill against one another. Musashi was famous for often fighting with a bokken (a wooden practice katana), even against live swords. Some of these fights still ended in the deaths of his opponent, perhaps most famously Sasaki Kojiro, the Demon of the Western Provinces. Legend states that Musashi carved a boat oar to a bokken while in route to the duel, where he quickly struck down his opponent, and finished him off by caving in his chest. After this duel, Musashi's status as a swordsman was solidified, and he stopped finishing his duels with such extreme prejudice. From about 30 onward, he stopped killing his opponents, instead proving his superior skill by not allowing his opponent to make any ground, and generally out moving them. Most opponents quit in frustration. This continued into his late fifties. Considering he started at age 12 with his defeat of Arima Kihei, and the variety of duels fought over his life, I personally believe the claim. I'd highly suggest reading Wilson's biography. It's considered one of the most complete and accurate biographies available on Musashi.",

",
                "As someone else said, tone exists on percussion instruments. And there are a lot of other things to take in to consideration. Take a simple snare drum. It can be played a lot of different ways: snare on; snare off; sticks, brushes, mallets; on the head or on the rim; and so on. And each of those has its own variations. A good drummer is going to hit the drum when, where, and with what she's supposed to. A great drummer is going to interpret the piece and make appropriate adjustments in dynamics and technique.\n\nLet me give a simple example. When I was in my college jazz ensemble, we played a concert with a drummer named Matt Wilson. For part of that, Matt took a snare drum to center stage and did a solo (that's why I used the example above). He played different rhythms at different dynamics using different techniques. At the end of the solo, he was just using brushes, getting quieter and quieter. Eventually, he was still moving the brushes but not touching the drum with them. Even when he stopped moving altogether, the audience sat and listened for several seconds before bursting into applause.\n\nHe could have gone out and played a bunch of rhythms and ignored tone, dynamic, engagement, and everything else. But he didn't. That's the difference between a good drummer and a great on.",
                "I used to be in a youth symphony (although I wasn't a percussionist). Off the top of my head, here are qualities that would make a great percussionist:\n\n- ability to play many percussion instruments to a high degree of competency\n- ability to listen carefully to the other instruments so that you can make sure your sound is well balanced with theirs, you are playing in sync with them, and you aren't drowning them out\n- ability to improvise; memorization of various cadences or styles so that you can play your own music on the spot\n- ability to play really fast\n- ability to read sheet music perfectly on the first read-through\n- ability to play a perfectly steady beat, just like a metronome, with perfectly evenly spaced beats, over a long period of time (requires a lot of practice and control)\n- ability to very smoothly and gradually change tempo and dynamic range, without sudden or jerky changes unless you want them (having a very fine degree of control)\n- intimate knowledge of proper care, maintenance, and techniques for various instruments\n- intimate knowledge of music history and different musical genres and how to play appropriately for each genre\n\n\nA real percussionist would probably have more to add to this list."

On smaller scales where you have things like galaxies and planets, there is no real expansion.\n\nBut be careful, because this is the sort of question that often gets people saying things which are completely incorrect. As a rule of thumb, if someone says that things on Earth (say) don't expand because intermolecular bonds or gravity or whatever \"overcome\" the expansion, don't listen to them. With one notable exception (which I'll mention soon), the expansion is *not* some universal force which fills everywhere and everything. It's an effect which occurs on the largest scales, where the Universe appears to be uniform, and is more like the upward motion of a ball thrown into the air than the upward motion of a propelled rocket. Once the ball turns around and starts to fall, there's no more \"upward force\" trying to bring it up, and similarly when a part of the Universe starts to collapse and form galaxies, there's no residual \"expansion force\" doing things on smaller scales.\n\nThere is one exception to this, which is the cosmological constant that may be causing the expansion of the Universe to accelerate. If the acceleration is due to a cosmological constant, that actually modifies Newton's gravitational force so that there is indeed some effect felt on small scales. In some more exotic cases, the cosmological \"constant\" can grow stronger with time, resulting in a \"big rip\" that eventually tears apart objects on the smallest scales. There are also models in which the accelerated is caused by something which wouldn't affect anything here on Earth, though, so we await more data to know for sure!"

                "Yes, although the feudal or class-based elements, which exist but are *very* different in Islamdom, mean that the parallel is imperfect.\n\nThe approximate Arabic equivalent term for \"chivalry\" is [furusiyya](_URL_0_), which maintains many of the martial qualities of horse-borne warfare, but has fewer of the social connotations. In Europe, courtly or chivalric loves becomes associated with the martial qualities of knights and the nobility. While a similar literary concept exists in the Arabic world in the from of Udhrite love poetry, as far as I'm aware there was no real expectation that it be associated with furusiyya.\n\nAs I mentioned, the practice of furusiyya, though it certainly involved a kind of warrior caste status, that caste status could and often did differ markedly from the situation in Europe. In much of the medieval Islamic world, for instance, the military class were technically slaves, as in the example of the Egyptian Mamluks. Nonetheless, whether free or unfree, these horse soldiers very often occupied the same military ruling class positions as their feudal counterparts in Europe. \n\nThe forms of land grants and tax farming in the medieval Islamic world varied considerably, and in turn differed significantly from the various forms of European feudalism (leaving aside the entire European medievalist debate about what that was.) As a category, however, medieval Islamic land holding or tax farming rights were part of the \"Iqta\" system, of which the \"military iqta\", the granting of land or taxation rights to this military caste in reward for service, was typical.\n\nWhere it differed perhaps most markedly from the European nobility is that, at least in theory, the Iqta was entirely at the discretion of the Sultan and was not (necessarily) hereditary, though in practice it could be.\n\nThis was also true of the caste as a whole, so for example while Mamluks occupied the highest-status military positions in society, their children, the awlad an-nas, actually *could not* inherit their fathers' martial status (again, at least in theory. At the margins and over time the institutional clarity of this practice could fluctuate)."

                "I'm pretty sure 'molten ice' isn't a technical term. \n\nCryovolcanos are exactly what they sound like - *ice volcanos.* They only occur on moons or dwarf planets where it is really cold. On these planets, chemicals that would normally be gasses on earth can be found in solid form - ices made of ammonia, methane, nitrogen, and water can be found in abundance on these planets. Instead of the body having a rocky crust where volcanoes can erupt molten rock (which is stupid hot), these bodies have an icy crust, where volcanoes can erupt 'molten ice.' \n\nBasically, pressure builds up when the ice melts or sublimates, and can cause eruptions.\n\nI don't think the mechanism for the melting is fully understood, and different mechanisms have been proposed for different moons/dwarf planets where cryovolcanoes have been observed. The most obvious first guess is that these bodies have warm cores, and as the core cools that heat creates the gasses which are later expelled, perhaps similar to how you might imagine hydrothermal vents. Another mechanism is tidal heating. Some moons are imagined to have oceans underneath all their ice, kept warm by the constant pulling and stretching by their planet's gravity. This mechanism, or chemical reactions in the oceans, could produce the ejecta that we see. \n\nLet me try and dig up a few sources on these."

                "The answer to your last question is \"yes\" but I find the story itself utterly impossible. Radiation can cause computer chips to malfunction, but to penetrate just the chip housing (not to mention computer casing, the building, train car, or more than some meters of air) the radiation from the supposed radioactive cows would need to be in form of gamma radiation. Alpha and beta particles simply cannot penetrate even the flimsiest of obstacles and attenuate rapidly in air as well.\n\nGamma ray sources sufficiently powerful to be even detectable in a neighboring building as a train passes by would be very rapidly lethal to any animal unfortunate enough to have ingested one. \n\nHowever, it is true that the USSR introduced radioactive food inadvertently into food supply following the Chernobyl accident. The largest source of radioactivity in food was milk from cows outside the initial exclusion zone (30 km from the plant). While the exclusion zone was evacuated, farmers outside the zone were told to continue their work, and pastures and meadows were used as if nothing had happened. Unfortunately, the grass their cows ate was in many cases strongly contaminated by radioactive iodine-131 in particular. \n\nBefore Soviet authorities could get their act together and begin monitoring food supplies, significant quantities of contaminated milk (and quantities of other foodstuff) had been shipped and consumed. Milk was largely responsible for the largest single documented health damage from Chernobyl accident: radioactive iodine in it concentrated in the thyroid glands of children and adolescents, resulting to (estimated) 4000 cases of thyroid cancer, including 15 deaths as of 2006.\n\nThe sad thing here is that iodine-131 contamination is very short-lived and merely banning milk and vegetable sales from the more contaminated regions for a few months would have prevented thyroid cancers almost entirely. \n\n**Sources**\n\nMedvedev, Z.

                "I’m more familiar with the Civil War than the WWI recovery and the WWII recovery but I’d like to point out that there were two massive factors to the WWII recovery plan which were kind of opposite lesions from the Civil War.   \n\nWith the Civil War, there was a lot of destruction requiring repair.  There were massive social and economic transformations required as part of the ending of slavery.   Those were drivers to encourage investment.  On the flip side of the coin, much of the South remained in active rebellion via the KKK and in lynching blacks and maintaining white power.   Many Northerners did not share President Lincoln’s and Johnson’s general sense of forgiveness and these Northerners wanted to punish the South.   The federal government needed to occupy the South for a while to ensure the peace and protect the blacks.  The South wanted the North out and eventually got their way.   In hindsight, a lot was lost with social progress but at least the South remained loyal and peaceful, at least towards the whites.  America didn’t spend a ton of money on recovery and it worked more or less fine.  \n\nWWI came and finished and the punishments placed on Germany were severe.  Germany couldn’t recover and add in the Great Depression and the economic disaster lead straight to WWII.   \n\nSo, there was a massive lesson there.   You don’t destroy the conquered economy.  Help it recover.   \n\nThe second massive concern was Communism.   The world saw what it did to the wealthy leadership in Russia.   The end of WWII was obviously the start of the Cold War with Russia.   America needed strong allies.   So, the biggest well known stated reason for plans like the Marshal Plan to help the Western countries recover were to build strong economies that would align with America against communism.   So, again it was in America’s interest to dump in a ton of money into friendly economy’s to help them grow and encourage a strong western economy.   \n\nSo, I just scratch my head to think of major ties to the Civil War as America seemed to get away with something (I.e. underinvestment and abandonment) that clearly didn’t work after WWI.

                "I don't know about Henry Fonda and Jimmy Steward, but there was a component of Hollywood that was welcomed by the military, and even tacitly encouraged: Directors. In 1941, Frank Capra, John Ford, John Huston, George Stevens, and William Wyler were all well beyond the age in which they could have been drafted, but decided on their own accord to join the war effort. The footage they shot is of immense cultural, esthetic, and historic value.\n\nJohn Ford, famous for his Westerns and winner of the Academy Award for Best Director in 1935 and 1940, was the first of the “Five” to enlist: Ford joined the Navy as a Major in 1941 (he was 47). The Navy had no film or photography department at the time of his enlistment, so Ford was put to work founding it. His documentary on the Battle of Midway and his propaganda film \"December 7th\" would win him two academy awards when he was in service. Ford is the director whose footage gets closest to the action: he was injured by shrapnel when filming the Battle of Midway, and closely followed the first wave of landings on Omaha Beach, directing a team of cameramen from behind beach obstacles. Ford would remain an active Navy Reserve Officer and would return to active service in the Korean War, being promoted to the rank of rear admiral on his last day of active service. After World War II he returned to directing with mixed hits and flops, but was most successful when directing what he directed best: Westerns.\n\nFrank Capra took the most “direct” route into the war effort. Enlisting at 44 years of age a few days after Pearl Harbor, he had left his role as arguably the biggest (certainly most award-winning) headlining director in Hollywood because of what he called “guilt” but more closely resembled insecurity stemming from his status as an Italian-born immigrant. Capra was awarded the rank of Major and was assigned to work directly under Army Chief of Staff George Marshall (who later would become Secretary of State under Truman and mastermind the Marshall Plan). Over the course of the war, Capra would produce a seven-film series of films titled “Why We Fight”, a series of documentary films to be screened to soldiers. Although doubtlessly of great propagandistic value in terms of their effects on morale, the films also went into great detail to explain the specific social and political situation in Europe and the Far East, laying down under no uncertain terms why, precisely, the American G.I.’s were fighting. The films were a huge success, in both terms of impact on the troops and in terms of achievement as films; the first in the series, ‘Prelude to War” won the 1943 Academy Award for best documentary. Capra’s star power was integral in securing participation from Walt Disney to create animated diagrams, and several Hollywood composers were involved in composing the score. Today the films are considered a vital piece of Americana.\n\nJohn Huston was slightly disappointed on having joined only to find himself attached to the Army Signal Corps on the Aleutian Islands in 1941 (he was 35 at the time). This didn’t stop him from producing a short but critically acclaimed documentary on the Air Force pilots that repelled the Japanese offensive at Dutch Harbor, on the Alaskan mainland, as well as the Battle of Midway farther south. Huston, who was first and foremost a screenwriter (he had only directed one feature before enlisting, albeit a massively successful one: \"The Maltese Falcon\") found himself on the short end of Army censorship at the time, and his features were heavily edited (Army leadership believed them to be \"demoralizing\"). His documentary on PTSD \"Let There Be Light\" was only de-censored in 1981. Unlike Capra and Ford, Huston was less of a headlining director, and his war service was a great career trampoline: he would go on to direct a number of classics between 1949 and 1975.\n\nThe most difficult and traumatizing wartime experiences are tied to George Stevens, and they weren’t all in combat. Made commander of the Pictorial Services of the Army when he enlisted in 1943, he filmed D-Day and the liberation of Paris, but his most noteworthy work he produced was shot when he entered Dachau Concentration camp with his film crew on its liberation. Following the war, it would take him a few years before he would return to directing. He never again worked on a comedy, a huge deal for the director who prior to the war had made a name for himself filming light-hearted movies starring Katharine Hepburn, Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. Following his service, he would direct \"A Place in the Sun\" in 1951 (which would win six Academy Awards including Best Director), \"Shane\" in 1953 (nominated for an oscar), \"Giant\" in 1956 (again willing the Oscar for Best Director) and finally \"The Diary of Anne Frank\" in 1959 (for which he would be nominated for Best Director).\n\nFinally, William Wyler was a German-born Jew with more to prove than even Frank Capra: his cousin was Carl Laemmle, founder of Universal Pictures. He had been shipped off to Los Angeles in 1923 at the age of 21 to work for his cousin after the young man showed little or no interest in the family haberdashery business. However, once in Los Angeles, he (with ups and downs) worked his way up from the bottom of the studio ladder, and once he got into a directors chair he proved that he belonged there: directing such classics as \"Dodsworth\" (1936), \"These Three\" (1936), \"Dead End\" (1937), and \"Wuthering Heights\" (1939), gaining a reputation as a perfectionist who demanded take after take from his actors. However, some guilt attached to his german roots might have pushed him to direct \"Mrs. Miniver\" in 1941, the story of the travails of a middle class English family adjusting to the war in Europe. \"Mrs. Miniver\" won five academy Academy Awards, including Best Director. Wyler, who had become a U.S. citizen in 1928, enlisted in the Army Signal Corps in 1942. He was attached to several bombing missions, and the resulting documentaries gained critical acclaim: \"Memphis Belle,\" the story of a B-17 Flying Fortress bomber was a personal favorite of President Roosevelt, while \"The Fighting Lady,\" the story of an aircraft carrier, won the 1945 oscar for best documentary. For Wyler, the war was also a great boost to his career, after his service he would direct such classics as \"Roman Holiday\" in 1953 and \"Ben-Hur\" in 1959.\n\nIf you'd like to read more on directors, check out Five Came Back: A Story of Hollywood and the Second World War By Mark Harris"

                "George R. Stewart has a whole chapter on this general topic in *Names on the Land*. He says that Arkansas is the only state name “about which pronunciation and spelling ever rose to be a major issue”. Arkansas/Arkansaw, originally referring to the river, was part of the Louisiana Purchase and, like many other place names in the region, Americans adopted the French pronunciation (or at least an approximation of it). And the name was often, but not always, spelled accordingly: Arkansaw.\n\nIn 1819 Congress passed a law creating a territory spelled, according to the Act of Congress, Territory of Arkansaw. In the very same year a New Yorker named William Woodruff moved to the new capital of Arkansaw Territory. Woodruff felt very strongly about language and spelling. He even attacked Noah Webster for including the word “lengthy” in his dictionary, for clearly not being a real word. Woodruff was also a printer by trade and set up a newspaper in the new Arkansaw Territory. In the first issue he printed the Act of Congress that had created Arkansaw Territory. In this Act the word “Arkansaw” occurred eight times. Woodruff felt very strongly it ought to be Arkansas, which was still a common alternate spelling. In his newspaper’s printing of the Act of Congress he changed all eight mentions of Arkansaw to Arkansas.\n\nThe population of the territory was only about 10,000, and very many could not read. And most had little to no preference over the spelling of the territorial name. In any case, Woodruff’s newspaper had a huge influence on this particular issue. As Stewart puts it, “Apparently even Congress forgot about [their] original spelling, and later bills used Arkansas”. Reprintings of the Act of Congress quickly started spelling it Arkansas, even official, federal printings. In short, official documents “simply changed the spelling without comment, as if a mere clerical error were being corrected”.\n\nAs the years passed the people of Arkansaw Territory more and more spelled it Arkansas, yet continued to pronounce it Arkansaw. In other parts of the US there was the feeling that the spelling and pronunciation should match. And as the spelling Arkansas became common some people began to pronounce it “Arkánsas”, like the state Kansas, with ar- prepended—although the place names Arkansas and Kansas have different etymologies and the close resemblance is coincidence [ed: or not, see below]. As more time passed even some of the people of the territory began to say Arkánsas. Still, both spellings and pronunciations were fairly common.\n\nIn 1836 the territory was made a state, spelled Arkansas. Yet there was still a question about pronunciation. In the 1840s the two senators from Arkansas disagreed with each other about it. In Congress this resulted in one being called “the senator from Arkansaw” and the other as “the senator from Arkánsas”.\n\nBy 1850 the issue was not solved at all, neither pronunciation or spelling. Some gazetteers spelled the state Arkansas, some Arkansaw. Some offered both, and both pronunciations too. Sometimes the state was spelled Arkansas and the river was spelled Arkansaw. As the state of Kansas became developed and well known, it helped solidify the spelling Arkansas over Arkansaw, and for many people made the pronunciation Arkánsas common—with an accent on the second syllable. Still, the people of Arkansas still overwhelmingly pronounced it Arkansaw.\n\nAfter the Civil War many people immigrated to Arkansas and brought their pronunciation Arkánsas with them. This pronunciation became common in Little Rock. Stewart says, “By 1880 anyone might have decided that Arkansaw was a dying and backwoodsy manner of speech”. However, the natives of Arkansas would not so easily change their ways, and before long the issue became important. The pronunciation, and even spelling “Arkansas” became to be condemned by natives of the state as “Yankee persecution”. Increasingly there were calls for rejecting Arkánsas.\n\nIn 1880 the legislature of Arkansas took up the issue and formed a committee to resolve things. The committee, being mostly made up of native Arkansans, was not unbiased and from the start worked for “Arkansaw”. They supported this in many ways, drawing from history, tradition, etc (though undoubtedly cherry-picking to some degree). They even cited the Yankee Longfellow, who had written “I prefer the sound Arkansaw as being more musical than Arkansas”. The committee’s final report unanimously recommended the pronunciation Arkansaw. I’m not sure if they said anything about the spelling, which by then was rather firmly established as Arkansas.\n\nIn 1881 the state legislature passed an official resolution declaring the pronunciation to be “Arkansaw”, in accord with the local manner of speech. They also declared the pronunciation Arkánsas “an innovation to be discouraged”.\n\nFor most of the country, this settled it. The state was spelled Arkansas but pronounced Arkansaw. So be it. *Except*! There is also the Arkansas River, which flows through a great deal of Kansas. The people of Kansas tended to call the river the Arkánsas River. And there was a town by the border called Arkánsas City. After the state of Arkansas declared the pronunciation Arkansaw, and the rest of the country said “okay”, dictionaries soon began to say the river was also pronounced Arkansaw, as was Arkansas City, in Kansas. Some people of Arkansas tried, mostly half-heartedly, to convince the people of Kansas to pronounce the river and Arkansas City “arkansaw”. But since they had called upon local usage tradition in their own support of “arkansaw” they could not easily say that the people of Kansas had to abandon *their* local pronunciation traditions.\n\nArkansas City, Kansas, is still pronounced Arkánsas. And in much of Kansas the Arkansas River is likewise pronounced Arkánsas. The same goes for Arkansas Street, in Wichita, Kansas.\n\nBut to answer the question directly and tersely, the spelling of Arkansaw Territory was changed to Arkansas mainly due to the efforts of William Woodruff, who started the first newspaper in Arkansaw Territory but always published the name “Arkansas”. Congress didn't seem to care, or even realize, possibly, that they had named it Arkansaw but soon began spelling it Arkansas. As for why the spelling and pronunciation don’t match, it is because both come via the earlier French place names—the same reason the same is true for Illinois.\n\n*Names on the Land*, George R. Stewart.\n\nedit PS: Stewart might be wrong about the etymology of Arkansas and Kansas being unrelated. William Bright, in *Native American Placenames of the United States* says they *do* derive from the same Siouan root, but there is some additional complexity I don't have time to get into at the moment. One bit though is that Arkansas comes from a French interpretation of an Algonquian language term, which involves a Siouan term within it.\n\n(edit: tpyos, words)"

You see, carbon has a tendency to link to other carbon, and hydrogen links to it very easily, so basically these long strings of hydrocarbons form cells and life as we know it.  And fat.\n\nSo [here is gasoline](_URL_1_) - you can see it's also carbons and hydrogens, perhaps forming a circle (benzene ring), maybe an oxygen in there.\n\nSo what happens is fat decomposes to these oils (still carbons and hydrogens) and we pump them out of the ground and \"refine\" them - separate the ones that burn easily from the sludge (fat) that doesn't burn as easily.  A refinery basically puts out a slew of products, from gasoline to diesel to various oils to tar.  Just separated, rotted hydrocarbons that burn easily (or less easily).\n\n",

                "Although I would love to see NK dismantled, the brute reality of the situation might be that the costs associated with successfully hunting down its leaders, \"rehabilitating\" its people and avoiding blowback are too high. \n\nRemember how quickly we overthrew Saddam's regime? We still spent years tracking down his family and supporters. \n\nRemember how the North Koreans wept for Kim Jong Il after he died? Sure, some of the mourners may have been acting to avoid punishment, but it's likely that many, if not most, of the population cannot distinguish propaganda from reality. Us deposing Kim Jong Un might be like killing their Christ, and their reaction to US troops, who they've been told are evil, blowing their leader's brains out may be unfavorable. \n\nLet's say you've crushed the NK military, how've you done it? You've probably used a lot of bombs and missiles and tried to limit the number of instances your troops have had to expose themselves to physical combat. Historically, our use of munitions causes a lot of civilian casualties. Historically, that eventually makes enemies of the people we were supposedly trying to help. This ends up meaning that you've simply substituted one, old enemy for another newer enemy. \n\nI think that policymakers have this is mind when deciding how to deal with NK. An invasion of NK could end up pointless and costly. The fact that NK doesn't have anything we really want or need probably factors into why we haven't invaded NK as well: invasion might be a financial black hole and there no obvious chance for recoupment. \n\nI believe we haven't done anything about Saudi Arabia , because, like Gyang193 said, it's relatively stable and provides us needed resources. Additionally, Saudi Arabia is one of the only Middle Eastern countries that doesn't like Russia and can bleed Russia (without Russia seeking retribution) by lowering the price of its oil (Russia top export is oil...second top is vodka). ",
                "The UN is not a government. It doesn't have soldiers or police.\n\nThe UN is a forum where governments meet to discuss world relations. Anyone could suggest sanctions against Saudi, and in fact plenty of people complain about Saudi at the UN. Saudi Arabia's human rights record was the subject of constant debate until recently when they became a member of the committee on human rights, and will be again when that appointment has passed.\n\nMore broadly, what you mean to ask is 'Why hasn't America done something about Saudi Arabia?' The answer, sadly, is Communism. During the cold war, America's primary concern was maintaining a power bloc. Since then, we haven't significantly reshuffled our alliances.\n\nMaybe we should. I'd like to think we don't need the Saudis anymore. But it's not the UN's job to make that decision for us."

                "The tricky thing about answering this question is that most etiquette books of the era are aimed at the middle classes - daughters of earls would grow up learning this sort of information at home and wouldn't care what Emily Post (or similar) thought about it. The entire point of the genre was to educate people (frequently but not always women) about the standards of middle or upper middle class life when they had not been born to it. Thus the etiquette books mainly discuss what to do at breakfast if invited to stay at another middle class house or when at a hotel.\n\nThe impression I have from the show is that this is a long-standing tradition at Downtown, so I started looking in the Victorian era. I did finally find [a British etiquette book](_URL_0_) of 1885 that says that in a country house, the hostess and host should make sure to eat breakfast with important guests at the family table, but with more intimate friends or relatives the hostess may eat in her room, by herself. I also found one 1905 (American) reference stating that if a family is rich enough, they theoretically could give every member a private breakfast, but this was in an article that was basically about how to deal with different temperaments and annoyances at breakfast, so I think it's more of an \"oh, yeah, in a perfect world *eyeroll*\" kind of thing.\n\nOn the whole, breakfast etiquette was for everyone to try to get down to the table at the same time out of politeness (since some hostesses would hold everybody until all guests were present), and in some cases it was not eaten directly after rising, but an hour or so later, so getting back in bed would make no sense. It seems likely to me that this was either an inaccuracy decided on for production/writing reasons, or perhaps Fellows spoke with someone who had worked at a country house (I know that at least for Gosford Park he interviewed people who had been in service) where this was an idiosyncratic tradition.",
                "I haven't seen much, if any of Downton Abbey I'm afraid, but given it's popularity I can imagine it being similar to a fair few estates in the North of England that I have studied, if not directly based on them.\n\nThe key thing here - and what I imagine the producers are trying to show - is that the Lady of the House has a 'Lady's Maid'.Unlike Gentlemen, who would normally receive a dedicated Valet when they were 'ready' rather than at a specific point, young women would only receive a dedicated maid upon marriage, the remuneration for whom would be down to her husband rather than father.\n\nThis maid would be responsible for things like sewing, helping dress the Lady, opening and closing windows, keeping the bedchamber neat and yes, bringing the lady breakfast in the morning. She was essentially the only person other than her husband who would see her before she was ready to leave her chambers.\n\nBy contrast unmarried women would generally not have their own maids (royalty excepted, of course), rather still having a nanny (particularly if they had younger siblings) or using the services of their favoured housemaid. Such a housemaid might bring an unmarried lady breakfast in bed, but it was not required, they had many other duties - check Mrs Beetons Book of Household Management (you can download it free online), IIRC there is a chapter 'Female Domestics' and a list of the duties within. It's pretty clear that the role was to look after the mistress first, and only when she is completely satisfied may the maid help her mistresses sisters or daughters.\n\nIn short, I imagine Downton Abbey is looking to show this position exists and exploits the breakfast scene as it would likely be the time the most conversation happened between Lady and her Maid (It was a pretty lonely job, most time would be spent alone in the chambers sewing and tidying). It wasn't so much a case of 'A married woman must not be seen having breakfast' but 'A married woman has a Lady's maid, why would she need to go down to breakfast?'.",
                "I happen to have a copy of Etiquette by Emily Post from 1945, updated from the 1922 edition, which would be about the time of the show. In a section titled \"country house and its hospitality\" she speaks about guest-room service:\n > \"In big houses, breakfast trays for the ladies are usually carried to the bedroom floor by the butler- some butlers delegate this service to a footman- and are handed to the lady's maid or else the housemaid, who takes the tray into the room. In small houses they are carried up by the waitress. \nTrays for men visitors are rare, but when ordered are carries up and into the room by the butler. If there are no menservants, the waitress carries up the tray.\nUnless breakfast is at a set time and everyone comes down promptly, the advantage of having one's guests choose breakfast upstairs is that no delayed breakfast prevents the dining room's being put in order or the lunch table set. Trays, on the other hand, can stand all morning \"all set\" in the pantry and interfere much less with the dining room work.\nEvery china store carries breakfast sets, of course, but only in \"open\" stock patterns can one buy extra dishes or replace broken ones- a fact that is well to remember. A set always comprises a coffee or teapot, a hot milk pitcher, a cream pitcher and sugar bowl, a cup and saucer, two plates, an egg cup and a covered dish. A cereal is usually put in the covered dish, toast in a napkin on a plate, or eggs and bacon in place of cereal. This with fruit is the most elaborate \"tray\" breakfast ever provided.\nWhen a guest rings for breakfast, the housemaid goes into the room, opens the blinds, and in cold weather lights the fire, if there is an open grate in the room.\""

The site suggests a wide range of beliefs associated with meteors - which were seen in various culture in both positive and negative terms. This analysis suggests that there has been a modern inclination to see the positive side of a falling star and there is an implication that the international popularity of the 1940 Disney cartoon 'Pinocchio' may have spread the idea the one could 'wish upon a star', as its central song advocates. That sort of media-based diffusion of a belief and practice is not unknown; it seems a plausible explanation to me."

                "In aerodynamics there are four main forces.  In the x direction there is thrust and drag.  In the y direction there is lift and weight.  For the plane to be in equilibrium (or level unaccelerating flight) the weight must equal the lift and the drag must equal the thrust.  So the reason is simply that thrust doesn't have to equal weight.  \rThis begs the question: how is that much lift created by such little thrust?  The thrust accelerates the plane in the y direction, the wings generate lift proportional to the speed of the air flowing over them.  This can easily be higher than the amount of thrust in the engine due to efficient air foils (or wings).  \rSource: aerospace engineering student.  I tried to simplify",
                "Lift and drag are both forces and have the same units.  Aircraft wings produce more lift than drag.  In steady level flight, thrust equals drag so the engines can get away with creating much less thrust than the total weight of the plane.",
                "It's not trying to lift it off the ground vertically - ie without the help of the wings, like a rocket. \n\nThere are fighter jets that have more thrust than weight. They  > can <  go straight up in the air.",
                "Planes don't need thrust greater than their mass to move, they only need enough thrust to initiate motion and get over the threshold set by friction from the tyres and air. \n\nThe main purpose of the engines is not to give the plane lift, it is actually to accelerate the plane to a high enough velocity for take off. The wings themselves that the engines are usually attached to generate the lift. Due to the shape of the wings, once the plane has attained a certain speed (normally quite a high speed) lift will be generated. This is because the air under the wings travels at a relatively low speed compared to above the wing, and so the air below is a higher pressure than the air above the wing. This difference in pressure above and below the wing generates the lift of the wings, and the lift produced is proportional to the velocity of the air travelling over and under the wings, which is the planes velocity, caused by the engines. This effect is described well in [this picture](_URL_0_). \n\nIn the case of a rocket, the lift generated by the engines has to be greater than the mass of the rocket itself because it is acting directly against gravity."

That's thanks to energy storage which provides a buffer between electric loads and electric generators on the grid. This is even more important as variable renewable resources, like wind and solar power, become more dominant. The wind does not always blow and the sun does not always shine, but we're always using electricity. \n\nPumped storage hydropower is an energy storage solution that offers efficiency, reliability, and resiliency benefits. Currently, over 40 facilities are sited in the U.S., with a capacity of nearly 22 GW. The technology is conceptually simple - pump water up to an elevated reservoir and generate electricity as water moves downhill - and very powerful. The largest pumped storage plant has a capacity of 3 GW, which is equivalent to 1,000 large wind turbines, 12 million solar panels, or the electricity used by 2.5 million homes!

I just watched [this excellent talk](_URL_0_) by Jesse Jenkins at the University of Pennsylvania which talked about how \"flexible base load\" is the missing piece of our future energy grid and how pumped hydro is one of the few technically feasible options we have. \n\n1. what's the average % energy loss from the 2 transitions? (electrical  >  gravitational potential  >  electrical). Wikipedia says 70-80% efficient, so 20-30%?\n2. what's the average cost / GW of installed capacity and does this have potential to drop dramatically?\n3. Are the \\~40 reservoirs isolated enough that the transmission losses there and back are significant? For example, I live in Québec, which uses (I believe) 765kV transmission lines to move the enormous amount of electricity from the hydro projects in the north. Many of these travel 2000km just to get to Southern Québec, and must travel another \\~1000km to get to the NE of the US which I assume would be the primary market for hydro storage in a future high % solar/wind continental grid. \n4. what's the realistic upper limit of pumped storage capacity in the US, Canada, and globally? (is your 22GW the number for US?)\n5. what is the biggest limiting factor for potential sites? based on the formula, stored energy is related linearly to both elevation difference and mass (ie. volume). They must be at a high altitude, with a natural basin to reduce cost (I assume). It is possible to say, pick a high mountain range and place dams in the gaps? Assuming such a geographically perfect site existed and wasn't ruining a national park), would the hydrostatic pressure at the bottom just render the entire thing too expensive? I think what I'm getting as is - does the ideal reservoir have a limited depth but a large surface area to maximize total volume?\n6. I assume pumped storage is the best energy storage solution we have with current technology. Are there any others which are promising (sodium-sulphur for example?)\n7. when you say capacity of 3GW, do you mean GWh or GW? if it's GW, what exactly does that mean? that the pumps at that site have the potential to absorb 3GW of extra generation (so 3GJ per second or 3GWh per hour?).

                "Well, some denominations do believe in predestination. Calvinists are the first to come to mind, they believe that God chose who would go up to heaven before he even created the earth.",
                "This is a complicated question and I'm not sure I understand it myself, but here goes.\n\nFirst, you talk about predestination. The apostle Paul *does* say that God has predestined those he chose, i.e. believers. Romans 8: 29-30 says:\n\n >  For those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers and sisters. And those he predestined, he also called; those he called, he also justified; those he justified, he also glorified.\n\nElsewhere, in Ephesians 1:4-5, Paul says:\n\n >  For he chose us in him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight. In love he predestined us for adoption to sonship through Jesus Christ, in accordance with his pleasure and will ...\n\nSo, apparently, God *has* predestined believers to heaven. What exactly that means, and whether this means God has predestined others to hell, are open questions, even within Calvinist circles.\n\nAs for God knowing the future, think of our experience of time as being like driving down a road you've never been on before. As you go along, a barn appears on the right, then disappears. Then the road turns a corner to the left. Then you go over a bridge, or under a tunnel, or past a cemetary, or whatever. These seem to be events, that you don't see coming. You have no idea whether the next \"event\" will be a bridge or a turn or a railway crossing, etc., because it is \"in the future\", and your entire \"life\" is confined to one-way travel on that road. But if I'm sitting at home, looking it up on Google Earth, I can tell you what happens next. It's not a surprise to me, because my experience is greater than just travelling down that road.\n\nGod's view of the future is kind of like that. He exists outside of time. God knows the future the same way I would know the \"future\" of your trip down the road, because I can see the whole thing.\n\nI admit, this isn't a perfect analogy, because your going down the road is mostly things happening to you, rather than you making choices. But in any event, you're only going to choose to do one thing. And God knows what that is.",
                "Consider this thought experiment:\n\nGod is all-powerful.\nGod can send messages back in time.\nGod could send a message back in time to Himself that tells Him of our future choices.\n\nOf course, that thought experiment is short-sighted. God already knows everything. There is no possible error in His knowledge. How does that impact free will?\n\nIt says that things in the future only have one possible outcome. And that outcome happens to be the choice we will make.\n\nFree will is magic. It's beyond logic, just like God is and the existence of anything genuinely subjective/the soul is. We have a choice to do one thing or another, and to us, our choices happen over time. However, to God, whose consciousness is not bound by time, it might be said that all our choices appear to Him \"simultaneously.\"\n\nHow are they free? Well, even if God \"didn't know the future,\" there would be no mechanism that explained a genuine, non-deterministic choice between A and B in our minds without going beyond logic itself. Free will requires going beyond logic, as does the idea that God (a subjective being) is the First Cause. The existence of a universe which *can* go only one way, and gives us *genuine* choice, can likewise only be explained by a God who \"magically\" gives us genuine choice and \"magically\" knows what our future choices will be.\n\nOf course, some other denominations would dispute that \"free will\" exists at all. I'm just going by what I receive from the Bible and Holy Spirit, and how it makes sense to me.",
                "In your statement you said he knows every choice you will make but I believe you forgot to think about Him knowing every choice you wouldn't make.  He knows all the choices of everything (chosen or not) and the relationship of all those choices to everyone through out the ages.  Whew!  That's a lot of knowing. :)\n\nWe can examine free will by saying we choose one of those choices.  We are also told God offered us this choice and He will not interfer unless we ask him to.  God is aware we have made bad choices or choices He may deem as good lessons to be learned.  Since we are very limited with understanding this life we are in no position to understand why He allows us our choices.\n\nI am going to guess that God wants us to trust Him.  We call that faith and you will see all kinds of this level of trust we call faith throughout your life starting with the faith that you know your mother loves you.  \n\nNow you know your mother loves you so why did she allow you to do certain things that would prove to be uncomfortable?  Maybe she said, stop jumping in puddles and you didn't listen?  So the results were you became wet, cold and miserable. \n\nNow you are probably thinking That's not the same thing as God allowing us to have pain and suffering and I can understand that point of view.  But I also see pain and suffering in a much bigger light.  God tells us we are infinite.   This life is but a small fraction that we will live.  I am also aware that each of us experiences pain differently than another.  Which makes me think that pain and suffering is in the mind of the beholder.  Perhaps God sees us as reacting to this as non important compared to what we learn from it?  Maybe we are just babies reacting to our envirnoment and we have a lot of growing to do?  Maybe we are designed to feel pain and suffering to teach us compassion and empathy?   So we don't become completely Narcissistic? \n\nWhich brings us back to why God would allow us to make bad choices and not intervene.  Does any of us know more than God?  Is anyone on equal terms of intellect with the all knowing?  I think I will just trust God knows what He is doing and have faith it will benifit me without me asking, \"why me?\"",

                "In the early 1990's Pfizer was testing a drug called UK92480. Their pharmacologists were working on a drug to treat anginas, a general pain in the heart or blood vessels indicative of coronary heart disease. They went to Phase I trials, but noticed little to no effect on angina. Though it may be apocryphal, it's said that even though the medicine didn't work some patients didn't want to return their supplies. During that trial an amazing side-effect was discovered: firm, long-lasting erections. Pfizer quickly scrapped the angina trials and proceeded to send the drug to trials for erectile dysfunction instead. That medicine is now called Viagra.\n\nDrug discovery is not an easy thing. We might know a generalized cause of a disease and we might know the exact pathology and we might even know the shape of the binding sites on a cell which might change some important action in the cascade of signals that cause the symptoms.  But even if we do know all of this and design a drug specifically to act on that site, there's no guarantee that our drug won't interact with other systems in unintended ways.  Nor is it guaranteed that it will alleviate symptoms as expected. IIRC, only one in 5 or 6 thousand developed medicines ever gets approved and released.\n\nAnd such is the same way that many bipolar drugs were discovered. The most famous bipolar drug, lithium, was used 150 years ago to treat severe gout. Lithium was able to quickly dissolve uric acid and, very coincidentally, acid buildup was thought at the time to be a source of many disorders of the body, including mental disorders. Later (and independently), lithium’s tranquilizing effects led one researcher to test it on unruly mental ward patients. Over the period of a few weeks, the manic patients (but not the schizophrenic patients) were healthy enough to be discharged.\nThis accidental discovery of medicines is prevalent everywhere in drug development. Available treatments for bipolar hint at this, containing not only lithium salts and anti-psychotics, but a wide array of anticonvulsants too. These weren’t originally designed for bipolar, but the effects were stumbled upon later and proved effective enough to be prescribed independent of convulsive symptoms.\n\nAnd I guess here’s the kicker at the crux of your question: you’re right.. we still don’t really know how they work. In the case of bipolar medicines, we know that the ones most effective are those that regulate serotonin and GABA reuptake at neuron junctions. But Lithium, it’s suggested, works by affecting the sodium/potassium channels along the neurons (and subsequently affecting the ability of the neuron to fire). We just don’t know.\n\nIt was a little bit disheartening for me when I learned the extent to which medical progress seemed to rely on accidents. But, as illustrated well by this example, as I became more involved with research I realized how important serendipity like this was to research. Even though we don’t know exactly the mechanism by which these medicines work, we know so much more about the disorders (and many others) *because* these medicines work. We're attacking our problems from both the practical and the theoretical, each of them informing the other as to where to go next.",
                "First, very good question with very good response, so thanks.\n\nMy only two cents to add is about Lithium, which echoes theshizzler's response about being discovered as opposed to designed.  Here's a page that explains it and the first couple of paragraphs are what I found most interesting.\n\n_URL_0_\n\n",
                "It's not uncommon to have a drug that treats a condition even though scientists have little idea why it works. When going for approval, they need to show a) that it works, and b) the benefits outweigh the side effects. A full explanation of the mechanism of action on the condition is not always required. However, information on the metabolism of the drug is very important to determine its safety.",
                "There's no reason why you need to know how a treatment works to know that it does work. Heck, you can even be completely wrong about how it works. People used to believe in the miasma theory, which said that disease is transmitted through a cloud of tainted air. They correctly noticed that staying away from sick people make you less likely to get sick. Of course, the theory is wrong, but the treatment works great.",
                "Many anaesthetic drugs (such as all the volatile anaesthetics) have an unclear mechanism of action, what we know is that they do work.  We can even create new ones and predict their properties, but the proposed mechanisms do not cover it properly.",

                "They don't. It's generally by accident and when drugs are prescribed for mental illness they are generally taking educated guesses as to what will work.\n\nThe drug a mental illness patient will use and the dosage they take is normally arrived at through a back and forth between doctor and patient, and a period of time without symptoms or major episodes, IF the patient is getting proper care. \n\nIf you know someone that has these issues and the doctors is just insisting on using one type of drug without the back and forth, then their Dr is terrible and you should suggest they get a new one.

                "The first drug that was found to be effective for schizophrenia was chlorpromazine in the earlier 1950's. It was developed from promethazine, an antihistamine (Phenergan) in an attempt to find a better sedative patients for surgical procedures. They found that it calmed patients and tested it in psychiatric patients and found unparalleled improvement in schizophrenia - it was a huge breakthrough.\n\nWhat gets more interesting is that many of our theories as to what causes schizophrenia comes from effective treatments for the condition. One of the side effects of chlorpromazine are extrapyramidal side effects, movement disorders that can be like Parkinson's disease. Given that Parkinson's disease is due to a deficiency in dopamine (and can be treated by administering the precursor to dopamine, levodopa), and chlorpromazine causes Parkinson's-like symptoms, it followed that chlorpromazine might be effective because it reduces the amount of dopamine in the brain. Obviously there's a lot more to it than that and we've learned a lot since, but new effective therapies for schizophrenia have substantially improved our understanding of the disease and in turn led to the development of new, better therapies.",
                "I don't think that they don't understand the disease, I think they just don't know exactly how it works. Knowing what receptors are firing when and then creating a drug that either acts as an agonist or antagonist for that neurotransmitter can possibly help balance mood. \n\nKinda aligns with the knowledge we have about opioids. We know that the body uses endorphins to reduce pain. Through trial and error, we found drugs that act on the mu opioid receptor worked best. \n\nIt's all about the neurotransmitters and the paths they take throughout the brain. That's my understanding at least, someone please add or correct me if I'm wrong of course! ",
                "I am typing from my phone so please excusd any typos.\n\nThere is a theory about why Lithium works as a drug. Lithium is in fact the same lithium you find on a periodic table in ionic form. It holds the same charge as sodium. Sodium is important in the body for depolarization, on im short it makes things happen in your body.  It is a major reason behund why nerves fire etc. Lithium,  having the same charge as sodium, can stabalize a cell, making it harder for it to depolarize or \"do things\".  This stabalization leads to a more stable mood.  \n\nAs a side note about another way lithium acts like sodium is in tge Kidney. It is why someone whonis taking lithium has to go tonthe bathroom a lot. Because like sodium, the lithium draws water into the kidney to be urinated out :)\n\nAs far as other things like schizophrenia,  they do have some understanding of the chemical imbalances that occur, and they do know the mechanism of action for antipysichotics. But mental disease is very multifactorial. Also there is the ethical issue that comes along with poking around a living persons brain, that prevents more reaearch being done to get the specifics.",
                "There are two ways that we can manage or treat disease states. The most ideal way is to treat the cause of the disease state *directly*. This is called primary therapy. We can also manage the *symptoms* of the disease states which is called secondary therapy. Secondary therapy is obviously sub-optimal because it only helps alleviate the symptoms of the disease and doesn't actually help cure it.",
                "Ethnobotany is one source of leads for drugs.  How natural medicine is used among tribes and civilizations has led to many (most?) of the less obvious drug discoveries.  \n\nAspirin was \"discovered\" from the traditional use of willow bark, which was practically world-wide, as an analgesic.\n\nThe issue with using natural molecules is that they are unpatentable, so that development of treatments from ethnobotanical use of a plant also involves trying to find a patentable synthetic analog, or other way to commoditize the molecule. \n\nOne example of this is how one drug company persuaded the FDA to allow them to patent Tamiflu, which is the extract of shikimic acid from the star anise seed.  Star anise is used in Ayurvedic medicine and (I believe) Traditional Chinese medicine as a cold and flu remedy (along with other herbs).  The pharma company persuaded the FDA to allow it to patent Tamiflu on the grounds that the *process* by which it extracted and highly concentrated the Tamiflu was extremely complex and proprietary.\n\n[Link to an Ayurvedic medicine web page for star anise](_URL_0_).  Disclaimer: I'm not encouraging anyone to go out to use star anise for your colds and flus.  There's a look-alike that people use in ornamental gardening here in the States that's poisonous.",
                "Many, many drugs were discovered back in the old days through what is called phenotypic screening where you simply  throw a small molecule into say a cellular experimental system and observe to see if you get a desired outcome.  This method was wildly successful, but back in the 80s and 90s with the advent of new DNA technology and molecular biology techniques, we began to move away from phenotypic drug discovery and towards what is known as targeted discovery.  Targeted discovery is where you try to understand at a molecular level exactly what causes a disease and then try to design drugs to hit exactly what molecular target might be causing disease X.  Ever since we've moved toward targeted drug discovery and this idea that it is possible to understand the exact underpinnings of a disease at the molecular level, we've become less and less successful at making new drugs.  The problem with thinking that you can understand disease at the molecular level is due to the fundamental problem of reductionism in science.  When you simply attribute a disease as being caused by pathway X in a cell,  you ignore how a cell works as a system with many different signaling networks that can produce robustness which can overcome your targeted approach and make your targeted molecule fail.  A cell has many, many moving parts and reductionism is extremely dangerous, especially when it comes to biology.  This is why many many scientists are calling for a return to phenotypic screening-- we don't really understand how many diseases work on a systems level.  That, however, doesn't mean you can't make a drug to treat those diseases through a phenotypic approach.  Contrary to popular belief,  the FDA does not require you to even know the mechansim of action for a drug, as long as a drug does what you say it will do with acceptable side effects, it is still possible to get a drug approved.  Many drugs that were discovered back in the old days through phenotypic screens that have provided tremendous therapeutic benefits for decades , when tested in panels for many targets,  often light up such assays like Christmas trees, meaning they often work by hitting multiple pathways and multiple aspects of cellular physiology.  In summary,  you dont need to know what causes a disease to make a drug; screen phenotypically and look for a desired outcome.  It has work extraordinarily well before!",
                "I read in an article once about this very topic once. The thesis of the argument was how completely backwards it is that we assume these disorders are caused by low levels of whatever the drug contains. It would be like assuming aspirin treats pain because pain is caused by a shortage of acetaminophen in the body (which we know to be completely untrue). ",
                "Lithium was a life saver for me; I had childhood onset schizo/ psychotic bi-polar, it let me actually complete CBT and CSC treatments. Lithium carbonate was found to have an effect on mania and depression by John Cade during uric acid experiments. He noticed the guinea pigs had calmed down after injection, so basically it was discovered by total accident. People with mania naturally have cocaine levels of dopamine in their system, so anti-psychotics work by reducing dopamine. They are still unsure of why lithium works.",
                "First of all, they're not diseases, they're disorders. A psychological disorder is simply a label we give certain personality traits to help us know the best way to treat them. All the treatments we give people for certain mental disorders are simply because they've shown positive results in the past. \n\nThe reason we don't know what causes these is the same reason we don't know why some people prefer basketball over football.",
                "Bipolar and Schizophrenia have drugs that help with the symptoms of these illnesses, but do not cure them.  In fact as the years have gone by many of the older drugs like Lithium are being used less and less in a lot of cases because they aren't as well tolerated or effective as once thought.  Honestly these illnesses have not had enough money and source funding for finding any better replacement medications or alternative treatments just as with other brain illnesses.  Mental illness is low on the totem pole when it comes to Government funding and or Charity.  But in answer to your question they are just using these various medications like Seroquel for example to mainly treat symptoms.  I have someone in my family (actually two people) one has severe Schizophrenia and the other has Bipolar Type I.  It is amazing how these illnesses do in fact run in families.  Which leads me to believe there is indeed a heavy linkage \"gene wise\" that runs in the blood lines of families.  Most people think that just taking the medications alone is enough or that somehow it is a cure all, but it really isn't.  These medications need constant tweaking over the years, and they cause serious side effects like Diabetes, Tremors, PVC's of the heart, Huge weight gain etc.  A person must be constantly monitored while on these types of medications.  Most people with Bipolar lose their creativeness and become very blunted emotionally while on these meds.  That is why so many people with Bipolar don't like taking these medications.  I also have seen in my family where **ongoing psychiatric counseling and talk/cognitive therapy is needed life long.**  So medications alone are not enough.  Learning to recognize 'triggers\" and emotional waves is very important and understanding ones own illness and how to interact with others on a day to day basis.  Learning how to manage change and crisis is also very important.  The other thing I would like to mention is if you are a family with someone that suffers from these brain illnesses, you as a family should invest life long counseling for yourself.  Learning how to manage a loved one with these illnesses is just as important as them taking their meds and going to therapy.  It isn't a one way street where all the onus is up to the person with the illness.  Anyway, we are so behind right now on trying to find real answers and cures for these brain illnesses.  I use to have to work with co-workers whom I recognized very Bipolar like behavior that made it really hard to deal with them in the office.  Most people with untreated Bipolar and or Schizophrenia have a hard time keeping a job since their perceptions are askew and not the norm.  Hope my answer helped a little.",
                "Trial and error. \n\nHad a Dr explain to me: we really don't understand most mental health disorders or the drugs we use to treat them. But we do know that certain drugs exhibit a range of effects and side effects. So we try to start by matching drugs with likely positive effects and the most benign side effects. If that doesn't work, we try to understand what effect the drug *did* have, and based on that, we'll keep trying other drugs, each time risking different side effects. If we find something that works, we'll stop there. ",

                "The sad truth is that in many cases those drugs do little to acctually _help_ those dianosed with schizophrenia. In fact, the long-term outcomes literature for antipsychotics, which has been compiled over a period of nearly 50 years, consistently tells of drugs that increase the likelihood that a person diagnosed with schizophrenia will become chronically ill. \n\nIt seems paradoxical that drugs that ameliorate acute psychotic symptoms over the short term will increase the likelihood that a person so treated will fare poorly over the long term. But that disturbing fact showed up in the very first outcome studies, and has continued to show up ever since.\n\nSee Robert Whitaker's book, \"Anatomy of an Epidemic\" for a troubling and intellegent investigation into the history of psychiatric medications and why they are possibly fueling the quickly increasing rate of mental disability in America.\n\n[Here's a link](_URL_0_) to many scientific articles relating specifically to schizophrenia.\n\n",
                "You have heard that correlation does not imply causation? Well, we don't know the cause but we do observe a correlation between drug administration and symptom relief.

                "Drugs aren't necessarily designed and based on a deep understanding of an illness and why it causes what it causes in a person. They're often just discovered serendipitously. We're more like tinkerers with drugs than engineers. If it works, it works (or it doesn't, or it does more than intended... ). This is evident in the fact that there is a lot of research into WHY drugs work in the way that they do.",
                "Maybe you've heard of Abilify (aripiprazole). It's a antipsychotic meant for treating disorders such as schizophrenia and depression. However somewhere around ... Probably a little less than 10 years ago doctors found that it was also quite effective at treating tic disorders like Tourette's.\n\nIt's still not really understood why it works and in what cases it works. The layman explanation is that dopamine is a tricky thing. Neurologists and chemists still aren't sure just exactly how far the effects of dopamine levels cascade throughout the body, but have found that raising or decreasing its levels are helpful to some disorders. Similarly they find that there are trends in dopamine levels between those with common disorders.\n\nReally, chemical pathways in the brain are just weird.",
                "To say that we don't know what the brain is actually doing is inaccurate. For pretty much any neurological disorder, we have a pretty good understanding of the pathways. For instance, schizophrenia is generally caused by a mutation in the dopaminergic pathways. (over-reactive D2 receptors I think?). \n\nDrugs can be developed to also target these pathways so a drug treating schizophrenia will target the same D2 receptors, perhaps as an antagonist of the receptor or a channel blocker. \n\nAny possible drug treatment undergoes vigrous scrutiny until it is FDA approved.  They are generally tested on transgenic mice which mimic symptoms of the disease. Note that they can only mimic these diseases as a lot of neurological diseases are only seen in higher primates (so Alzheimer's disease uses a 3xTg-AD mice (3 times genetically modified mosue to model Alzheimers).\n\nI apologise if any of this is inaccurate. I'm currently in my third year of studying neuroscience and I did a second year project on Modelling AD with Transgenic mice. Schizophrenia is not my strong point but I believe what I'm saying is reliable. Hope this helps.",
                "Those drugs treat symptoms of the illness. There is no drug that cures a person of schizophrenia. There are drugs that help reduce or eliminate voices and hallucinations, but none that make the voices permanently. There are drugs that minimize physical symptoms of anxiety and panic, but none that can eliminate the root disorder. I'm a mental health worker myself, and we emphasize integrated treatment. Drugs help with symptoms, counselors and therapists help with cognitive therapies."

There have actually been some pretty good attempts at mechanical human hands, but trying to make a soft fleshy part out of rigid components is never going to be exact. We can use tiny motors to control the wrists and fingers, but then you end up with awkward heaviness wherever the motors are sitting. You can put tactile sensors to detect finger touches, or encoders to keep track of joint positions, but with current tech you cant get enough accuracy to identify the shape or texture of an object you're holding, how hard your grip is, is the object warm, is it slipping from your grasp,  etc. Is the hand waterproof? Does it sweat to cool itself? If we are really going for an \"exact copy\" we are a long way off.\n\nMy research is is in what we call \"soft robotics.\" In general, we try to replicate some of the functions of living tissue in such a way that the final product is soft, flexible, stretchable, damage resistant, and so on. We try to develop parts so that all the functionality you need is just built into the material itself.  I mean, think of all the things just your skin does. Instead of motors we develop artificial muscles out of different materials so they can be made into bundles of controllable filament. Instead of copper wires we use conductive fabric or liquid metal in tiny tubes.  Instead of ratchets and mechanical stops, we use stiffening and softening fibers to hold the grip in place.

                "In Western Europe, around the time of the Roman empire. Roman pottery production was generally industrial and for-profit in factories, in contrast with preceding household pottery production. The effect of this was that wheel-thrown pottery won over hand-formed (coiled) pottery. The fast potter's wheel allows for thinner forms, but also requires more technology (investment) and a specific supple type of clay, rather than just any clay. It also meant that because pottery was made for-profit by competing companies, esthetics became a bigger part of pottery production, as well as standardisation. Coupled with the display function of drinking parties of the time (both in Roman and barbaric societies), this led to the introduction of the drinking cup in various forms, including glassware, in western Europe. As the Rhineland (the primary pottery production center in late antiquity) retained its prominence during the early middle ages, the collapse of the Roman empire had relatively little effect on the rise of the cup.\n\nI am not so sure what happens in the eastern empire though; both 'nice' pottery and factory production were already part of the pre-Roman eastern Mediterranean, but in the Greek-influenced world people were drinking from shallow bowls as well as cups. This may have to do with the dregs in wine which was drank here, people basically using their bowls as shallow pans like a gold-panner would. Note however that the shallow kylix is only one of the many pottery forms from which one could drink, others being much more cup-like."

                "The Seleucid state was for the longest time the largest of the successor kingdoms, controlling the heart of the former Achaemenid Empire and many of the world's most affluent regions at that time. Despite that its memory in western Europe, when indeed it is remembered at all, is frequently one of precipitous, inevitable decline, and it's often regarded as nothing more than a curiousity. I'm glad that you've asked this question because it's an opportunity to talk about the Empire itself whilst also examining its memory in historiography, the traces of which lie beneath the question you've asked.\n\nThe Seleucid state is a fascinating creation, but many facets of the Empire pointed at to indicate the seeds of its decline are not unique to the Seleucids. The Empire was not especially sprawling compared to the Achaemenid Empire, and the Seleucids inherited a robust network of bureaucracy and infrastructure designed to govern and maintain order across its diverse provinces. Aramaic bureaucracy was maintained but gave way to a Greek speaking one over time, even in the farthest reaches of the Empire such as the province of Bactria. Nor would one say that it had especially venomous or frought dynastic politics compared to the Achaemenids who came before, who had fought several internal civil wars across their two centuries of existence, or indeed the Neo-Assyrian Empire which also saw civil wars between members of the royal family for possession of the throne.\n\nThere is also a persistent idea that Greeks and Macedonians were especially unwelcome to Near Eastern peoples for various reasons, leading to a deep rejection of Greek culture and rulership. Whilst the Achaemenids had pedigree in the Near East, with Persia functioning as the successor to the Kingdom of Elam, they had been just as foreign to most of their conquered subjects as the Greeks had been, happy to absorb those traditions that would lead to stable rulership but otherwise clearly marked as foreign and at times privileged above other peoples within the Empire. Nor am I arguing simply on the basis of likelihoods- it's quite evident from material culture alone that, far from rejecting Seleucid interpretations of Greek culture, the Parthians absorbed many of them wholesale and this formed a strand in Near Eastern material culture.\n\nIf anything we also need to think about why this is a monumental decline, when the Achaemenid supremacy over Middle Eurasia was broken across a single decade by a former client state that was having to maintain a logistics chain across the Hellespont and, eventually, the whole of Anatolia. If anything the overnight reversal of uncontested might into total submission to a hostile power is more shocking than a gradual loss of territory, prestige, and military power.\n\nHowever, there were issues unique to the Seleucids that had not been the case for the Achaemenids, and this definitely relates to why the Seleucids lost their power bit by bit instead of, as with the Achaemenids and Neo-Assyrian Empires, being utterly vanquished at what seemed to be the height of their powers.\n\nFor one thing, the Seleucids were never actually in control of their homelands for the entirety of the Empire's existence. This resulted in the mass import of Hellenic colonists across the Empire to form citizen populations, often at times for entirely new cities. This afforded the Seleucids quite a lot of power; not only did they often have garrisons in important cities, as the Achaemenids had done, there was often a theoretically loyal population of fellow Greeks who would often dominate the local economy. This settlement was especially dense in the area we call Syria, which is why that was the element of the Seleucid state which survived the longest, and this was eventually the ideological 'homeland' of the dynasty and its Greek populations rather than Macedonia and Hellas. However, this did mean that there was the possibility for socio-economic tension in these cities, and the roving nature of the Seleucid monarch meant that these individual cities had a lot more power than it might otherwise seem. The frequency of campaigns and the fact that the King was constantly moving from place to place meant that cities had to be relied upon for logistics and provender, and these needs were not always met (though the consequences for such defiance were usually severe).\n\nThis is itself symptomatic of perhaps the biggest difference between the Achaemenids and Seleucids; the Seleucids had peers. The Achaemenids never possessed a neighbouring power that could be said to contest their might or rival their amibitions, and when an exception came in the form of Phillip II and Alexander III of Macedon the result was the wholesale replacement of the Achaemenid monarch on top of the intact structures of the Empire, with Alexander even marrying into the dynasty. By contrast the Seleucids faced a number of other successor states that could not simply be overwhelmed or overawed. Military threats to the Seleucid border, particularly in the west, were organised. The fact that there were competing powers in the Mediterranean also gave scope for marginal territories and cities to comparison shop, flitting between allegiances to get the best deals on offer. Dealing with this whilst also dealing with a geographically sprawling Empire was not easy. The Achaemenids had themselves struggled with some of the Empire's marginal areas, particularly in the Aegean and in Egypt, the latter of which successfully revolted against the Achaemenids twice. For the Seleucids they began to struggle with Central Asia, precisely because this area was not a source of constant threats.\n\nAttempts to reassert authority in Central Asia, such as Antiochus III's campaign into Bactria, were lengthy and involved the King's person, which took him away from matters involving the other hostile successor states and cost considerable resources. This was not dissimilar to Xerxes' expedition to Greece, where he eventually had to leave and the attempt to secure a Greek satrapy collapsed not long afterwards, except that Xerxes had been attempting to push the limits of the Empire's authority and Antiochus III had been attempting to reassert his Empire's existing integrity.\n\nThe Seleucids were also existing in a larger world. When Alexander had launched his expedition against the Achaemenids they had been content to maintain an Indus frontier, with no evidence really existing that serious attempts were made to conquer further into India. Within a few decades the Mauryan Empire would come into existence, uniting most of the subcontinent and potent enough that the Seleucids, at arguably the height of their powers, were willing to part with eastern territories rather than waste time and energy in protracted warfare. Considering the stability of the Seleucid/Mauryan frontier afterwards this choice seems to have been vindicated.\n\nWe also have the elephant in the room that is the Roman Empire, growing from a regional Italian power to one of the Mediterranean heavyweights to the uncontested owner of the Western Mediterranean. The Roman Empire's decision to expand its sphere of interest to include Greece and the Aegean, and then the entire Eastern Mediterranean, denied any possibility of a belated Seleucid conquest of Macedonia or Greece, along with the possibility of a final overthrow of Ptolemaic Egypt. These gave a kind of half life to the Empire's existence, unable to overcome obstacles to its power in the west even after great efforts, with many of its former client states and breakway territories turning to Rome as the new game in town, and with its pretensions to military supremacy and independent foreign policy broken at the hands of Rome. Dynastic squabbles concerned ever smaller versions of the Empire as former satrapies asserted independence or went to Rome. Likewise its neglect in Central Asia had allowed the Parthians to go from a minor kingdom to an expanding power that had pushed the Seleucids out of the Iranian Plateau entirely. The last serious attempts the Seleucid dynasty made to assert themselves were the final campaigns aimed to defend Mesopotamia from the Parthians, which ultimately failed, dooming the remnants of the dynasty to fight over increasingly splintered parcels of the Empire's heartland in Syria.\n\nA glib summary might point to the Seleucids as the victims of socio-economic change, as new centralised states emerged where previously the Near East could likely have written off the locals as barbarians barely capable of living in stone houses, or indeed that they were victims of the beast that Alexander unleashed; the idea that any scrappy but organised smaller state could take on the Mighty Empire and win it all. But realistically, given Seleucus' origins as a talented but also lucky grandee of Alexander's military circle, who had overcome any number of similar men to even create his Empire, they did a pretty good job at being a functional Near Eastern Empire. The fact that they were not able to eliminate their close rivals and had similar origins and motivations to them is probably the biggest specific structural flaw built into the Seleucids from the beginning; it's hard to make yourself seem quite as scary as the Achaemenid monarch, uncontested Emperor from Sardis to Samarkhand, when you *are* contested and when you know the King of Egypt, King of Macedon, King of Pergamon among many others have exactly the same origin you do; a Macedonian warlord with ambition and endurance. But the fact that they are considered so symptomatic of decline, so weak and ineffectual, is primarily a result of hostile Roman historiography and 19th-20th century imperial ideology that characterised them as effete, sensuous, and oriental, especially as a dynasty that mixed with Asian peoples in marriage and government. The study of the Seleucids has moved on from that idea, it's just rather taking a while to catch on."

                " >  Can astronauts use their cell phones to make calls or text?\n\nThe International Space Station does have internet access. They can make calls or text over the internet/Wi-Fi (like Wi-Fi calling, Facetime, or Skype does), but they can't make a \"normal\" phone call because there are no cell towers. I don't know if they can just use it whenever they want since bandwidth would be limited and probably must be kept free most of the time for official business.\n\n >  Isn’t all that information going from a cell tower, to a satellite?\n\nNo, your phone connects to a cell tower, and then there are cables and wires connected to the cell tower that your data moves through. Neither you nor the cell towers connect to a satellite.\n\n",
                "It depends on what you mean by \"cell phone\". If you mean the phone you have in your hands right now, it is highly unlikely that it would work in space. \n\nOur consumer cell phones look for nearby cell networks, which then connect to a nearby cell tower. Neither cell networks or cell towers exist in space, so these kinds of cell phones won't work. And the range for these types of cell phones is only 5-10 miles, because they use directional radio waves to travel horizontally.\n\nIf you mean a satellite phone, which connects directly to satellites in orbit, then yeah. They could almost definitely make a phone call with them, depending on where they were in relation to those satellites. See, those satellites use directional signals that point straight down at the Earth, so if you were between the Earth and those satellites, it would work just fine. You could do it near the ISS, for example. \n\nAnd as you move further away from the Earth, they would stop working again, because they would quite quickly leave the maximum range for those types of communications.\n\nThe ISS, for reference, uses VoIP from their internet connection.\nAnd, for goodness sakes, don't dial the wrong number. Imagine the long distance charge! /badjoke\n\nEDIT: Oh, and that's just kind of ignoring the physical problems that would occur due to temperature, pressure, radiation, or magnetism.

In the areas around Earth, the temperatures can range from 240F to -150F, far too hot/cold for sensitive electronics.",

The cost of running a constellation of satellites makes satellite phones very expensive (source: knew a guy who did collections for a satphone company).\n\nThe ISS, contrarily, switches from ground station to ground station. Their ground stations are large, and do nothing but follow the space station.

Satellites are not used at all for cell phone networks.  If they were, internet on your phone would be a **lot** slower.  Satellite internet is really only used in places **way** out in the sticks where it's just too expensive to run cables for the few people that live there.  It's slow and shitty.  Even though radio waves travel at the speed of light, it's an incredibly long distance for a signal to get up to a satellite and back down.  \n\nCell towers have cables connecting them to wired networks, fairly similar to how a home internet connection works.  \n\nA related fun fact, the vast vast majority of internet traffic going between continents does not use satellites either.  For the same reason, it's really slow. The internet actually depends on big fancy expensive underwater cables that have been set up to cross oceans.    We've been putting underwater cables across oceans for over 150 years now.  The earliest ones were for telegraph and then telephone and at this point we have far more advanced ones for internet. \n\n_URL_0_",

The speed of light is very fast, but still takes over half a second for data to bounce off a geosynch orbit satellite and back.  That's why satellite interviews and phone calls have such an obvious lag.  \n\n\nThe vast majority of internet, text, and phone traffic goes over cables in the ground and under the ocean, which can get data from point to point 10x as fast as satellites, at hundreds or thousands of times the bandwidth.  Satellite is usually only used as a fallback plan for remote areas where the sender/receiver isn't in range of a normal network.",

Our atmosphere shields us from alot of that.\n\nNormal electronics have a high failure rate when put in space because chips and other components are not radiation hardened, and tend to have problems. Integrated circuits can, and routinely do fail due to radiation damage of the particular circuit because the transistors are so small. Radiation can easily induce a current in an improper manner, and destroy handfuls of transistors (which effectively make the entire integrated circuit dead). \n\nJust figured I'd mention this aspect. ",
                "Using normal cell connections can be a problem when you're higher up, for a couple reasons. \n\nNumber one, depending on how high up you are, you may have great signal strength because of less blocking your signal (no other buildings, hills, etc like on earth), but you may end up with having issues with being able to connect to too many towers at once, and difficulty in locking to one quickly.\n\nNumber two, unless you are in geosynchronous orbit, you're going very fast, and you may move out of range of a tower before you can really do much, so you'd be extremely rapidly switching towers.",

Many cell phones receive data from GPS satellites, but that data is very limited and is only used by the phone to triangulate its own position on or near the earth's surface.\n\nThere are actual satellite phones that are intended for use outside of normal cell phone networks.  Those phones require a fairly clear line of sight to specific satellite(s) intended for that sort of communication.  \n\nI do not know if that sort of satellite communication is used in space for voice calls; in general, communication satellites are still limited in processing power (even simple relaying) due to size and weight limits for efficiently placing the satellite into orbit.

A cell phone antenna (technically, its signal processor) is designed to run cell tower frequencies, it cannot run at the lower and higher band frequencies utilized by satellites. This is first due to size and manufacturing restrictions (more versatile transceivers and chips cost more to produce and necessarily increase chip size); second, laws are in place which define what frequencies satellites, phones, and any wireless device uses. \n\nIn otherwords, even if cell towers bounced signals off of satellites (they don't, but I'll get to that shortly), a cell phone would not work in space as the signal bands used by satellites and those used by cell phones are nowhere near identical. \n\nAs others have pointed out, cell towers do not use satellites to route signals. There are two reasons and a few bits of minutia which explain this. First, pretty much the entire world (geographically speaking, not individually) is connected by hardline (usually fibre); it is far more efficient to use hardline for data as it is hardline that connects 99.999% of the servers and data sources we care about to our wifi routers and computers. Those areas which do not have hardline usually have long distance, directionalized (focused instead of radial) repeaters for higher frequency data (higher frequency = more data speed). Very few places rely on satellite internet and those which do are very small and geographically isolated communities. \n\nThe second reason is speed. As alluded to above, high frequency bands provide data with more \"bandwidth\" which is colloquially synonymous with data speed. But, the problem with most high frequency bands are their small wave lengths, which are easily scattered by stuff in the atmosphere (clouds, moisture, et cetera). This leads to noise and signal loss which would prevent an efficient and uninterrupted flow of data. Also, differences in atmospheric composition and density refract high frequency signals (radio is just light afterall) much more percipitously than low frequency signals with longer wavelengths. Overall, this makes satellite very very limited in terms of data speed. \n\nThe other third reason, which I have caste as manutia since it deals with a bit of internet most people dont think about, is latency. Latency is, simply put, the round trip time between sending a message and getting a response, assuming a response is sent immediately after the recipient receives it. Light can only move so fast, with signals sent over fiberoptic cable and signals directed with satellites having negligible differences in speed (light does travel slightly slower in medium than it does in vacuum). Even with slightly faster light, satellites yield far longer latency (2-3s) than hardline (30-300ms). The main two factors here have to do with signal path distance and intermediary signal processing. \n\nTo send a signal into space and move it around the globe will inevitably, for most use cases, lead to a longer distance of travel than simply running the signal along the curvature of the ground inside hardline. You're adding a few hundred km, at each ground to space and space to ground leg of the journey (4 legs in total) which can quickly add thousands of kilometers of extra travel distance between transceivers alone. The difference in speed is so negligable that the ground based hardline will almost always outrun the space fairing signal. \n\nThe other bit slowing this data down are the ground and space transceivers themselves. For the most part, space hardware is 10 years behind ground tech (at the time of launch) because the conditions of space are so harsh that new tech needs a decade or longer to certify for space. This means data is bottle necked at each leg of it's journey by slower routing technology, which may take longer to reconstruct a packet and then longer still deciding where to aim it or what frequency to repeat it on. The ground based transceivers are likewise a few years behind the mainstream as their data needs are pretty consistent over longer periods of time than say a cell tower. This yields yet another bottle neck in the journey. \n\nThe ISS is connected to the internet via earth, not other satellites. They have regular periods during which their internet is down and cannot log on to their Facebook or forward experiment data to the ground. They still have their radio, just like a plane, and can talk to Houston and Moscow, but again, those are two very different types of signals communicated with two entirely different radio bands. A voice signal caries far less data (in fact, it is probably analog, so no digital signals at all) and can operate at far lower (and more stable and versatile) frequencies than the iss data antennas use. For reference, those huge satellite dishes some people still have on their roof or in their backyard (d-band) are able to maintain signal in even the thickest part of a hurricane, when most dish network and direct tv dishes have long since cut out. Those dishes are big, not simply to get a better signal, but because the signals they collect have much longer wavelengths. That longer wavelength helps the information penetrate even the worst atmospheric conditions with minimal loss. Such is the case with radio communications on the ISS, which are almost invariably up and running, even when data links are down. \n\nTL;DR: satallites are slow and expensive, almost none of the internet is connected to them, and cell phones cant talk to them even if they wanted to. The iss depends on normal radio for most mission critical comms and even up there, internet is a luxury that is regularly down. The iss connects to the internet via the ground, not other satellites.

                "Obviously \"miracle worker\" is going to be a tough thing to prove historically, but I assume you're not asking about the historicity of Jesus' miracles or any other \"miracle workers\" of the time, and you're just asking if there are any other people around that time who had miracles attributed to them.\n\nThe answer is yes, but a more interesting thing to point out is that Jesus wasn't even the only miracle worker/contender to being messiah *referenced in the Bible.* The Bible has both Herod, and John the Baptist as characters in the narrative of Jesus, and both men were claimed by people to be the messiah/workers of miracles. \n\nHerod was famous because he was king, and built the Second Temple. That the messiah would be a king, or at least of the line of a king, was pretty much accepted by Pharisees and Sadducees alike (I don't know about the Essenes). In addition, his rebuilding of the temple was seen by many as a miracle, AND was one of the things many Jewish people took to be a sign that the messiah had either arrived or was near. \n\nJohn the Baptist was had a ministry not unlike that of Jesus, going around baptizing people in water, and many of those people would allegedly report spiritual experiences (at least in the Bible). The Bible also tells us that Herod had John the Baptist killed, and, in one narrative, that he was worried about having killed him because he believed John the Baptist actually *was* the messiah. \n\nI really recommend the first part of *[Christianity and Rabbinic Judaism](_URL_0_)* for the situation in Roman occupied Palestine around that time, and the varying claims to divinity in the region. John the Baptist and Herod weren't the only messiah contenders, just the only two to earn a mention in the Bible.\n\nAs to the second part of your question about legacy, it's hard to say. Neither Herod nor John the Baptist had a resurrection story floating around after their deaths, and Peter, Paul, and the other apostles were *really* good at spreading Jesus' story around, so that can account for part of it. That the Roman Empire eventually accepted Christianity and not some other movement born at the same time period certainly impacted the legacy of Jesus in the west after that point, but I don't think anyone can definitively point to one reason why Jesus' legacy is so prolific and the other messiah-contenders of the time faded to obscurity.

                "Others will be better positioned to comment on the military aspect of your question, but it's simply not correct to suggest that Poland was less badly affected by the Black Death than other parts of Europe.\n\nI go into considerable detail about this [in a lengthy series of posts here](_URL_0_), but the bottom line is that the impact of the 1347-50 pandemic on Poland is unknowable, but was very likely greater than is generally thought, while there is no doubt that the country was very badly affected by a second outbreak of the disease that began in 1360. Overall, the best guess we can make, given the limitations of the sources, is that Poland was probably just as badly affected by plague in the second half of the 14th century as a whole as were the states of western Europe.\n\nAs for the lands further to the east – both Livonia and Lithuania – unfortunately practically nothing is known of how the Black Death impacted them. We know the pandemic hit Prussia from August 1349, and reached Livonia by 1351; Benedictow lists some of the towns where it is known to have raged, but again nothing resembling secure mortality rates can be extrapolated for Prussian territory.\n\nThe economic picture, while also murky, is just a little clearer. By increasing opportunities for the survivors at home, the Black Death does seem to have significantly limited what had been quite a substantial flow of emigrants to the territories to the east. Moreover, it's not unreasonable to suppose that the pandemic also lessened demand for wheat, which was the major export of the territories controlled by the Teutonic Knights. No figures survive to give us details. Neither the *Cambridge Economic History of Europe* nor Urban's military history deal with the problem in detail; the Cambridge volume states that it's scarcely possible to. A'Barrow, in his recent general work, does list economic problems among the reasons he gives for the decline in the order's fortunes from c.1400, though it is not at all clear that he has either done any significant analysis of the problem, or based his passage on any study that has, so this claim may be little more than another of the unproved assumptions that have long, uh, plagued this field.\n\nThe only other thing worth adding to this rather bleak picture is that, while Grunwald/Tannenberg was fought at a late date relative to all this (1410), population figures were a long way from recovering from the impact of the plague even then. The best estimates from the territories to the west where we have more detailed records suggest that, in England, for example, population peaked at somewhere between 4.5 - 5.75m in c.1345 and was still in the range of 2 - 2.5m in 1410.\n\n**Sources**\n\nStephen A'Barrow, *Death of a Nation: A New History of Germany* (2016)\n\nOle J Benedictow, *The Black Death, 1346-1353: The Complete History* (2004)\n\nMarian Malowist, \"The trade of Eastern Europe in the Later Middle Ages,\" in Postan and Miller (eds), *The Cambridge Economic History of Europe II: Trade and Industry in the Middle Ages* (1987)\n\nWilliam Urban, *The Teutonic Knights: A Military History* (2003)"

It's usually easy for them to take a huge bite out of something like that and from what I understand, when they make a mistake and attack a human (with the dense, weight-bearing long bones and no fat), they're as surprised as the human.\n\n\nWhat a crocodile usually gets first is a snout or a leg of some animal and then they have to pull it into the water and drown it.",
                "Think of how the force is being applied. A great white is swimming at high velocity and striking, cutting and ripping. The jaw may only have 800 lbs of force, but that 800lbs is already at the front of a truck.\n\nAlso, they want their prey to weaken, to bleed out and die and are okay with making multiple attacks. They can follow the blood trail to find it again.\n\nCrocs can't really chase their prey effectively. They are an aquatic animal preying on land animals. They need to abmush, to get dinner on the first try, and not have to chase the wounded animal onto land.\n\nSharks and crocs are two of the oldest examples of top predators that have gone virtually unchanged  for the longest periods of time. Great white body form is over 400 million years old. If more force conveyed an evolutionary advantage,  it would have happened during that period. Crocs aren't as old, but they are basically dinosaurs as far as preserved evolutionary structure is concerned. If they could spend less energy on bite strength, it would convey an advantage in their environment and it would have evolved over the last 40 million or so years.",
                "think of their teeth and mouths. A crocodiles mouth is like a bear trap, small spike like teeth closing fast and not letting go so it can drag you under water. A sharks mouth is more like a mouth of daggers that can chomp clean through things with the multitude of razor sharp blades.",
                "What makes you say a great white is only 800 lbs? Obviously it varies according to size of the specimen, but most current evidence is that large great whites can do thousands of pounds. \n\nSee: _URL_0_\n\n",
                "Great White teeth are meant to cut, thats why they can bite things in half. Crocodile teeth are meant to lock, hence the reason why their jaws slam shut with tremendous force, but aren't very good at opening. This is why people can hold a crocs mouth shut, because they are designed to grab and tear flesh.",
                "It's because of how they bite not their bite force. A shark especially a great white bites down and shakes side to side. The teeth have a serrated edge and therefore effectively saw through their prey while a crocodile bites down (sometimes death roll but not always). Pretty simple. The shark saws through flesh making jagged massive lacerations while the crocodile just creates puncture wounds",
                "It's all in the teeth. Sharks have teeth that are designed for cutting and tearing. They're serrated like a steak knife and do much the same. Sharks don't always get the chunk in one bite, they do have to bite more than once sometimes. \n\nCrocodiles have teeth designed for holding.  They're teeth a smooth but very pointed, so they don't cause as much damage when they enter flesh. Instead of biting off chunks to eat they drown the prey and tear smaller bits off my grabbing hold and rolling to tear away the meat. As for bones, they do get broken but it helps when the croc grabs at the right angle. ",
                "In evolutionary biology the main lesson learned is that selective pressure is placed upon organisms for successful procreation. In the case of crocs, they are fighting boney creatures that can escape them. So their bite is a trap. They do crush bones and have a death roll to help them. \nSharks, on the other hand, have teeth like knives where the slice chunks and can even project their jaws outward to snatch up prey. \n\nThey have different mechanisms and different approaches. Any videos you have seen where something survives is sheer luck. The crocs can't chew or cut through things, but make no mistake, they crush bones and rend flesh. \n\n_URL_1_  _URL_0_"

                "My area of research deals almost exclusively to the Denver area. But I feel that the information I can share will shed at least some light on your question. Other Historians will likely be able to add more information than I provide here. The main sources I refer to here that deal with this subject are: 'Chinese emmigration into the United States 1850-1880' by Kil Young Zo, 'The Growth and Decline of Chinese Communities in the Rocky Mountain Region' by Rose Hum Lee, 'The Chinese In Colorado' by Gerald Rudolph, 'Asians in Colorado' by William Wei, and 'The Road to Chinese Exclusion: The Denver Riot,1880 Election and Rise of the West' by Liping Zhu. I also have read countless newspaper articles documenting early Pioneer Asian experiences and people.  \n\nAs you had mentioned in your question, California passed anti Chinese laws starting in the early 1850s. Europans  that had come to California had always looked at Asian pioneers with suspicion due to the vast differences in language and spiritual beliefs, but it was the labor issues that politicians used to champion the legal need for  exclusion. When a law was passed in California that barred an Asian person from testifying in court, and therefore preventing them from having any legal protection or defending themselves in the court, they started to travel deeper into the country in high numbers. It appears as though about 35,000 were moving North, North East, and East in the mid 1850s. They were dotted throughout the Rocky Mountains with small camps for placer mining and small Corrals set up to offer goods to people headed to California.  In the 1860s, with more Asians coming into the Country and the huge demand for labor in the new transcontinental railroad, labor tensions increased when Asians filled some of that need. Also their Community had grown bigger and stronger despite the outragous ordinances. The groups that would eventually become the \"Chinese Six Companies\"  had already formed and were growing in strength. In the Rockies European miners were running into Chinese miners (though they might have seen that the other way around) and prospectors would clash. By 1870, with the Continental Railroad completed, limited mining oportunities, and the conclusion of a bloody war over slavery, the competition for employment was high all over the country. From  California in the 1850s to the West in the 1860s, to throughout the Country during the 1870s, the call the \"Chinese must go\" was getting louder, and violent clashes escalated. The main complaint was that the Chinese were taking jobs that Europeans felt only Europans should have;  this sentiment was accompanied by accusations of \"heathenism\" (\"satanism\"  would be a proper modern day interperetation) and seduction of European youth and women through opium. Throughout this time the newspapers contain various stories of outrageous enequality shown to the Chinese pioneers, on one occasion a Chinese man is arrested for physically defending himself and in another \"boys\" shoot a Chinese man for fun and there is no repercussions whatsoever. During the 1870s in Colorado, there was an actual call for Asians to come to the Territory; here, railroads still needed building and mines still needed mining. Throughout the 70s our Asian population grew, holidays were shared together (Apparently Chinese New Year in lower downtown Denver was AWESOME), they traded with each other, Asians dominated the laundry business and the Asian community was credited with being one of the pillars of the gate to Colorado statehood. They were even encouraged to build a giant Joss house, which they did and its ruins still stand. They had their own towns in the mountains and worked  thier own claims, Children were born and families begun. \n\nThen came the election of 1880, the Anti Chinese position became a major topic and throughout 1880 the tone in Denver drastically changed. The Rocky Mountain News started printing virilunt articles about the Denver Chinese and by October Chinese in Denver were telling friends in other areas not to come here. Although both candidates were against immigration, Garfield was painted as being friendly to the Chinese.His rival, Hancock, had a campaign going from town to town with rallys and chants: \" The Chinese Must Go\". The month before the election a letter was \"found\" that \"proved\" Garfield was planning on recruiting Chinese labor that would take jobs away from Europeans. The letter was a fake, but it wasnt proven immidiately and rumors that the Chinese were going to swarm the country spread like wildfire. The week of the election there was a rally by torchlight in Denver and tension was at an all time high. the day after the rally a riot broke out in Denver that was decried across the nation. Garfield won the election but was assasinated the following year. During the time between the 1880 election and the exclusion act, the cry of \"the Chinese Must Go\" kept up, always with the same arguements about jobs, heathens, and opium. The Chinatown community in Denver was decimated. It did recover, but only to a certain extent.\n\n\nI hope some of that helped answer your question, and I am sure there is more that others can add but if you would like to know more about Asian history in Denver I recently started a website:\n\n_URL_0_\n\nI only have one post up so far, it is the account given by the Rocky Mountain News of the riot.  I added maps and pictures. My next posting will be soon and it will talk about the Joss house that was built and which you can see in one of the pictures in the riot article (\"Chinese headquarters\" with the blue flag). Also,one of the books I mentioned \"Chinese in Colorado\" by Gerald Rudolph is one that is super rare. you can only find it in a few select libraries and even then it has to stay on property. I made a PDF copy of the one thats held  in the western history reference section of the DPL and its available for download in the \"library\" section of my website. I hope to make pdf copies of Rose Hum Lee's and Kil Young Zo's  books available before New Year as they are rare as well.\n\nAgain, I hope I provided some worthwhile info, and if I can answer or clarify anything, please let me know."

The [Wikipedia Article](_URL_0_) on the topic is surprisingly good.  \n\nMy knowledge of the topic is largely based in radio interferometry, so I'll leave the answering of your second question to an expert in the field, hopefully.",
                "Yes, the [Large Binocular Telescope](_URL_2_) is an optical interferometer. Or at least it plans to be, I think they have that part working now. [COAST](_URL_0_) is another one.\n\nI believe the biggest problem to overcome is that in order for an interferometer to work properly, the wavefronts have to be kept in sync. This isn't so hard (relatively speaking, it's still an engineering miracle IMO) with radio telescopes based on how they're designed and that the wavelengths are longer, but it's really tough for optical telescopes. (see this page on [aperture synthesis interferometry](_URL_1_)). But it IS possible in the optical wavelengths.\n\nThe BIG plan would be to put a fleet of optical telescopes in space and link them up as an interferometer, like you said. Then you could use lasers to keep the armada in line and have a **giant** effective diameter optical telescope which would allow you to revolutionize pretty much every field of astronomy, including exoplanets.\n\nThe first step would be to prove a space based interferometer would work, and [SIM](_URL_3_) was that first step, where you just have 2 telescopes in one spacecraft, so you don't have to deal with lining up multiple satellites. It got canceled though, so we'll have to wait longer for a space-based interferometer.\n\nThis will be the future of optical observing eventually though... it just might take us 100+ years unless you all convince Congress to give NASA more money.\n",
                "Optical interferometry is definitely possible, but difficult. In order to have a fleet of space based telescopes working as a an optical inteferometer, you would have to know the location of each telescope to a fraction of the wavelength you are observing. This is very difficult to accomplish in practice because of the short wavelengths of optical or near infrared light. ",
                "This is a complex question.\n\nFirst off, the reason that extremely long baseline interferometry is workable with radio waves is because of the length of the wavelengths and their period, both of which are fairly large. Which makes it possible to perform interferometry virtually using recorded signals, all you need is to measure the signals well enough and to keep track of the base stations and the recorded signal with a spatial and temporal precision sufficiently greater than the wavelength/period of the signals themselves. Which, for radio wavelengths in the centimeter range and frequencies in the gigahertz range is actually achievable with current computing equipment, high precision atomic clocks, etc.\n\nAt optical wavelengths that sort of digitized signal interferometry is not even remotely feasible. We have no way of recording the phase of optical light photons at a precision of terahertz frequencies, nor a way of recording the positions of telescopes with sub micron resolution across such huge expanses.\n\nBut we can do interferometry with actual light beams, though it's still a significant challenge and hasn't proved nearly as advantageous as the use of interferometry in radio science."

Once the arc is established (either by progression from a glow discharge[10] or by momentarily touching the electrodes then separating them), increased current results in a lower voltage between the arc terminals. This negative resistance effect requires that some positive form of impedance (as an electrical ballast) be placed in the circuit to maintain a stable arc. This property is the reason uncontrolled electrical arcs in apparatus become so destructive, since once initiated, an arc will draw more and more current from a fixed-voltage supply until the apparatus is destroyed.\n\nIn this respect a plasma is totally different than a metal, which has positive resistance.",

People are subject to largely the same laws regardless of religion and using your religion as a justification for doing something illegal doesn't give you a pass.  There are examples that contradict this to an extent, but on a basic level starting a religion doesn't get you excused from the vast majority of federal laws.\n\nReligious freedom is more about your freedom to have belief without being prosecuted for simply having those beliefs.  But if those beliefs involve illegal practices and you move from believing in it to putting it into practice, then you are still usually breaking the law.\n\nEdit: Also, I'm not a law expert so I might be very wrong, but I believe that Native Americans living on a reservation have a greater amount of autonomy than you'll see anywhere else, so those are special circumstances.",
                " > the government must let them have an illegal substance due to religious rights\n\nThat is not true. Claiming that something is a religious ritual does not mean the government automatically has to let you do it. Those laws that make otherwise-illegal substances legal for religious use are carefully and specifically crafted for each individual drug/practice.\n\nIn fact the Supreme Court had ruled that peyote use was not protected under the American Indian Religious Freedom Act, which prompted Congress to pass amendments to the Act which specifically addressed peyote.",
                "I may be ignorant but I've never heard of native Americans using ayahuasca. That's usually a South American shaman sort of deal. I have heard of Native Americans using peyote in ceremonies tho. ",
                "I have friends who use Ayahuasca in the USA as part of their affiliation with a South American religion. They had to present to the Supreme court to prove their case, basically to prove they were a real religion and not just some folks wanting to trip out on drugs. They met for years in their ceremonies drinking only water, until their beloved Aya was given a green card. ",
                "The way the exemptions for illegal substances work for religious purposes is that your religion has to prove that the use of the substance is a vital part of a well established ritual. This is done on a case by case basis with any religion claiming use of a substance. You inventing a new religion would by definition not be well established and so would not be granted the exemption. And this is after you have gained religious status for your religion and move beyond being classified as a cult. "

                "The short answer is that accurate estimates of the numbers are hard to come by for just about any issue involving the US-Mexico border. This is in part due to the intense politicization it has received in the media and in the particular case of the 1930s repatriation, partially because it was not an official policy of the United States federal government.  As the wiki mentions, estimates vary widely based on who you talk to. [California](_URL_0_) estimated 2 million repatriations, which is on the very high side of estimates. *The Tarnished Golden Door: Civil Rights Issues in Immigration*, a report published by the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, estimated a quarter of that number, but with a similar estimate of the citizenship rate. \n\nIn fact, 50-60% is the typical range for all sources, but this hides a rather subtle issue: Almost everyone is deriving their numbers from the same few sources. These are *Decade of Betrayal* and *Unwanted Mexican Americans in the Great Depression*. Neither of these sources provide adequate sources for their numbers and in turn rely on media reports and local governments for their numbers. We simply don't know how many people were repatriated in the various programs. The general range we do know is that 1,000,000 people is likely a far overestimate and 300,000 people is likely an underestimate. Hoffman argues for 400,000-500,000. Mercedes Carreras de Velasco^1 argues for slightly more than 300,000, but restricts her work to a smaller time period. Alanís Enciso found numbers similar to Hoffman, but accounts for pre-campaign repatriations by discounting earlier years, resulting in a total estimate of 425,000. If we go by immigration policies in previous decades, we're limited to a mere 100,000 repatriations, well below even what the Mexican records indicate.\n\nThere isn't really a definitive way to answer your question. Half a million people may be slightly on the high side, but we know that it was likely more than a quarter of a million. We similarly don't know how many citizens were included in these numbers. On the low side, there might have been as few as 125,000 or on the high side, perhaps as many as 300,000. \n\n\n^1 *Los Mexicanos que devolvió la crisis 1929-1932*, Tlatelolco, 1974, pg. 65"

                "Overall, the soviets were actually very well equipped in 1941, with many of the war defining weapons already adopted and made in large numbers. Tanks such as the KV series, T-34, and thousands of inter-war period tankettes and scout tanks and armoured vehicles, a rather large number of semi-automatic rifles at a time when nearly all continental powers were entirely bolt-action based, a very large degree of motorization thanks in large part to licensed production with Ford through GAZ, effective and standardized artillery modules available in large numbers, and a large fairly modern airforce (for the time). Most of this equipment was well tested in the wars preceding Germanies invasion such as in Finland, the Spanish Civil War, and Khalkin Gol, and was already in the process of being modernized and replaced (such as the PPD-40 being decommisioned in '39, in favor of the simplified PPSH.) The Soviet economy was vertically planned from right after the end of the Russian civil war two decades before to beef up military capabilities and avoid the humiliating defeats Russia suffered in WW1 due to military backwardness. Not merely on paper, but materially the Soviet armed forces were at the time probably the most formidable in the world, and across the board plans were already in motion for further modernization in hand with the rapid military industrialization.\n\nWhat they crucially lacked however was not even leadership, but the ability to exercise it. Despite losing huge numbers of experienced officers in the Purge, there were still a good number of officers with lifetimes of leadership experience or natural talent such as Zhukov, Rossokovsky, and others. However, because of the purge, and the overriding climate of fear which was instilled by Stalin during this period, most of these talented officers were unable to exert much control over their actual commands, and caution and textbook leadership decisions prevailed. Orders were given rigidly from above regardless of understanding on the ground, and although sometimes this was actually beneficial in the cases of inexperienced new officers, in most cases the catastrophic losses in the first months of Barbarossa were direct results of these orders and allowed the more flexible German command structure to simply run circles around the static Russian positions.\n\nThe experience and training of the soldiers on the ground in '41, was probably on par with most nations at the time if even better because of the combat experience, albeit disastrous, which many soldiers would have recently had during the winter war. However, overall Soviet Military doctrine, even the nascent Deep Operations theory placed great emphasis on large scale movements, and offensive operations, possibly to the detriment of small, low level decision making and defensive experience, but there remained a legacy going back to Brusilov in WW1 in the Soviet military of specialized shock training for certain detachments, and in this way small unit tactics were still being honed. Soviet infantry were probably in general just as the rest of the military; well equipped, and experienced, but not well led. The thinking and theorizing was definitely there, but like everywhere else there were organizational catastrophes going on in the Army which prevented their realization in 41, which resulted in a great proportion of the most experienced soldiers being wiped out early on.\n\nBy 1943, the slow process of reorganizing the Military was beginning to bear fruit, and a leaner, far more experienced and even equipped infantrymen would be facing Germans. In later 41 and 42 the Soviets had thrown much of their complex military organizations, such as large independent tank divisions, out the window in favor of more manageable, yet large military structures, and the leadership and tactics at a lower level no doubt reflected these less complex structures as well. In 43 however, they began to return to the more intricate structures with smaller commands, and you would likely have begun to see smaller scale leadership improve as well. Deep Operations became the dogma again, and with it came a greater degree of autonomous delegation on the front-lines. In terms of equipment, the huge losses suffered in 41 had been overcome and things were turning around. Soviet production of small arms drastically outpaced that of the Germans in many key areas, notably automatic adoption. In 41, the emphasis for infantry equipment was a higher proportion of semi-automatic rifles such as the Tokarev SVT. By 1943 they decided to bypass this, and bolt actions were now paired with enormous amounts of submachine guns reaching the frontlines. Whereas the German war industries sought in every sphere to be masters, Soviet production had always emphasized doing one thing well, and doing a lot of it, though some things would remain woefully outdated.\n\nBy 1945, the differences in the these military philosophies had become even more stark. Whereas the average German soldier would still be using a bolt action rifle, and most likely not using motorized transport even this late, with a small number of far more elite troops using very advanced weapons and mechanized transport, the Soviets had continued to produce their tried and true equipment such as the PPSH, except in enormous quantities. It got to the point where entire infantry companies (~100-150 soldiers) would be entirely equipped with sub-machine guns, something uncommon even to the lavishly supplied US soldiers of the time, and producing devastating levels of firepower. Whereas in 41 and 42 very hastily trained Soviet soldiers flooded the ranks to stem the tide of the German onslaught, by 1945 the most hardened Soviet veterans remained, and they faced on average woefully inexperienced, under or overaged and infirm German adversaries. Another final change from 43 to 45 however would be that Lend-lease shipments began to affect things for the average infantry in earnest. Most notably Soviet soldiers motorization skyrocketed, and for once Soviet logistics were almost entirely freed from being tied down by the Rail-head."

                "The major, huge, totally devastating difference would be that electrically charged particles would necessarily be massless, or else the photon would have to be *massive*. If the left-handed and right-handed electron had different electric charges, then they could not 'combine' to form a single massive Dirac electron. (Only massless particles have definite chirality/handedness, but a particle must have a definite value of electric charge. More technically, a chiral U(1) interaction would forbid mass terms in the Lagrangian.) Massless electrons don't form bound states (atoms), so we'd be pretty much screwed.\n\nThe same problem happens for the weak interaction, by the way, but the resolution is different: instead of forcing particles to be massless, the weak interaction gets 'broken' by the Higgs mechanism which allows massive particles at the cost of massive gauge bosons (W and Z). The same could happen to the photon, in which case E & M would be a short-range interaction instead of long-range. In this case there are almost certainly major problems with the behavior of atoms, but the bigger problem is that stars would never form because collapsing gas clouds could never cool below the temperature corresponding to the photon mass (which would have to be almost as heavy as the electron!). (Gravitationally collapsing gas clouds need a light or massless particle to radiate off their energy, or else they stop collapsing.)"

Again, on average, you will find the molecule is closer to the center than near the edges. But....you will need to do quite a bit of counting to be certain this is true.\n\nOnce you have enough data to be confident of where this molecule is likely to be, you can construct a wavefunction that represents this distribution. And, using the rules of quantum mechanics you can construct and apply special operators on this wavefunction to ask it questions, like what this distribution would look like if you nudged it to the left, or enlarged the box, and so on. It's fun to ask for example, what happens when you put *two* molecules in the box.\n\n----\n\n >  Meaning, if I see a photon hits some random spot on the wall, there's not even a single way that it got there?\n\nThere is something in quantum mechanics called a \"path integral\" that describes the motion of quantum mechanical objects as it goes from point A to point B. Roughly speaking the path integral is a weighted sum over all possible paths from A to B. There's the direct line from A to B, and then there's all the wiggly paths you can imagine. All of these paths add up constructively and destructively to give the quantum mechanical description of how a particle propagates from A to B. The weights are such that the path that matches the classical trajectory is the strongest, followed by some tiny corrections that are particularly accentuated in a quantum system.\n\n----\n\n >  If you launch a photon at a double slit, it's impossible to figure out exactly where the photon will go. The future is uncertain, and one is chosen probabilistically.\n\nChanging gears, well, you can say that even the current state is probabilistic -- at the very beginning, the system is in some kind of state that is represented by some kind of wavefunction. \n\nHowever, this wavefunction evolves in time deterministically. When you advance a wavefunction forwards or backwards in time, you make use of a special time evolution operator which is not random.\n",

                "Yes, absolutely, that's the idea behind cognitive therapies, which have been shown to be very effective (and getting better with further developments) in treating depression.\n\nThe brain isn't a static thing, it's always changing and adapting. New connections are formed, strengthened, and weakened in every moment. Look at brain changes like momentum, as in a snowball rolling down a hill; the more a mental pattern is repeated, the more cemented it becomes, or the more momentum it accumulates. The more reinforced and more emotionally charged our mental formations and patterns are, the more power they have, and the harder they are to stop, but they are always reversible with some work.\n\nDepression is essentially the accumulation of a bunch of negative, self-damaging mental patterns. Undoing depression requires going in and reconditioning/rewiring these mental patterns, through habitual reinforcement.\n\nIt's actually great to view the brain like another muscle, in that it has the capacity for self-healing and growth. Whereas physical therapy stimulates and activates the right muscles in the right way to promote healing, cognitive therapy stimulates and activates the neurological parts of the brain in the right way to promote healing.\n\nInterestingly, just like the body, the brain has self-healing capacities, that are often held back by trauma or faulty cognitive patterns. Many newer therapies are therefore centered around removing certain \"blocks\" in the mental system, kind of like how a massage therapist works out \"knots\" in the neck and shoulders so that the muscles can naturally heal.\n\nThere's lots of books on this. You can research neurogenesis and cognitive therapies, of which I highly recommend looking into DBT and MBCT. I currently recommend Mindsight by Dan Seigel for a good intro to all of this."

                "The  United  States  entered  WWII  late.  The  US  did  not  start  to  rearm  until  1938.  It  started  a  peacetime  draft  in  1940,  the  same  year  it  passed  the  Two  Ocean  Navy  Act.  In  1941,  US  Industry  was  still  gearing  up  for  a  major  war.  It  sold  weapons  to  Great  Britain  and  France  before  the  war  started,  and  much  larger  orders  were  placed  after  the  war  started.  However,  these  weapons  were  obsolete,  like  the  Curtis  Hawk  75  and  Voight  Vindicator  divebombers.  Newer  weapons,  like  the  P-40,  P-39  and  B-24  bombers  took  longer  to  build,  and  were  not  ready  until  the  summer  of  1940,  after  France  fell.  It  can  honestly  be  said  the  United  States  provided  little  in  the  way  of  material  asistance  to  the  Third  French  Republic  in  1940.  After  the  United  State  was  fully  mobilized,  it  was  able  to  equip  two  Free  French  Armies,  in  time  for  the  1944  liberation  of  France.      \n\n That  was  another bone  of  contention.  Especially with  the  Soviet  Union.  The  United  States  did  not  open  up  a  Second  Front  until  June  6  1944.  That  is  when  the  US  British,  Canadian  Polish  and  Free  French  armies  began  to  engage  a  large  number  of  Germans.  The  earlier  campaigns  in  Tunesia,  Sicily  and  Italy  engaged  far  fewer  German  troops.      ",
                "This is a follow-up question:\n\nWhen talking about WW2, people usually define it as the European Theater. There's a lot of debate on whether U.S. intervention over there.\n\nHowever, could I also ask whether American's intervention helped in the Pacific Theater both in the Chinese theater with KMT against Japan and in South East Asia?\n",
                "There can be no question that lend-lease had a huge impact on the war. The US poured fully the equivalent of the combined GDP of the UK and France (plus a bit more) into the war effort through lend-lease alone. Without that aid the UK would have starved and its industry and military would have ground to a halt, and Soviet industry and logistics would have also ground to a halt.\n\nA lot of the warfighting materiel that lend-lease provided was obsolete, old airplanes, old tanks, and so forth, but that's not where the main advantage of lend-lease was. The main advantage was in logistical support. Providing food and basics like clothing and shoes for soldiers and workers. Providing steel and oil and coal. In the case of the Soviet Union almost their entire industry and logistical operations had become utterly dependent on lend-lease. Factories that would not have been able to run without raw materials. Would not have been able to deliver their products to the front lines using locomotives and trucks.\n\nIf Soviet factories had operated at only a fraction of their capacity during the war, and if they had had to divert a significant amount of that capacity to building locomotives and trucks in order to facilitate basic logistical and industrial infrastructure needs how many fewer T-34 tanks would they have manufactured? How many fewer bullets would have been made? How many fewer bullets would have made it to the front lines? And so forth. Would the USSR have lost the battle of Kursk? The battle of Stalingrad?\n\nSimilarly, the battle of Britain was a close thing, with a nation on the brink of starvation, unable to produce the aircraft needed to strike into Germany, low on fuel, and so forth would Britain have been able to survive additional waves? Additional, inevitable, battles over the skies of Britain, additional Blitzes? Remember that in the 1940s Britain imported more than 2/3 of its food. Without American assistance in building a massive amount of new shipping capability (with Liberty ships and so forth) as well as actively protecting shipments and shipping lanes in the North Atlantic through numerous and extensive anti-submarine measures it was far more likely for the U-boats to have effectively blockaded a significant amount of trade to Britain.\n\nAnd without the UK and the USSR able to fight effectively the outcome of the war would have not been the same.\n\n-\n\nThe question of whether or not it would have been possible for the Allies to win the war with only American logistical assistance but not military assistance is much harder to gauge, because it's far more speculative and there are far more potential variations. My gut says that it would not have been possible because there was no other realistic check on Japanese power in the Pacific than the US. The Soviets were in no position to take on the Japanese on land until the war on the Eastern front had wrapped up, and the British (and their commonwealth partners) were in no position to take on the Japanese and win. More so, without US bombers and service men participating in the Allied bombing campaign, German industry would have been able to run at a significantly greater capacity. Even more significant, the Japanese would have been capable of providing significant lend-lease type assistance to the European Axis powers. Imagine what happens if you steam, say, the Yamato and the Musashi plus a handful of fleet carriers and a gaggle of submarines over into the Atlantic to take on shipping and naval forces and to make raids against land targets. Imagine what happens when the Japanese army in China opens a front against the Soviets, and able to concentrate all their efforts (industrially and militarily) on the fight. Or, imagine what happens when combined Axis forces invade Iran and shut down that supply route from the US to the Soviets. And so forth."

They only way we could detect their presence would be gravitationally. Or perhaps there could be interactions between the two models, but only at a very, very high energy, so that at low energies they are effectively decoupled. \n\nI'm currently a physics grad student, and I once was talking with one of the experimentalists who's looking for dark matter in the form of WIMPs (weakly inetracting massive particles). I asked him about this \"disjoint standard model,\" and whether it could account for dark matter, and his answer was basically, \"Well, it certainly could be true, but it sure would suck for our efforts to detect it experimentally.\" ",

The only reason we perceive it as being so powerful is the magnitude at which matter gathers locally (i.e. the Earth).\n\nCompare the effects of gravity and electromagnetism on a simple nail... you can overcome ALL of the gravity of ALL of the matter in the ENTIRE Earth with a magnet the size of a Tic-Tac.",
                "Keep in mind, Dark Matter is a tool we use to explain why our observations don't match our otherwise expected results. We have never directly observed dark matter. We can't know for sure exactly what properties it has. We know what properties it doesn't have because if it had them, we would have observed them already.\n\nHowever, for dark matter to \"work\" (to solve the problem it was thought up to solve) it would have to be \"non-self interacting.\" I'll try to explain why.\n\nLet me start by explaining why we think dark matter exists. We started looking at galaxies a few decades ago. We calculated that a galaxy's brightness could tell us about how much mass was in there. We know from our solar system that 99% of the mass of the system is in the sun. We know how bright stars of different masses are, so we used that to figure out how massive a galaxy should be. On galaxies we can see well, we actually know how matter is distributed from the center moving out. \n\nWe also know that light gets Doppler Shifted when stars are moving toward us or away from us. So in a spinning galaxy you have one side moving away from earth and another side moving toward us. Since we can find they Hydrogen Emission Spectrum in the light from these stars, we can tell how fast they're moving by how far the emission spectrum has shifted. Again, we can see how fast stars are moving from the center moving out.\n\nSo scientists took these two pieces of information: We can calculate the mass of a galaxy based on how much light it emits. From that we can calculate how fast it should rotate using updated versions of Kepler's Laws for orbits. Then we checked that number vs what we measured for how fast the galaxy is actually rotating and we found that these [two numbers are different!](_URL_2_) Stars near the edge of galaxies are moving much faster than we predicted they would based on their mass (brightness).\n\nOne solution to this problem was Dark Matter: what if there is mass we can't see? It would have to be gravitationally attracted to the galaxy to make an impact on how the galaxy spins. To actually solve the problem though, this Dark Matter would have to form a [cloud shape, a halo,](_URL_0_) around the disk of the galaxy. If it forms a halo, then that means it can't be the standard matter we see every day. \n\nIf you have a big swirling cloud of regular matter, tiny particles rotating around a central axis, eventually those tiny particles start colliding and bumping into one another. Some times they stick together from electromagnetic forces, other times they bounce off and scatter. If you wait long enough a system like this will form a disk. This is because of the Conservation of Angular Momentum. At first every particle in the cloud has it's own random angular momentum. The cloud as a whole has angular momentum equal to the average angular momentum of all the particles in it. Particles swirling in the \"wrong\" direction run into particles going the \"right\" way, slow particles get bumped by faster ones. Over time the angular momentum of each particle gets closer and closer to the average angular momentum of the whole cloud. Let me know if that makes sense.\n\nSo this is why people say dark matter isn't effected by Electromagnetic forces. If it was, then dark matter particles would average their angular momentum over time to form a disk. But if it formed a disk, it wouldn't explain the observations we make about galaxies. Also it would effect our observations about electromagnetic interactions here on Earth, but we haven't observed that.\n\nDark matter is still part of the frontier of physics. We should talk about it carefully, because it may be different than we describe it today, or it may not exist at all. It is just the most popular way to explain a set of discrepancies. Dark Matter still has problems, and there are [other](_URL_1_) (less popular) ways to explain the discrepancies without inventing a new kind of matter, never before seen. Those still have problems too. \n\nI worry that people talk about Dark Matter today with the same certainty scientists discussed Ether in the 1800's. Just remember that its not on the same stable footing as Relativity or Quantum Mechanics. There are still a lot of questions to answer.",
                "It's pretty tempting to consider the possibility of dark photons, i.e. long range gauge interactions of dark matter, see for example this [blog post](_URL_1_)/[paper](_URL_0_). However while possible in principle, that paper claims a pretty tiny upper limit on the coupling constant for such a force at about 10^(-4), so the possibility is pretty strongly constrained by experiment. But like many statements about dark matter, this is partly predicated on the assumption that DM is made up of a single particle of a particular mass range, so if that is incorrect the limit would almost certainly be much weaker.\n\nOn the other hand, a dark matter analog of the weak force (short range due to Higgs mechanism/massive force carriers) or strong force (short range due to confinement) should be much less constrained by what we know, since these possibilities wouldn't lead to long-range effects. This possibility seems downright natural. You could almost argue it would be strange if there wasn't such a force acting on them."

The napalm bomb has been replaced by the thermobaric bomb, and flamethrowers, being bulky, dangerous, short-ranged pieces of equipment, have been replaced by anything from precision bomb drops through man-portable missiles. Some missiles and unguided systems like Panzerfaust 3 have very good thermobaric and explosive rounds as well, and they are much better than flamethrowers for the same job."

                "I think your question should say:\n\nIf the NSA has backdoors in some computer/mobile networks why haven't hackers exploited them?\n\nTo answer:\n  \n1. The ANT backdoors (ANT stands for Access Network Technology) are target only, that means that only people/organizations and governments who are actually targeted get the *special* hardware. \n\nThis also means that it is outside the reach of most hackers who know how to deal with hardware/BIOS,  they simply do not have access to it. This is secret spy stuff, by which companies sell parts to other companies and only those who know, know about it. \n\n2. Finding hardware backdoors takes a lot of forensic work and requires specific software and equipment (like in a lab), the hardware is also proprietary (only the builders know how it was built) ) and needs to be backward engineered. This makes it outside the reach of most everyone. Unless someone literally hands you a back-doored motherboard (this piece helps run your computer parts) and a team of experts, and a few years (Most computers do not allow user-mode programs to have direct hardware access).\n  \n3. There is no evidence that other hackers have not exploited these backdoors or at least backward engineered them, by other hackers I mean fully funded intelligence organizations or large tech companies, this is happening every day on a large scale behind the scenes, again this is secret stuff.\n  \n4. The skill level of hardware hacking is high because it requires specific engineering and job related knowledge, the people that have this knowledge usually have families and a good job.\n\nFor those that want more info here is a good white paper on \"Rakshasa\" (hardware backdoor): _URL_0_\n",

Modern day cryptography (secret internet code) is done using a standard procedure anyone can learn how to use. This standard is called RSA encryption and you can learn the basics of it [here](_URL_0_) if you wish. It is based upon the property that in mathematics it is easier to multiply two numbers than it is to factorize a number.\n\nSo the NSA has a backdoor into this system because they helped make it and sort of reversed engineered the back door while creating the standard. You can watch more detail about this [here](_URL_2_).\n\nThe NSA is also involved is private company affairs and been suspected to create back doors in many big companies such as Microsoft. See [here](_URL_1_) for more detail.\n\n\nThe NSA also ironically (because they have broken a few themselves) uses law to extract information from companies such as lavabit and google. They took down Lavabit, a privately encrypted email service, took down their site so they wouldn't have to compy with data requests. The NSA or a similar organization used the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty to aquire a copy of Silk Road which is one of the domino's in shutting it down.\n\nEdit: Messed up links.\n\nEdit2: As /u/0xB10B pointed out, Lavabit took down their site so they wouldn't have to compy with data requests.",

The backdoors remain secure because hackers haven't yet found or exploited them (of course, it's probably only a matter of time).\n\n3. The backdoors remain secure because they're locked-down in a manner that reduces their scope. For example, a backdoor might require being \"turned on\" by a server administrator, and given limited access. Thus, the potential for exploit by hackers is limited.\n\n4. The backdoors require resources to exploit that are out of the reach of the hackers that you hear about (e.g. they require supercomputing resources or they require access to significant parts of the network backbone, putting the exploits only in the hands of national governments and, perhaps, zombie network controllers).\n\n5.

                "The term \"backdoor\" is being misused by media outlets trying to sensationalize the reality.\n\nBackdoor in security terms, is exactly like it sounds, unfettered access and control. Just like your house has locks and security, devices have locks and security. Just because a thief can kick down your door, pick your lock, or in masterful instances, disarm your alarms, doesn't mean the thief has backdoor access to your house.\n\nThe NSA has a catalogue of capabilities, the same as a locksmith. The question you should be asking is, \"does our government have the ability to hack a network or a device\" and the plain and simple answer is yes.\n\nFor network security to work, the most effective tool, is enforced network policies. Once policies are well defined, you design your infrastructure from the ground up to enforce those policies. This is as simple as physical control (locked doors, communications closets) and logging access, to more technical policies that enforce password changes every 30,60, or 90 days, strict patch control and testing on desktops and network hardware etc.\n\nThe majority of computer infrastructures have very weak if any policy, and even less policy enforcement. If you don't enforce your kids to lock the door to the house when they leave, then it makes it much easier for someone to have what the media is sensationalizing, \"backdoor access\".\n\n\nEdit*\nTL;DR - There is no backdoor, there are security vulnerabilities that they and other hackers can exploit.

Rather, they use the same tools/techniques that hackers/crackers do to exploit these systems.  \n",
                "Because the ones who do keep their mouths shut about it. Why make a target of yourself?",
                "Hackers have and do use these backdoors. I imagine they just prefer for us to not know about it.",
                "I worked at a financial company for 6+ years and we were hacked numerous times and several we couldn't figure out how they broke the encryption/protocol/system as there was nothing we could find we did wrong. We simply wrote off the stolen money, wiped the system clean and reinstalled fresh, instituted a few new rules (minimal installation, nothing installed that wasn't directly used by applications, etc, raised the requirements to get access to the system), and forced everyone to sign/reminded them about their non-disclosure agreements, and then broke the law by not notifying anyone because there was no proof it happened unless the hackers themselves confessed.\n\nDon't assume because you have't heard about it means it didn't happen. Had this got out that we were losing millions a year due to breaches that were in several cases a year unexplainable, we would have lost millions/billions - and several of the V.P.'s that jump from institution to institution had indicated ours wasn't the only one experiencing this, hence everyone felt better with the course of action we took.",
                "When they say that CIA and FBI have backdoors, it usually dosn't mean software backdoors. Because, yes hackers will probably find them and abuse them. Usually it means a pretty physical onsite backdoor in their server room. Which is the best kind of backdoor.\n\nAnd usually they get those pretty easily. They are apparently very persuasive being a government body. An older collegue of mine recalls a story of one of his friend from silicon valley that refused to cooperate. All his business hardware was confiscated without warning one day, on some terror charge. The company was essentially shutdown.\n\nWhat has been in the media lately was a suspicion that a elliptic encryption algorithm, published by NSA, had a potential backdoor in it, because the paper contained a few pseudo random numbers that could be used as a basis for implementing the encryption. \n\nHowever, as for now we don't actually know if they can abuse it. Theoretically, with publicly available crypto knowledge, it should not help them much. But again, they have a lot of resources, it is possible that they picked the numbers very carefully so it enabled them to break the encryption much faster than usual.",
                "Most likely they have.  \n\nThe thing is, when you find a bug that is a security vulnerability it's not always obvious if it was deliberate  or not.  Sometimes (as with the NSA putting a shitty RNG in NIST standards) they get caught, but not always.  \n\nWhen it comes to the secret firmware injected by the NSA that we're hearing about yesterday/today, well that's where things get interesting.  If your company really had no knowledge of it, and you find this secret firmware running on your hardware, you start thinking it's a chinese counterfeit (either counterfeit parts or an entire counterfeit device), you report it... to the FBI, who consult with the NSA, and are either told to shut up or are given a lie.  \n\nDistinguishing  between a deliberate  backdoor (either from the company or from an intelligence agency), or a bug is quite hard.  Particularly some  of the stuff today - which is hardware  injection attacks on seemingly benign devices are actually quite difficult to do much about.\n\nOh, and companies are finding spy  'bugs' in their buildings  on a relatively regular basis, if you don't know any better and assume they are chinese rather than the NSA you really have no way of  knowing.

                "Think about it. What is the point of LEAKING a hack? There has to be a social engineering purpose. Everything a hacker or an authority tells you had a purpose behind it.\n\nIt's almost impossible to generalize anything about hackers but I believe most have an innate love of technology in general and the internet in specific (at least the original free internet before NSA weaponized it.) There is also evidence to suggest that hackers are innately more ethical due to the absence of what Drs Milgram  &  Zimbardo refer to as the Lucifer Effect which basically means that obedience to authority is the root cause of evil (ie. holocausts) and the internet is, as the CEO of Google described it \"the first thing mankind has invented that he did not understand; it is the first experiment in true leaderlessness. \n\nHackers also tend to have higher intelligence which is shown to correlate with higher morals. Basically everything the NSA  &  FBI say about hackers is the opposite if the truth.

At that point, goodbye, privacy, for everyone.\n\nFuck you, NSA, and thank you very much.",
                "There are two basic terms in cyber security you should understand.  **Vulnerabilities** and **Exploits**.\n\n\nA **vulnerability** is a part of the software that can potentially be broken into. An **exploit** is when you take advantage of that vulnerability and actually break in to a system.  Both of these things are developed independently for the most part, so they find a vulnerability, then they find an exploit for the vulnerability.\n\nTo make an analogy to breaking into someone's home, a vulnerability would be your windows, your locks, or any sort of other thing someone could use to gain access to your home.  An exploit would be a set of lock picks (to pick the lock) or a baseball bat (to break the window).  \n\nThere are two ways you can develop ways to gain access.  You can try to discover new vulnerabilities (maybe try to go in through the chimney) or you can develop new exploits for existing vulnerabilities (use a better set of lock picks against the door).\n\nThere is nothing stopping a typical blackhat hacker/cracker from developing new exploits or vulnerabilities that a nation-state currently has developed.  The NSA/FBI is extremely secretive with their tools, though, so it is very unlikely that a blackhat hacker/cracker will be able to steal the blueprints of their unique exploits/vulnerabilities they have discovered.\n\nTo summarize. There is nothing stopping the public from discovering the vulnerabilities or developing the exploits the government does, but there is no way to take advantage of the exploits/vulnerabilities that already are discovered for your own use.",
                "It's all kept hush hush because if the coder/hacker does get into the real system, they'll probably get a 6-7 figure job offer to come in and strengthen the systems. ",
                "A lot of the answers here seem to have many of the pieces without the whole story, or a lot of technical details. Maybe this helps?\n\nFor one, we don't know if people are using some of the vulnerabilities. It's certainly possible that at least some of them have been compromised.\n\nOn the other hand, it's very unlikely.\n\nSome of them are downright impossible - a lot of the \"backdoors\" are literally things as simple as a physical splitter in the wire that goes to a room that says \"NSA, Access Restricted\". Others are just the NSA saying \"Dear Microsoft: Send us all of your data. And you're not allowed to tell anyone we asked or we'll throw you in jail forever.\" I suppose it's not unthinkable that those would be compromised, but when people talk about hackers finding backdoors, they usually doing mean entering physical back doors.\n\nBut there are almost certainly unknown software vulnerabilities too. We know of a few cases where they pretty clearly tried to get vulnerabilities into the design of some security implementations. There are doubtless some that we don't know about.\n\nBut the thing is - they're *very* smart. A lot of the vulnerabilities people have been worrying about (particularly in the wake of Snowden, though he's mostly responsible for popularizing some fears that a small number of people already had) are interesting in that only the person who designed them could reasonably exploit them.\n\nThink of it this way: imagine you put a two-hundred character secret password into a program. If you know the password, you have a \"backdoor\", but for anyone else, guessing that password is as hard as guessing the normal password.\n\nThe actual details are (usually) more complicated, but a unifying theme of a lot of the things people are most afraid of is that they're essentially undetectable. Being undetectable means that they're *also* undetectable to would-be intruders.\n\n(potentially complicated stuff follows) The recent stuff about the random-number generator in most chips, for example, is based on the fear that there are known ways to alter the manufacturing process in a (basically) physically undetectable way that produces numbers that are *very* slightly nonrandom*. So slightly that there's no known way to notice that they're not actually random without getting a completely unreasonable sample of the numbers they generate (as it turns out, telling if something is truly random is very hard to do). So there's almost no way to know that they're not truly random, much less what the pattern is. And I mean completely unreasonable. The rate these things spit out numbers at, it would take much longer than we're likely to be using the chips. But, if you know the details of the procedure that's actually generating the \"random\" numbers, you can predict them perfectly.\n\n*Technically, they're completely nonrandom. I think putting it this way makes sense though.",

                "One of the problems with evaluating Luxemburg's position before her death in January 1919 is that the jumble of contemporary events often intersected with her existing writings on the course and direction of a proletarian revolution. Thus tactical moves and reactions after the outbreak of the November Revolution gain an ideological gloss while her own writings and exhortations during this period had an eye towards immediate events. This intellectual ouroboros is tangled and it is easy for a historian of the November Revolution to fall down a rabbit hole of competing theory.\n\nWithout getting too much into the weeds of Luxemburg's theories, her championship of democracy at first seems at odds with her strident advocacy of the need for a proletarian revolution and the need to triumph over capitalism. This is not as contradictory though as it first appears. Even though she shared some ideological affinities with Lenin, one point of departure between the two revolutionaries was over the role of the party in the revolution. over the course of 1917-18, it was becoming clear that Lenin's favored a more central organization by a smallish party apparatus. Lenin, it should be stressed, was more than capable of making tactical compromises and fit ideology to emergent conditions, and both the onset of civil war and the continued problem of the Germans made a central organization a greater likelihood for the Bolsheviks. For Luxemburg, centralization not only opened up the likelihood of dictatorship by a leadership clique, but more importantly denuded the potential for a proletariat revolution to reach the proletariat. This is why both Luxemburg and Liebknecht championed democracy over a vanguardist revolution in late-1918. A mass-party for her had the greatest potential to reach the disaffected German proletariat and give shape to a revolution. The party and its leadership would not function as an executive, but rather as an agitator that could make the proletariat step outside its halo and destroy the capitalist order. In her view, isolated pockets of revolution could not succeed and create a truly mass movement. \n\nLuxemburg's championship of a democratic road to communism was not really an abandonment or dilution of her rather strident brand of Marxism. She still unwilling to compromise with SPD democrats and both the KPD and the Spartacists had an intransigence and hostility towards bourgeois democracy. In more than a few ways, her support for liberal democracy was a way of using the tools of bourgeois society against it. Luxemburg's critique of the Bolsheviks' centralizing tendencies assumed an air of prophecy after Stalin, but this obscures some of her own commitment to an immediate radical restructuring of German society. This puts her opposition to the Bolsheviks in late-1918, if it can be termed opposition, into sharper relief. It is not that Luxemburg was against communism, but rather that she championed a different *sort* of communism than that which was emerging in Russia. \n\n*Sources*\n\nEpstein, Catherine. *The Last Revolutionaries: German Communists and Their Century*.

From a functional standpoint, the pancreas is basically two separate organs, the endocrine pancreas and the exocrine pancreas. The exocrine part is in charge of producing all the digestive enzymes necessary to break most food down after it comes out of the stomach. \n\nThe pancreas is difficult to operate on in part because cancer often causes the pancreas to grow towards and around some pretty major bunches of arteries and nerves, which makes it very difficult to effectively remove the mass",

                "The pancreas produces powerful digestive enzymes. Unlike the enzymes in the stomach, which only work in strong acids, pancreatic enzymes work in the considerably less acidic small intestine. These enzymes digest meat, among other things.\n\nPeople are made of meat at about the right PH for pancreatic enzymes to work. Close enough, at least, that if you even nick the pancreas the wrong way, it will start digesting every organ in the area. This kills the patient. As a result, surgeons are afraid of the pancreas and almost never operate on it. It's a little yellow bag of kills-the-patient and it's really super bad news. Don't touch it. Don't even look at it. Pancreas bad.",
                "The pancreas doesn't just produce insulin. Type I diabetics don't produce enough insulin, but they do produce the other enzymes you need to survive. \n\nThe pancreas itself is sort of like a bunch of very thin bubbles, full of (basically) acid. If you disturb it, sometimes that \"acid\" gets loose and starts damaging surrounding structures. So in general, surgeons do everything they can not to disrupt it. \n\nPancreatic cancer specifically is bad because it doesn't typically cause symptoms until very late. So it grows and spreads until it starts pinching off important tubes, and by then it's nearly impossible to treat.",
                "Some comments missed the mark just a little when talking about the pancreatic function. \n\nLike someone mentioned, the pancreas is both an endocrine and exocrine organ. The endocrine portion comes from what's called the Islets on Langerhans, which is the portion of the pancreas that produces insulin. Type I diabetes is caused by a destruction of these endocrine cells, whether autoimmune or otherwise, which leads to decreased or ceased insulin production. \n\nThe exocrine function of the pancreas is to release digestive enzymes, like lipase (breaks down lipids or fats) and amylase (breaks down sugars) and others, as well as sodium bicarbonate to neutralize the chyme that comes from the stomach via the pyloris in the jejunum. That secretion also mixes with bile salts, which helps with the absorption of lipids.\n\nLike others have said, the pancreas is fragile, and having these digestive juices in the free space of the body is quite damaging. So surgical intervention is quite risky. There are such things as pancreas transplants, however, they are mainly done for the treatment of type I diabetes\n\nJust a note, the enzyme responsible for breaking down protein, which is pepsin, is formed in the stomach itself."

                "Also something I didn't emphasize enough in my question is why does a 2D random walker have a probability of 100% of returning to its original position? For example, consider my [highly scientific diagram](_URL_0_). Imagine it's a infinite 2D array of points. Isn't what I depicted possible -- where a random walker at each point has 4 options and just by chance it turns 90 degrees counter clockwise so it never returns to its original position? Or is my understanding of probability under infinite time flawed?",
                "I'm [paraphrasing an answer from Math Overflow](_URL_1_) in a way that will make it more accessible. Let's say you have a random walk in d dimensions. What does it look like when you disregard all but one of the dimensions - you see a 1-d random walk! Since you have d dimensions, we can do this kind of thought experiment for each dimension. So in the end you are really looking at a combination of d one-dimensional random walks (really a \"product\" of sorts). Now, if you are looking at the probability of returning to the origin, in 1 dimension the answer is not that difficult. The answer for d dimensions is really a product of the 1-dimensional probabilities. They are kind of small but for d = 1 and d = 2 they add up to 1 quickly and you find that you return to the original position. When d = 3, they are just small enough that they don't add up to 1, no matter how many steps you allow. \n\nTo be a bit more precise the probability that a 1-d random walks is near the original position after n steps is proportional to n^(-1/2). To find the probability that we'll eventually return you need to sum the probabilities that the walk will return in 1 step, in 2 steps, in 3 steps, ad infinitum. This sum becomes infinite, and so you are sure that you'll eventually return. Now since you are looking at a product of d one-dimensional walks, you expect that the probability of coming back after n steps is going to be proportional to (n^(-1/2))^(d) = n^(-d/2). The sum of these over n is going to be the probability that we'll eventually return.\n\nWhen d is 1, you have a sum of 1/sqrt(n) which is infinite [p-series with p = 1/2](_URL_0_#P-series) as I mentioned. When d is 2, you have the sum of 1/n, which [is also infinite](_URL_0_) and we're sure to come back to the origin. However, when d = 3, you have a convergent series and in the end the probability ends up being less that 1. This is more and more true for larger d.\n\nIn a more philosophical sense, there is just too much space to go to in higher dimensions. In 1-dimensional space you can only go left and right. In 2 dimensions you have east, west, north and south and gets just a bit harder to eventually come back but not difficult enough to make it improbable. In 3 dimensions you now have up and down and it's just too much to handle with certainty. This issue becomes even worse in higher dimensions.\n\nTo get the actual probability you need to look at [Polya's random walk constants](_URL_2_).",
                "Followup:\n\nBecause there is a finite probability of a random walk moving out any distance R before returning to the origin, can we infer that there is a 100% chance that a 1-D random walk will eventually reach all points?  (Because we could consider the random walk after reaching R to be a new random walk, but per the theorem there is a 100% chance it will travel -R from there.)"

                "In very general terms, for speed you want a lot of horsepower,  whereas for towing/hauling torque output is more important. The various engines in your example will be designed with that in mind.",
                "A couple of things the truck one will usually be a diesel and will normally be tuned to have a more broad power curve (peak power is over a large rpm range and usually at lower rpms) to prevent you from having to shift gear so much, a side effect of this is they should be slightly more fuel efficient.\n\n & #x200B;\n\nThe far bigger difference however is not the engine but the gearbox. The gearbox can take the power of the engine and output a range of torque at the wheels. Truck gearboxes have lots of gears to ensure they are always outputting the optimal amount of torque. \n\n & #x200B;\n\nIn theory if you had a gearbox with enough gears you could use a superbike engine to pull just as heavy a load as a big truck engine, it would just be incredibly noisy, use lots of fuel and you would constantly be changing gears due to the narrow power band (power peaks over a small range at a high rpm) of the bike engine.",
                "Horsepower is how fast an engine can do work torque is how much work that engine can do.",
                "It all comes down to the power stroke. This is when the fuel is combusted, and hot, expanding gasses provide pressure, which is force, to push on a piston producing work.\n\nForce that goes around an axis is called torque. It get's its own fancy word. If you push a heavy box across the floor, that's force. If you turn a thumb screw, that's torque. Same thing.\n\nWork is force over time. The best illustration of this is if you want to push that box across the floor in half the time, you have to perform twice the work.\n\nForce doesn't have a speed associated with it, it's just an amount. Diesel trucks are designed to take advantage of diesel fuel, which burns really slowly. In the diesel engineering world, any Diesel engine that runs faster than about 1,300 RPM is considered a \"high speed\" engine. Remember that most diesels in the world power pumps, generators, trains, and cargo ships, they're gigantic, where you're whole body can fit inside the cylinder of some of these. You'll be hard pressed to find a Diesel engine that runs faster than ~5,000 RPM - maybe look at a Volkswagen GTI. Any faster, and you're dumping still burning, not yet combusted diesel fuel out the exhaust port, and that still burning, still getting hotter fireball is bad for that part of the engine, which wasn't designed to handle combustion. There are also engineering compromises in Diesel engines to handle the heat and force, and these parts and materials don't like moving fast without ripping itself to pieces.\n\nAnyway, since diesel burns slow as shit and hot as balls, these engines have very long strokes - combusting diesel produces a long power stroke, there is a long time you can capture energy from combustion and turn it into work.\n\nGasoline burns really fast. Cosworth was building an F1 racing engine that ran at 22,000 RPM before the 2016(?) engine speed limit. It produces less force, but you can produce it more often. Remember what I said about work? Want to cut the time? Do more work. Acceleration favors work in the math of these equations, so gasoline is the champion of acceleration, hence racing engines. Also acceleration can be negative, not only can you speed up quickly, but you can slow down, quickly, too, because the combustion event can be so short, you can get a new charge of fuel and air in the cylinder sooner that produces the new greater or lesser force. We call this throttle response. In a diesel, you have to wait for that power stroke to finish, a lot longer, before a new charge goes into that cylinder. 2-stroke and rotary engines have even faster throttle response because there's less or no rotation that isn't producing power.\n\nSo, can you race on a diesel? You sure can. There are all sorts of racing where torque is everything. Is it fast? Not really. Diesel can get you high speeds with gearing, and there's enough torque to turn those gears to get that vehicle up to top speed, eventually - you need torque, like int the Bugatti Veyron, to overcome wind and rolling resistance, but they'll never match the acceleration properties of gasoline. You can compensate with insane gearing, and lots, and lots of gears, but then you're talking a transmission that doesn't exist, that's too big, too heavy, and you spend too much time shifting, and time shifting is not time putting power to the road. Maybe one day there will be a CVT that can do it for a diesel racing application, but I don't believe the materials are there.",
                "Ignore almost all the comments in this thread. \n\n Part of the difference is the amount of power contained in diesel vs gasoline. Diesel has roughly 147k BTU/gallon vs 125k BTU for gas. But a much more important part of this is engine design. A longer stroke leads to much more torque being developed.\n\nWith the longer stroke and more force being exerted on parts things are built heavier to withstand typical use. Also with a longer stroke parts move faster relatively. (Look at a record spinning, the center parts move less feet per minute than the outside).  Consider the mass of pistons and rods changing directions from upward to downward movement in the cylinder. It's crazy to think how fast these things happen. For example a engine running at the relatively low speed of 1200RPM the piston changes directions 20 times /second. Valves open and close 10 times. So these large diesels usually are limited to low rpm, 2100 usually being the max for 15 liter + displacement engines.\n\nThese engines develop incredible amounts of torque at low RPM. A typical modern semi engine would make 1800lb.ft. of torque at 1600rpm and have an astounding 1200lb.ft of torque at idle/700 RPM. where the amazing AMG C63 doesn't make 350lb.ft of torque until almost 2500 RPM and maxes out at about 400. The available power, especially down low in the RPM range combined with low gearing/lots of gears allows truck to move incredible weight.\n\nAlso dont confuse lots of gears with low geared. My diesel dodge 2500 can move way more than a honda accord and would have similar gearing, albeit much stronger components to handle the additional power.",
                "Sticking strictly by your question I'd say it comes down to gearing.  A truck with a big engine won't go very fast in 1st gear but will be able to pull very heavy things.  A car with a big engine (Corvette for example) can go nearly 80 in 1st gear but you wouldn't want to haul a trailer with it.",
                "I was intrigued by this question,, but didn't find the info I was looking for. Using just gas engines of the same displacement, what makes these differences. Is it bore vs stroke, compression, valve timing, etc?",
                "The gear ratio in the transmission has a lot to do with it.  (I have a 20 hp tractor that can pull my 300 hp truck backwards when it's trying to go forward.)",
                "With sports cars there tends to be more cylinders leading to a higher rpm so it can drive the wheels faster, with truck engines the have fewer Cylinders but larger ones giving them more torque, which allows the truck to pull heavier loads but not reach as high of a top speed.",
                "There are excellent answers like /u/mredding posted, but a bit more ELI5:\n\nMotors, like any other mechanical devices, are designed to do a task. You use the best design for the job you want to accomplish. A sledgehammer is fantastic for breaking up concrete slabs, but not an elegant device for putting picture hangers in your walls. A small gasoline engine (in general; there are exceptions) is designed to run very fast and be very responsive. A large diesel engine is designed to run at a much slower rate and be efficient.\n\nTrucking companies don't care about 0-60 mph (0-100 km/h) times. They want low fuel costs and long engine lives (lower rotation speed = less wear and tear on the engine per unit distance). A sports car owner wants something that goes FAST and does it RIGHT NOW, and if it only lasts for 200k miles, so what? Most people drive under 12k miles per year, so it's good for 15 years or more. A standard tractor-trailer rig can be driven 70 hours per week by one driver. Assuming an average speed of 50 mph (they go faster, but they have to fill up, take breaks, etc., and this is a *very* conservative estimate), they will cover 3500 miles per week, or 182k miles per year.\n\nCan you make one engine do the other's job? Yes, with gears. But it will be a lot harder to maintain a Corvette engine driving a semi, and a semi engine driving a Corvette will have godawful acceleration, and that is completely ignoring the weight and friction losses from all the gears."

                "I'm not quite sure that 'gibberish parody' is *quite* a fair description of 'Bohemian Rhapsody', but perhaps it's indicative of how controversial Queen were amongst critics and fans. Queen routinely got bad reviews from the likes of *Rolling Stone* and the *NME* in the 1970s. Dave Marsh's commentary on the band in a review of their album *A Day At The Races* in *Rolling Stone* is probably representative of many critics' feelings at the time: \n\n > Queen is the least experimental of such [progressive pop] groups, probably because their commercial aspirations are the most brazen. They have managed to borrow all that's frothiest from their influences, from the fake-orgasmic vocal contortions of Robert Plant to the semi-vaudevillian pop of the Beach Boys and Beatles. In addition, to cement their \"seriousness,\" they use instrumental effects which hint at opera in the same way that bad movie music palely evokes the symphony. Blessed with Freddie Mercury's passable pop voice and guitarist Brian May, who manages to fragment and reassemble the guitar styles of Jimmy Page, Jeff Beck and Eric Clapton in interesting, if pedestrian, ways, Queen will probably top the charts until one or the other of its leaders grows restless and spins off another version.\n\nSteve Pond in a *Rolling Stone* review of their album *The Game* in 1980 referred to 'Bohemian Rhapsody' as a 'brazen hodgepodge'.\n\n*Rolling Stone* denied that Bohemian Rhapsody was of any importance for a long time; it wasn't included on their 1989 list of the top 100 singles of the last 25 years, and on their equivalent 2004 list, it was only #169. The song doesn't figure on a 1987 'Top 150' singles list at the *NME*. It also doesn't appear on a list of the top 100 songs of all time in *Mojo*, selected by their critics, in 2000, but does appear as being 23rd on a list of the top singles of all time by *Mojo* readers in 1997. So the fame and celebration of Queen's 'Bohemian Rhapsody' did not come from critics.\n\nInstead, it came from fans and radio DJs. The very prominent British radio DJ Kenny Everett was given a tape of the song by the band to play on air before its release. In fact, the song was almost not released at all as a single; the record company were perhaps understandably dubious about the commercial prospects of a 6-minute single with an opera section and no real chorus. However, Kenny Everett's breathless championing of the song on air and the strong audience response to the song convinced the record company it might be worth releasing.\n\nAnd worth releasing it was, from a commercial point of view; Mitchell Cohen in a *Phonograph Record* profile of the band in 1976 calls it 'the biggest 45 in a decade'; by the point that Cohen is discussing it, it had sold 1.5 million copies in the UK. Between that and the chart-topping UK re-release of the song after Mercury's death in late 1991, where it topped the charts at Christmas 1991 and sold another million copies, it's actually the 3rd highest selling single in the UK ever, and the highest that's not a charity single. Clearly, the song struck a chord with the public.\n\nAs to why fans liked a six minute single that critics called 'brazen hodgepodge' from a band going for quote unquote seriousness, it's worth remembering that in 1975, 'Bohemian Rhapsody' was released during the critical death throes of 1970s progressive rock. By 1975, progressive rock as a movement had had its day critically and increasingly commercially; where progressive rock bands had success after 1975 it was with music that was much more nakedly commercial than the commonly way-out prog rock of the early 1970s (think Genesis's 'Follow You, Follow Me', or Yes's 'Owner Of A Lonely Heart' or Pink Floyd's almost disco 'Another Brick In The Wall'). By 1975, punk was just around the corner. Most famously and indicatively, the Sex Pistols' first appearance on TV where they caused a scene and swore on television only occurred when Queen had to cancel an appearance.\n\nBut as far as average listeners were concerned, the fads and fashions within music critic circles were another world, and several years of prominent prog rock had led to an acceptance that rock might get a bit ambitious and weird. As a song, 'Bohemian Rhapsody' sets you up to think it's an Elton John-style ballad, and then it subverts that; instead of going to a third verse about what happened after mama killed a man after the guitar solo, instead it suddenly went faux-opera. And soon after that, some hard rock. The combination of surprisingly combined but also readily-understandable musical tropes, along with the band's performances, the high production quality - and the unique-at-the-time multi-tracked stacked harmonies - clearly made for an attractive mix as far as audiences were concerned.\n\nIn terms of what the song is about, Freddie Mercury told *Phonograph Record* in 1976 that:\n\n > t's nice to hear somebody has gone that far to try and interpret a song. I like them to make up their own. If I were to come up with my interpretation, put my views to it, it would just shatter their illusions and things, so...They've got a competition on the radio back home; people had to write in what they thought the song was about. Hundreds and hundreds of letters came in. Some were really amazing.\n \nElsewhere, a 2005 *Uncut* article on the song argues, based on recollections from one of Mercury's personal assistants, that the song is largely about Freddie Mercury's angst about his identity and sexuality. Mercury had been in a long term relationship with boutique owner Mary Austin since in the 1960s, but by 1975 he had increasingly found himself cruising for casual gay sex. The status of gay men in the UK in the 1970s is complicated, with pockets of acceptance of homosexuality in certain parts of society but also a wider homophobia in wider society. In a funny way, Freddie Mercury's affectations of calling people 'darling' and the name of the band were widely seen as trying to buy into the gender-bending androgyny of the glam rock movement, as part of the band's desire for commercial acceptance discussed by Marsh above. Similarly, nobody in the mid-1970s really believed that AC/DC were bisexual, despite their name being a common slang term for bisexuality; they were (correctly, as far as I can tell) seen as co-opting the iconography of glam rock. I think the 2005 *Uncut* article is likely right, insofar as Freddie Mercury's anguish is fairly clear in the song, and [this Daily Mail interview with Austin](_URL_2_) suggests that 1975-76 was about when he revealed to Mary Austin that he was bisexual and when they ceased having a sexual relationship. No doubt his coming to realisations about and acceptance of his sexuality was a difficult road, as it still is for many LGBTI+ people, and all of this might well explain his reluctance to discuss the meaning he felt the song had.\n\nAlso usually referenced when discussing the popularity of the song, in terms of its revival amongst younger audiences who might not have been alive when it was re-released in 1991, is of course [the opening scenes of the 1992 film *Wayne's World*](_URL_0_), where Wayne, Garth, and their friends sing along with gusto. The song was re-released and topped the charts in the UK in December 1991, half a year before *Wayne's World* was released in the UK in May 1992. However, in the US, [Bohemian Rhapsody reached #2 in the Billboard Hot 100 in May 1992](_URL_3_) - very clearly as a result of *Wayne's World*, which [had made over $100 million in box office by that point, and was still in the top 10 biggest movies 3 months after release](_URL_1_). The song being associated with a more modern cultural reference likely provided a way into the song for people not around in 1975, and the sheer popularity of *Wayne's World* meant that 'Bohemian Rhapsody' actually ended up higher in the charts in 1992 in the US than it had in 1975, where it had only reached #9. \n\nAnd in 1992, it was *my* favourite song ever - I bought the single on cassette and played it to death. I think it made sense to me at the time, as a young kid who didn't know who they were, because the verses of the song sounded like Elton John (who was riding a wave of renewed popularity at the time after an indifferent 1980s) and who I was a big fan of because I played the piano. Also, the loud rock bit sounded like Guns 'n' Roses, who were then at a commercial peak. Not coincidentally, Elton and Guns 'n' Roses' Axl Rose dueted on the song at the Freddie Mercury memorial concert that the remaining members of Queen put on after Mercury's death. \n\nAnyway, that more than one generation played a role in making the song popular - in 1992, 'Bohemian Rhapsody' was well-divorced from the mid-1970s prog rock/hard rock context - plays a big role in its status as a very popular song amongst British audiences in particular. Instead of it being baby boomer music redolent of one particular time and place, it's music with a cross-generational appeal, and that goes a long way towards a song's fame and cultural cachet.",
                "For context et’s take a look at the UK chart landscape of the mid 1970s. We may look back fondly to the likes of Bowie and Roxy Music or the excesses of prog rock, but this a narrow picture of the music scene handed down by music journalists.\n\nChart music was in fact  dominated by easy listening ( The Carpenters, John Denver),easy listening soul (Barry White, The Stylistics) and teenybop (The Osmonds, Bay City Rollers). Disco was emerging (George McCrae, Abba) and glam rock, with it’s blend of theatrics and 50s revivalism was still ploughing through in its dying embers ( Mud, Suzi Quatro). And of course there was Christmas, when the British public demonstrated their love of novelty records (Slade, Wizzard) by buying them in droves.\n\nWhy was music so middle of the road? Public access to music was restricted due to the virtual monopoly of national radio stations ( Radio 1 for pop and Radio 2 for easy listening) complemented by a limited repertoire of local BBC and commercial stations. Daytime playlists were drawn  up in committee and DJs tended to be more ‘personalities’ than into the music. When they did champion records they tended to be on the novelty side. Top of The Pops was the main primetime pop show and had a disproportionate influence as, with only three channels around, a performance could get an instant audience of up to 10 million viewers. Pluggers from the record company used various tactics to get the records played by DJs and performed on Top of the Pops as well as  manipulating the charts by buying up records.\n\nOther genres fared better in the album world.  Psychedelia and blues revival had evolved into both hard rock (Black Sabbath, Led Zep) and progressive rock  (Pink Floyd, Yes) – a  blend of experimentation and classical aspirations. Artists here relied on gigs, the music press and word of mouth to get exposure and young males dominated their audience. Sometimes there was crossover into the upper echelons  of the singles chart but these were few and far between. Sitting between the two genres were Queen, who had ploughed away on the gig circuit, and released couple of OK performing albums. For their third album Sheer Heart Attack, Freddie Mercury expressed himself more in the camp theatrics that could be found in the glam/art rock scene whilst the band extended their use of multilayering and other studio effects. The single, Killer Queen, was a massive hit – Queen had found their sound.\n\nSo Queen now ticked a lot of musical boxes- hard, prog glam and  art rock with a good dose of old fashioned pop sensibilities thrown in. Let’s now add a dash of opera. The genre was already in the pop consciousness as art rockers had Sparks had a massive crossover hit with This Town Ain’t is Big Enough Than The Both Of Us  that featured  singer Russell Mael’s operatic falsetto . But Queen took this up a few notches with studio multilayering to create the focal point of what was to become Bohemian Rhaposody. They  then blended this piece with a soft rock ballad, a hard rock solo and   vocal, a multitracked vocal overture, and a gentle coda. Splicing together a hotchpotch of different genres was nothing new – the Beatles used to great effect on the second side of Abbey Road and the concept was used many a time in prog rock albums. But how would this work as a 6 minute single and get radio airplay to help it sell? The Beatles got away with it with Hey Jude, but they happened to be the biggest band in the world. Queen, on the other hand, only had a couple of hits under their belt. Luckily the band knew DJ Kenny Everett who broke it in London’s Capital Radio, playing teasers for a few weeks before playing the whole thing in full. To break the record to the nation, plugger Eric Hall, an old – school spiv, pushed the record onto radio 1’s David Hamilton, pushing the novelty factor being so close to Christmas. Then there was the problem of TV exposure; the band couldn’t play or mime the operatic bits live, so they created a promotional video that could be shown lieu and get prime coverage – especially on Top of The Pops.. It wasn’t the first musical promotional film, but it the first to be so widely used for the time.\n\nSo now they had the exposure and the initial demand – why did it become so massive? As mentioned it was a smorgasbord of many popular genres, performed well and blended superbly. The soft rock ballad had a crossover appeal, especially to easy listening ears that held sway.  The camp operatic section worked for the Christmas singles market (and subsequent comedy tributes), but transcends beyond the initial novelty value the context of the other pieces that accompany it. Big brother networks i.e. records played to younger brothers who then played it to friends, kept the song  alive in young male circles. The fact that Queen become one of the biggest bands in the world (in part due to Bohemian Rhapsody.) helped the song persist in the public arena. "

It's easy to prove something is untrue, it simply has to be false. Proving something is a lie is much more difficult, and would require proof that the politician knew it was false when he said it.\n\nSince it's much harder to verify if someone is lying, it is usually more honest to report what they said was untrue.",

Something being untrue, however, is pretty easy to prove with evidence to the contrary. \n\nAs it stands though, most politicians don't really \"lie\" outright, they present half-truths that imply a greater \"truth\". For example, Paul Ryan's speech at the RNC, he said this:\n\n > Even with all the hidden taxes to pay for the health-care takeover, even with new taxes on nearly a million small businesses, the planners in Washington still didn’t have enough money. They needed more. They needed hundreds of billions more. So they just took it all away from Medicare. Seven hundred and sixteen billion dollars, funneled out of Medicare by President Obama.\n\nThis is factually true... kind of. But it's not the whole story, and the statement implied something else entirely. Namely, that Obama is taking away peoples medicare. He didn't specifically *say* that, but the implication was enough that he didn't have to. People who were watching him and listening to him understood what he was getting at without him directly saying it. He was presenting a half-truth that led people to a particular conclusion. \n\nIt's kind of like saying \"Well, 2+2...\" and leaving the question open. People will assume that the answer is 4, but what if the equation is 2+2+5. Omitting 5 changes everything yet you haven't \"lied\", you've just let someone believe that the equation ended at 2+2.",

The theory which seems to be the current consensus among Hungarian scholars, is that the Carpathian basin was sparsely populated at the end of the IXth century, and the Hungarian tribes moving in were more numerous than previous conquerors, so they could avoid being assimilated like it happened to Bolghars for example.\n\n2. The least widely held theory is that the Hungarian conquerors became the aristocracy of the Carpathian basin and the language of the conquerors substituted that of the conquered. This theory is mostly rejected precisely because there are very few examples of happening this throughout history.\n\n3. László Gyula, a prominent archeologist of the last century suggests that there is a surprising continuity in the Carpathian basin pre and post the Hungarian conquest. According to his findings the settlements of half-settled natives continued to exist in numbers, and the biggest change is that signs appear of some less sedentary people who moved around in a more nomadic fashion for. László argues that Árpád and his warriors were indeed a minority, and have been assimilated into a finno-ugric population which has been living in the Carpathian Basin since at least the VIth century - they would be none others than the Pannonian Avars. He assumes (because of archeological similarities) that the conquering \"Hungarians\" at the end of IXth century were actually a Turkic people.\n\nThis last theory is interesting, but it isn't well-regarded today, and what's more, it doesn't really solve the question *why* Hungarian became the language spoken in the Carpathian Basin. All it does is just pushing back the time of the language-change three hundred years."

You want to make sure you stack insulating materials and vapor-impermeable layers such that vapor is blocked before it reaches the dew point (the temperature falls from body temp through all layers until it reaches ground temp. Somewhere in there it will go below the dew point of your vapor-producing body). That's why the vapor barrier in on the interior side of homes, for instance.

                "Jon Ronson recently published a really good book on the subject of public shaming called 'So You've Been Publicy Shamed' where he talks about modern shaming but also the history of it. He says that basically people decided it was too harsh, and that it would turn petty offenders into actual criminals by making them resent society or by dehumanising them. Interestingly public shaming was still a viable punishment in Delaware until the mid 1900s.",
                "During the 18th and 19th centuries, corporal punishment and other shame-based punishments came under increasing fire (in the United States, at least) for their perceived incompatibility with democratic principles. The American Revolution spurred criticism, for example, that these punishments reinforced social hierarchies antithetical to a democracy of free and equal citizens. English law, for example, reserved flogging for commoners—proper gentlemen were spared such punishments. Inflicting pain \"was the way that sovereigns disciplined their subjects, husbands their waves, parents their children, and masters their servants or slaves.\"\n\nThese perceptions were strengthened during and following the Civil War, especially as an anti-slavery perspective of the conflict began to coalesce. In the public's eye, corporal punishment became inextricably entangled with the institution of slavery—thereby recalling a hierarchy deeply incompatible with the Reconstruction Constitution. As Robert G. Ingersoll, the attorney general of Illinois during Reconstruction, stated:\n >  [T]he fact is that we, citizens of the Republic, feel that certain domestic brutalities are the children of monarchies and despotisms; that they were produced by superstition, ignorance, and savagery; and that they are not in accord with the free and superb spirit that founded and preserves the Great Republic.\n\nAt the same time, the public came to view incarceration as a better way to condemn offenders within the framework of individual liberty. Depriving citizens of their liberty was \"naturally suited to an egalitarian social order; imprisonment expressed what citizens of a republic shared—their liberty—rather than what set the punisher and the punished apart.\"\n\nSources:\n\n* Dan M. Kahan, *What Do Alternative Sanctions Mean?*, 63 U. Chi. L. Rev. 591 (1996)\n* Ryan J. Huschka, *Sorry for the Jackass Sentence: A Critical Analysis of the Constitutionality of Contemporary Shaming Punishments*, 54 U. Kan. L. Rev. 803 (2006)",
                "This is a great question, but one that's tremendously difficult to succinctly answer, as it's subsumed under a whole panoply of scholarship in criminological history. (I’m sorry in advance for the confused structure of this post, but I typed a full response before the page accidentally refreshed, so I've had to rewrite this again.)\n\nAs a brief bibliographical aside, see Pieter Spierenburg's now-classic *The Spectacle of Suffering* for an overview on spectacular punishment. Although a little dated, it holds its place firm as a go-to in this historical field of public punishment in early modern to modern Europe, and deals with the decline in capital and other visual corporeal punishments, drawing on Foucault's seminal *Discipline and Punish* -- which charted the 18th- to 19th-century transition from the physical infliction of pain upon the criminal's body to judicial reforms increasingly preoccupied with rehabilitation via incarceration -- and Elias' state-centred *Civilizing Process*, with a few revisions. (His introduction has a good summary and criticisms on these two 'giants' of the topic.) On the pillory itself, there are too many to list, and it depends what your geographical interests are: John Beattie’s *Crime and the Courts in England* (1985) is frequently quoted for his descriptions of the pillory as the ‘paradigm’ of the era’s penal practice. A lot of other publications are journal articles behind paywalls, but if you do have access, see as just two examples McGowen, ‘From Pillory to Gallows: The Punishment of Forgery’ (1999) or Greene, ‘Public Secrets: Sodomy and the Pillory in the 18th Century’ (2003). (Those are completely arbitrary suggestions, by the way; there are many others, needless to say.)\n\nTo return to public penalties in general, there have been many possible answers proposed by historians and criminologists alike as to the causes of this growing antipathy to spectacular punishment. Squeamishness is one; others include the mounting control of the state, legal reformers' awareness of deterrence's failings, growing concerns for bodily integrity, and so forth. Some of these are problematic in their own respects. Shifts in elite sensibilities were not always concomitant with those of the lower classes when measured against continued popular attendance at executions during the 18th century, for instance. Others, like Foucault's narrative, have been found wanting; while discourses of pain and the body are important, for one, their dominance as causal factors might be reduced in favour of the sensibilities argument, since, as many have pointed out, *hiding* punishment did not necessitate its abolition. The death penalty is a notorious example of that, and I don't just mean in terms of the USA. (France's last guillotining was in 1977, for example.)\n\nIt becomes clear, then, that shame sanctions come under many similar if not always identical elements. But cultural aspects are also crucial: Ruth Benedict's shame cultures like Confucian-enshrouded China, as one example, or else Japan, might see these punishments extended simply because they hold more weight there than elsewhere -- although I hasten to add that I am not an expert on those societies, and they likely have substantially diverged in the cultural understandings of penalties, vis-à-vis European societies, over the past few centuries. And I've already mentioned how the focus on physically punishing the body, as opposed to other aspects of the penal system, has significantly altered over the years. In other words, the pillory was an interactive penalty: it allowed and indeed encouraged crowd participation more than most spectacular punishments. Yet it has to be read as part of a larger overarching narrative of punitive reform, whether interpreted through Foucault or otherwise, a process in which forms of punishment mutated as much as juridical aims did.\n\nLest we think the punitive value of shaming rituals has decreased, finally, it would be wise to remind of how much they've survived. As copious publications in law and criminological reviews point out, they persist today: see James Whitman on shame sanctions, notably (a free access version is available at _URL_1_), while media-shaming in the digital age is rampant, too, as others haven’t hesitated to note (_URL_2_). To that end, you might also be interested in more philosophical accounts of shame, e.g. Velleman’s ‘Genesis of Shame’ in *Philosophy  &  Public Affairs*, 2001 (public access at _URL_0_). \n\nThis is all rather disorganised, for which I apologise again, but hopefully it gives you a good idea of the general shift (to recap, around the mid 18th-beginning of the 19th centuries) in at least elite attitudes towards public punishment, as explained in various ways by different theorists; that shame is still very prevalent today as a method of punishment, and that its presentation has simply moved away from the corporeally-centred artefacts of the pillory and gallows of the past. Not that physicality is ever absent from our modern world: the Nazis frequently employed humiliation both in public and in concentration camps, including parading Jews through the streets with abusive signs hung from the necks, continuing a tradition prevalent almost everywhere in the world. And you don’t even have to look into such a radical example of 20th-century persecution to find instances of public shaming -- last year alone, in fact, Ukrainian soldiers were publically shamed by pro-Russian rebels in Donetsk via processions in front of mocking crowds (_URL_3_).

                "The Foreign Slave Trade Act of 1806 banned British subjects from trading slaves to, or on behalf of, foreign nations. This had the effect of reducing the British slave trade by so much because so much of the trade was with foreign nations and their colonies. \n\nPrior to this law, British slave traders could fly the US flag and trade with French colonies in the Caribbean (as well as the USA, South America, etc) despite Britain and France being at war. Passage of the law was seen as war measure (stop giving labor/aid to the French) rather than an abolition measure, which boosted support and aided in the Act being passed. \n\nOf course, once the law passed, British subjects could trade only with British colonies in the West Indies, which was a much smaller part of the market. Once the trade in slaves was dimished by so much, resistance to abolition of the trade as a whole rapidly decreased and the total abolition of the slave trade was passed less than a year later, in February 1807."

Yet not all would acknowledge it right away, and because the Duchy of Prussia was not as being as the large Prussian Region, Frederick I and Frederick William I styled themselves as Kings in Prussia, rather than Kings of Prussia. (In effect proclaiming the Duchy of Prussia to be a kingdom, but avoiding naming it the Kingdom of Prussia.)\n\nFormally, in one of the Treaties of Utrecht (the collection of which ended the War of the Spanish Succession), France acknowledged Frederick I as King in Prussia, and from there on it was essentially an established fact that he was King in Prussia.\n\nThis matches the general principle of the matter. Being treated as a king by foreign sovereigns was a matter of acknowledgment and tradition. For example, while the Russians intended for their Tsar to be considered equal to an Emperor in tank, and Peter I of Russia issued an edict to that effect, many other European powers refused to acknowledge the title as being more than the equivalent of a King, and over time this stuck, and the Russians Tsars started to incorporate titles like Tsar of Poland into their full style, thus effectively acknowledging the title Tsar to be equivalent to a king, or at least potentially so."

From this, we find that the first fall of Jerusalem (Jehoiachin deposed, Zedekiah installed as king) was on 16 March, 597BC. We don't have a direct Babylonian record for the second fall, but going with Jeremiah 52:6 tells us that Jerusalem fell in the summer of the 11th year of Zedekiah's reign, i.e., 587BC. This is consistent with the Babylonian chronology. Note that there was some debate as to how regnal years should be counted - different nations at the time used different system - so some (initially Thiele in the 1950s) have argued that the 11th year meant 586 instead, and you'll see this date in various sources. However, I think this has now been settled to everyone's satisfaction - or at least those who care about such things! I wasn't aware that anyone had put forward any alternative date, so would be interested in knowing where your 607 came from.     \n\nFinegan, Handbook of Biblical Chronology, discusses this issue at great length, particularly the issue of regnal years, and cites the relevant archaeological papers (mostly dating back to the 1950s).

Everything is checked and re-checked, which takes time.  \n\nAlso because it's about saving lives, we use the highest grade ingredients and tools (as required by the FDA, Health Canada, ISO, etc.), and that means, for example, importing tons of \"for-injection\" grade water from Europe, and that costs thousands, and the shipping for \"tons\" costs thousands.\n\nEverything is sent to a lab to test for sterility, contamination, etc., and that costs us thousands per day / lot.\n\nSo I'm looking at it here and not seeing greed or corruption, just high costs for the high quality that a patient's life demands.  You want \"sterile\", you get it, with all the guarantees that go along with that.  You want \"for injection\" because the device goes inside someone, you get it, with all the guarantees that go along.  The costs of the supplies and personnel required to manufacture at this level of quality is high.\n\nYour experiences with nurses and hospitals, those are really shitty hospitals and really bad people who should be thrown in jail for that kind of performance.\n\nMy personal experience with hospitals hasn't been great either, but the nurses and staff in the critical-care areas were highly paid, well trained, and very good at what they did.  When moved to the non-critical areas, though, they were less so, and I did see some cutting corners, lack of awareness of how they could contaminate their own gloves, and things like that, but they did their jobs as best they could.\n\nSo my conclusion is that it depends on costs, and what prices hospitals can charge based on the health care system.  Over here, the poor get poor (or no) treatment; over there, everyone seems to get poor treatment.\n\nI'm pretty sure this is not going to be a very popular reply, but I wanted to give you my personal observations.",
                "There is currently a doctor shortage everywhere in the world.   \nSchools reject the vast majority of applicants from matriculating.\n\nGoing to school in the Caribbean (usually the last opportunity one has to matriculate) will still set a student back $250k to $500k in debt for tuition and living. \n\nThese people need to pay off debt and make up for not earning money from the age of 18-30 while they are earning undergraduate degrees, (sometimes masters degrees), then medical degrees, followed by the abysmal pay for residents.  \n\n\nMedicine is a noble profession because one gives up their entire life to pursue this route, go massively into debt, enter a profession with a high suicide rate, and will die younger than the average person in their respective societies due to a lifetime of heavy stress.  \n\n\nResident surgeons can work up to two days straight before leaving the hospital.  \n\n\nThat is why we pay so much\n\n  \n"

                "There's a couple reasons as to why this is required, although keep in mind that most purposes with steel do not need to be completely radiation free. This type of steel is call Low-background Steel.\n\nOne reason as to why steel before the first atomic bombs is desired is due to the process of making steel. This involves blowing air into a furnace.  That air can be contaminated with radioactive dust from the nuclear detonations.  The dust can then become embedded in the steel, making it slightly radioactive. This is can be very bad for very sensitive equipment, for example, like Geiger counters.\n\nHowever, it is possible to produce new steel without the risk of radioactive dust by using a pure environment, it just costs more than the current production standards most companies use.\n\nDon't worry though, because background radiation levels peaked in the early 60s and have been declining ever since. So it is disappearing, but still there.\n\nEDIT: Gieger counters don't necessarily need Low-background steel, but it is preferred. Here is the [wiki](_URL_0_) about Low-background steel and what it could be used for.",

                "It's very difficult to get a good intuition for just how sensitive radiation measuring equipment can get. But it's frankly ridiculously so. Radiation measurements are a very versatile scientific tool, and the physics means it's possible to count single decay events. This leads to the slight problem that at that level *everything* is radioactive because we live on the detritus of titanic nuclear explosions (Supernovae)   Even the sunken steel isn't really ideal for instrumentation casing, it is just better than any practical alternative. ",
                "Simple. They cold roll the wreck steel and they have to make the new steel. The process of making the steel allows for these compounds to be absorbed to put it as simply as I can.

At my workplace, as much as 25% of each Heat of steel can be recycled scrap. \n\nA large amount of radioactive steel scrap was added to the European and Asian markets post Chernobyl. This scrap was used to make steel, which in many cases has itself now been recycled. Much of the world's supply of steel is thus now mildly radioactive.\n\nIn addition, some iron ore is naturally radioactive, as it shares the same ground as uranium ore.\n\nThis is kept under control by testing scrap, and testing the finished product for radiation.\n\nSource: I produce radiation certificates for steel exported to Asia and Europe.

                "So I'll avoid using the words \"common\" and \"uncommon\" because I don't have any statistics to show exactly how common it was for brothers to serve in the same unit. That being said, it was definitely a possibility mainly due to a German recruitment method known as \"primary grouping\". Primary grouping was the German attempt to install a sense of cohesion and loyalty in the German army. Under this system German soldiers would be drawn from roughly the same conscription zones (Wehrkriese). This meant that troops were trained and grouped roughly on a territorial basis; also when a man got injured he would most likely be returned to the same unit after he was recovered. The idea was to make soldiers see their unit as a second family and develop a sense of loyalty and camaraderie with their fellow soldiers and officers. This got harder to do at the divisional level and so was more of a platoon/company level occurrence. Now as the war dragged on an manpower got scarce these groups generally got broken up. A lot of historians used to point to this system of grouping as being of the German army's greatest strengths (and its destruction helped signal the end of the German army as a feared fighting force); but this view isn't all that common anymore. \n\nAnyways, so definitely two brothers fighting in the same unit was certainly possible; again I don't want to use common cause I don't have the statistics on hand (truth be told I'm not sure such statistics would exist in the first place). Sorry if this isn't exactly the answer you were looking for, but hopefully it helps shed some light on the situation."

                "Yes. Though typically commercial reactors become more difficult to control at low power levels ( < 10%). This has to do with fine control of the feed water system, usually.\n\nIn a commercial Pressurized Water Reactor (the type I'm most familiar with), reactor power basically follows the demand on the generator. If you're not familiar with reactor theory, it's somewhat complicated to explain why, but [this is a decent summary.](_URL_0_)\n\nNeutron moderators, such as control rods and boric acid, are then used to control the reaction rate. This maintains reactor coolant temperature (and therefore, fuel temperature) in a safe temperature range.\n\nTypically nuclear power plants are used as \"base load\" meaning they're always running at full capacity. There are a couple of reasons for this. It's partly because nuclear plants are cheaper to operate once running. It's also partly because startup/shutdown takes a long time vs. coal or gas plants (days vs. hours or minutes). So the fossil fuel plants are used as \"peaking power plants\" that run during peak hours. Summer afternoons when everyone is running their air conditioners, for instance.\n\n",
                "Nuclear engineer here.\n\nYour answer was answered pretty well by others, but some added info.\n\nWhenever a reactor core is reloaded, one of the critical parameters is the number of \"Effective Full Power Days\" (EFPD) worth of fuel the new core will have. 1 Effective full power day means that the reactor ran at 100% for a 24 hour period. Determining how many effective full power days you need is difficult for many reasons. You need to size the core's number of EFPDs so that you don't have enough fuel to make it to the end of cycle, but you also need to make sure if the plant scrams 2 or 3 times that you don't have so much excess fuel that it is getting wasted. Typically reactor cores are sized so that if you have a perfect run through the fuel cycle, the last couple weeks the core will slowly lose the ability to maintain full power, but if you have 1 or 2 scrams you won't have any excess fuel by the end of the cycle. \n\nIt is possible to load less fuel, for a lower EFPD, and plan on load following. Some plants like Columbia Generation Station nuclear plant will do this. They typically load follow in the late spring months, when there is a lot of wind, low power demand, and a lot of hydro (water runoff), and the nuclear plant is not needed all day. They size their core to account for this, and their nuclear plant will load following during these periods.\n\nMy plant has had to make a decision about when to do critical power grid maintenance. We chose to do it at a time when power prices are lower, which meant that later in the cycle, when power prices were higher, we still had enough fuel to maintain full power operation. \n\nTo conserve fuel, you simply lower reactor power. It's easy to do. Whenever you are below 100% power, you will use less than 1 EFPD of the core's fuel each day. It's possible to make that choice. Typically a plant will try and plan for it 1-2 years ahead of time, so that they pre-planned their fuel usage and don't have excess fuel or not enough. \n\nLowering power does reduce efficiency. Nuclear power plants have peak efficiency when they are at full power. At lower power levels, different effects such as lower feedwater heater temperature, less decay heat, etc, will reduce the efficiency of power production.\n\nIn the nuclear navy, the reactors are designed with a specific number of effective full power YEARS. Running at reduced power means that those reactors get longer lifes, and is part of the reason you can run over 20 years on a naval reactor (the other being the much higher initial fuel enrichment).\n\nAnyways, that's just some extra information."

                "I believe that this was something in one of Conn Iggulden's *Conqueror* novels, if memory serves correctly. A fun series and a good writer, but he takes a number of artistic decisions for the sake of story telling.\n\nGenerally speaking this sounds unlikely, being as Mongol families often accompanied the army on campaign, so there would not be a 'returning,' in quite that context. And when the sources are discussing the spoiled or lazy nature of Mongol rulers, one of the examples they often give is that they spent more time hunting than ruling. For instance, to depict Jochi (eldest son of Chinggis Khan) as lazy and to discredit his successors, after the fall of Gurganj in 1221 he said to have spent the rest of his life hunting in pro-Toluid sources (see Atwood, \"Jochi and the Early Campaigns,\" for more on this matter.) And Kublai Khan was famed for his hunting trips wherein he would sit on the back of four elephants lashed together (his gout being so bad, and him so obese that horse riding was likely very difficult for him as he aged) and shoot at animals released infront of him, as recorded in Marco Polo.\n\nAfter Temujin, the young Chinggis Khan, lost his father to Tatars and was abandoned by his tribe, he and his family were forced to survive *exclusively* hunting and gathering what they could, eating such things as mice, dogs, birds or even fishing. That sort of hunting was looked down upon by the Mongols, but generally had positive connotations and was an important means to sustain themselves alongside their herds.\n\nFurther, the Mongols and their successors never took to living, except part time, in palaces, commonly setting up *gers* (yurts in Turkish) in palace gardens or outside of the city. Ogedai Khaan, Chinggis Khan's successor, despite being famed for the construction of Karakorum in Mongolia spent little time living in the city itself, and such customs for the conquerors and their families continued well into the time of Timur and his descendant Babur. Which is not to say they never lived in palaces, but during the height of the united Mongol Empire (1206-1260) palace building and construction never common in Mongolia (though did take place, as not only Karakorum but a number of other small cities and palace like complexes were constructed by Chinggisids, particularly in the Orkhon area). \n\nHowever, there was, particularly as the 13th century wore on, problems with 'spoiled' princes, but our sources depict this more in line with alcoholism and greed than growing up with fine things.  It is notable that the maxims of Chinggis Khan which survive in the sources often relate to limiting alcohol consumption.\n\nIn the Yuan Dynasty (the Mongol Khanate in China and Mongolia ruled by Kublai Khan and his successors) the ruling court in Dadu (Khanbaliq, modern Beijing) was rather infamous for hedonism, the final Yuan ruler in China often said to have spent his long 3 decade reign distracted by women, alcohol and effectively everything but ruling, though its been shown that this was exaggerated to a large degree by later Chinese writers, and efforts to contrast them with the new Ming Dynastic founder, the Hongwu Emperor. Hongwu wanted to be shown as just, firm, not distracted by worldly distractions as the final Yuan rulers were. We also see throughout the Yuan Dynasty conflict between whether the Mongols should maintain their steppe customs and focus of the empire, using China's wealth for expanding the empire -associated with hunting, herding, livings in *gers* and the military- or adopt sedentary customs and focus on ruling the Chinese -associated with living in palaces, living in China. This was a serious conflict which often turned to armed violence and coups, and few Yuan emperors died natural deaths.\n\nIggulden's (if this was in fact from him, I do apologize if this is wrong, but I can't access my copies of his books right now) depiction of Mongol reactions to children spoiled by sedentary (generally, Chinese) customs does in fact reflect a serious problem which the Mongols faced being a softer life with sedentary aspects, or the leaner world of the steppe. But hunting as punishment seems unlikely. When we are in the period of Mongols being ''returning' from their campaigns to Mongolia (so, the period from 1209-1260), those sons were in all possibility on campaign alongside their fathers (conscription for military service started around 15), or taking roles in the maintenance of the herds and production of arms and armour for the warriors, which even with the influx of slaves and goods from the conquests still needed to be done. If anything, taking a year off for hunting would be a reward!\n\n & #x200B;\n\nSources:\n\nMorris Rossabi, *Kublai Khan: His Life and Times*\n\nTimothy May, *The Mongol Empire* (2018)\n\nChristopher Atwood, \"Jochi and the Early Campaigns,\"\n\n Frederick W.

                "At it's heart the assertion of no religion is an attempt to to justify the colonization of Taino lands under the guise of a \"just war\". Columbus was many things, but he wasn't so close-minded that he was unable to recognize a foreign belief system. The claim to a lack of religion, or notions of property, or innocence all worked to present new found lands as a just and easy conquest. The processes forged during the reconquest of the Iberian peninsula, and then tempered in the colonization of the Canary Islands, were unleashed with full force in the Caribbean. The same religious justification used for the *Reconquista* and the subjugation of the Canaries covered the many sins of colonization in it's early phases. Let me quote a bit from [an earlier post](_URL_0_), edited for our purposes here.\n\nDuring the exploration and conquest of the New World the Spanish crown sold licenses to explore/conquer/rule a specific region. *Adelantados* bore the cost of mounting the hazardous expeditions into the unknown, and successful invaders would gain from the production of their land, after the crown took it’s *quinto* (a fifth of spoils and taxes). The crown benefited substantially from selling these grants. Instead of devoting prohibitively expensive military resources to control land in the New World, these contracts placed the financial burden for territorial expansion on would-be *conquistadores*. The crown gained potential income from new lands, and contractually held the ability to regulate extremes of conquistador behavior if they failed to comply with the terms of the contract. Punishments for abuses or failure to act in a timely manner ranged from imprisonment, to substantial fines, or revoking the original license.\n\n*Adelantados* were therefore placed under extreme pressure to maintain the resources required for a successful *entrada*, establish a permanent base of operations, find something that made the new colony immediately economically viable to recoup their losses and continue to hold crown support (hence the preoccupation with precious metals), and convince the crown the local population posed no threat to their endeavors. Lobbying between *adelantados* and the crown often took years. For example, Juan de Oñate originally submitted a license to conquer New Mexico in 1595, petitioned repeatedly to lobby for contractual fulfillment when the license was revoked in 1597, and then engaged in a prolonged legal battle from 1606-1624 for use of excessive force during the *entrada*.\n\nPresenting their lands both worthy of conquest and easily conquered emerged as common theme for *adelantados* attempting to validate their position and maintain continued royal support. The formulaic writing style stressed not only a completely conquered native population, but one willing to submit both to Spanish rule and the Catholic faith, regardless of the actual facts on the ground. Hedged in religious terminology, and with papal support that acted as a divine grant of land for Castile and Portugal, “claims of possession became synonymous with possession itself” (Restall, p.68).\n\nThe claim of no religion justified the expansion into territory of those who had not yet heard the Gospel, and the Spanish Crown chose to interpret [a rather hazy 1493 papal bull](_URL_1_) as a right to complete political sovereignty. Queen Isabel stated, in 1501, that the vast number of inhabitants populating the New World were “subjects and vassals” and should “pay to us our tributes and rights”. Couched in these terms, Native American resistance to conquest became an unholy rebellion, and violent resistance an illegal infringement on colonial peace. Since *conquistadores* were fighting rebels against the crown and the Catholic faith, military campaigns were undertaken for pacification (not conquest). Since resistance leaders were rebels they could be tried and executed for treason, their followers legally enslaved for rebellion (despite the official ban on native slavery within the empire). I’ll quote Restall here because I can’t put it better…\n\n >  This pattern can be seen in the Yucatan as well as in virtually every region of Spanish America. Having founded a new colonial capital in 1542, named Mérida, the Spaniards in Yucatan declared the Conquest achieved and set about “pacifying” the peninsula. But as they controlled only a small corner of it, they were obliged to engage in major military hostilities with one Maya group after another, encountering particularly strong resistance in the northeast in the late 1540s. This was clearly an episode in a conquest war now in its third decade, but just as the Spaniards had already declared the Conquest complete so did they now classify this resistance as a rebellion… This was used to justify the execution of captives, the use of display violence (notably the hanging of women), and the enslaving of 2,000 Mayas of the region. Four centuries later, historians were still calling this “The Great Maya Revolt.” (p. 69)\n\nColumbus inherited the legal and religious justification for colonization of non-Catholics, and he, like many others, brought those rules of war to the New World in the search for gold and glory. He knew full well how to present his findings to the Crown to ensure further patronage, and there is a strong temptation to read his descriptions of Caribbean life as fact. We should always take care when reading these early accounts of the New World because, like in all of history, hidden under each word is the unspoken motivations of a biased narrator writing for their audience.\n\nCheck out Restall's *Seven Myths of the Spanish Conquest* for more info."

                "Firstly, people were definitely listening to the Beatles in Delhi in the 1960s. Their music was released in India in the 1960s through EMI's local branch; there are [pictures on Discogs of an Indian release of *Revolver*](_URL_3_) (the album 'Tomorrow Never Knows' is on), and I think discogs indicates that there were several pressings of the album in India. In fact, India is famous amongst Beatles nerds because, in the 1960s, Indian record labels were still releasing 78rpm records (which had been discontinued in England and America in the 1950s), likely for the section of the Indian market that still used hand-cranked gramophones; as a result, [Beatles singles up until 1968 were released on 78rpm in the Indian market](_URL_0_).\n\nAccording to a 2012 masters thesis by [Zachary Stockill at the University of British Columbia](_URL_2_), there was quite a lot of discussion of the Beatles in English-language Indian newspapers, but less in Hindi language newspapers; given that television had not yet arrived in India in the 1960s, according to Stockill, newspapers in the 1960s were a particularly prominent venue for cultural discussion.\n\nStockill makes the argument that, in English-language papers in India, the Beatles - and in particular, their association with the Hindustani classical musician Ravi Shankar - were seen through the perspective of a local debate about the importance of tradition; the Beatles were seen as the bringers of new ideas and the disrupters of tradition. It should be pointed out that the kind of music that Ravi Shankar made wasn't folk music, per se, but a kind of music with the prestige and tradition associated with Western classical music, and so the kind of music he played at, say, [the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967](_URL_1_), was a fairly traditionalist version of that music. However, Shankar's ambition and wanting to get in with the hip new Western hippie types meant that he was seen as someone pushing against traditions in Indian circles; Hindustani classical music was seen as a 'pure' vision of India that Shankar was letting 'foreign contamination' into.\n\nOf course, the Beatles in India have to be seen through the perspective the British Empire's long period of control over India, which had only ended barely 20 years before *Sgt Peppers* was released. The kind of people who'd read English-language newspapers in India were typically well-educated, more cosmopolitan types, who’d perhaps had more interaction with the Empire. Stockill claims that, due to budgetary deficiencies, English-language Indian newspapers of the time often relied heavily on reports from *The Times of London* or the *New York Times* (or Reuters), perhaps filtered with local commentary.\n\nAs a result of the reliance on big newspapers of the Anglosphere, readers of *The Times Of India*, for example, would have experienced plenty of coverage of the Beatles, who were covered extensively by the New York and London *Timeses*. Given their prominence, advertisers in English language Indian papers used Beatle references: \n\n > In March of 1968, an advertisement for a pharmaceutical company appearing in the Times of India bore the question: \"who wants tradition in the Beatle generation?\" The advertisers went on to explain that the reputable people at Hoescht Medicine do, as \"tradition sets a standard for the future. A standard of excellence.\"\n\nThe use of the Beatles in references in advertisement likely suggests that, amongst English-language Indians, they were household names.\n\nThere was also a vein of Indian social criticism which condemned trends associated with Western 'modernity' and 'their sneering attitude to the purity and sublimity of human character', of which the Beatles were a prime example, and a prominent one with their visit to Rishikesh in 1968. There was some suspicion about the Beatles' visit amongst some; one opposition Indian parliamentarian demanded an official inquiry, claiming in parliament that the Maharishi's ashram had become a centre of international espionage. Additionally, the Maharishi was generally seen in Indian society as something of a charlatan and the *Times Of India* wrote that he was \"easy to dismiss [as] poppycock\" due to the \"show business techniques\".\n\nHowever, there was also some celebration of the Western counterculture in Indian newspapers; George Harrison's engagement with Indian culture led him to be described in *The Times Of India* as \"the most knowledgeable of the fabulous foursome, and bubbling with initiative and drive\", while the Beatles' Rishikesh retreat, according to the *Hindustan Times*, provided India with \"perhaps the widest free tourist publicity that India had in the British press\". Conservative cultural values, argues Stockill, did predominate in such newspapers, but their arguments do suggest the existence of a progressive tradition that was taken with the Beatles; it's likely that the arguments in *The Times Of India* represented older generations, while younger generations - more likely to listen to the Beatles in the first place - made arguments about their music and their relevance to India in other avenues.\n\nA paper by Sharmadip Basu in *South Asian Popular Culture* points to the Calcutta-based magazine the *Junior Statesman* as a magazine more in the spirit of what youth were listening to; Basu quotes a reporter from the *Junior Statesman* as saying that *'we would review the very latest [music] from the West. We were the first in India to put the then ground-breaking Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's on the cover and review it extensively.'* The magazine also championed local versions of rock bands, often influenced by the late 1960s hippie bands like the Grateful Dead and Jefferson Airplane, including bands like The High and Great Bear; The High also based musical choices on hippie cultural touchstones, including releasing a *Tolkien Suite* based on the *Lord Of The Rings*."

                "I'm going to try and address your question within the context you specified to /u/cotton_eyed_bro below; if it's not what you're looking for, let me know and I'll try to refine my answer.\n\nYour question appears to be rooted in the assumption that the transatlantic slave trade was thriving until shortly before the civil war; this is not the case, and if the source you were reading implies that, I'm afraid you've been a bit misled. The United States had abolished the importing of slaves by federal law in 1807 (taking effect in 1808); Britain, which was responsible for as much as 28% of all slave cargo shipped to the United States after independence, abolished the trade in its entirety in the same year. Estimates on the extent to which illicit trading in slaves continued after 1807 have varied considerably, but the trade to America appears to largely disappear after 1820.\n\nIn the years just before the onset of the Civil War then, the transatlantic slave trade was for our intents and purposes dead; it was very much a permanent situation by that time. So in order to answer your question, I'm going to have to push your time-frame back a few decades to the turn of the century.\n\nGenerally speaking, the United States was never particularly hungry for slaves from Africa compared to the colonial holdings of the European powers. Between 1776 and 1808, continental North America imported approximately 123,000 slaves; in the same period, the Caribbean imported more than 1,520,000. To put it another way, for every slave arriving in the United States in that period, 12 were arriving in the Caribbean; 7 of those in the British Caribbean. Whilst it is important to note that America also imported slaves from the West Indies - and thus some of those slaves recorded as being Caribbean-bound ultimately ended up being sent on to continental North America - in any given year the USA rarely imported slaves on a comparable scale to the European colonies. The questions that arise from your initial inquiry are, then, how and why did the US end the foreign trade in slaves so early, and was the south a participant in or an obstacle to that process?\n\nThe answer to the first part of that question lies in the American war for independence. In the 25 years preceding the Declaration of Independence, records indicate that continental North America imported an average of 5,850 African slaves per calendar year; in the 25 years immediately after, that figure plummets to just 1,400. During the course of the American revolution, every part of the infant nation either outlawed or suspended the slave trade - some for moral reasons, some for fear that the instability of the period would make it harder to prevent slave rebellions (which, the slave-owning community believed, were more likely to originate from African than colonial-born slaves) and others out of a desire to undermine or separate from the British economy.\n\nThe demand for fresh slave labour was still as strong as ever, however. In the absence of imports from the rest of the world, the USA began to develop a much stronger *internal* slave trade, redistributing its internal supply of slaves through market processes or relocation between states. Such trade had always existed and served to reduce the demand for foreign imports of slaves, but the closing of US ports to slave ships placed greater emphasis on its importance. From 1790 to 1860, around one million slaves were probably sold and moved through this internal market - probably more than double the number of Africans brought to continental North America in the 230 years slavery existed there. After the war, most states kept or only fleetingly lifted their bans on the slave trade; Georgia alone had permanently restored the trade by the 1787 Constitutional convention. Nonetheless, the planters of the Lower South as a whole felt importing slaves from abroad was a right to which they were entitled, and a means by which they could ensure the future of slavery in the long-term if the domestic trade became unsustainable or too costly. As a concession to them, the Constitution guaranteed states the right to import slaves until 1808 if they wanted to do so.\n\nIn 1805, with the constitutional protection for the trade about to expire, anti-trade representatives in Congress began to work towards securing abolition to take effect on the earliest possible date: January 1st, 1808. In these debates, the south's leaders and representatives divided. The Upper South and especially Virginia had developed a strong excess of slaves, and there were serious concerns about the implications of this among contemporaries for Virginian society and economy. In contrast, the Lower South - with its rapidly growing cotton industry always hungry for more labour - had a constant need for new slaves. It was this labour imbalance that had fuelled the growth of the internal slave trade already, with labour moving from the Upper to the Lower South when the international market could not provide enough. Furthermore, South Carolina had re-opened its ports to slave imports in 1803; this served as a phenomenal boost to the slave trade. In 1804 alone, the US imported more slaves than it had in the preceding seven years combined; most of these slaves were sold on beyond South Carolina, creating a rival source of new labour to the internal trade.\n\nThe moral climate of the wider US was also favourable to abolition - even among pro-slavery elements of society, the horrors of the slave trade were difficult to deny. Congress had repeatedly passed measures aimed at regulating and restricting the practicalities of the slave trade with mixed success; the mass imports to South Carolina after 1803 had highlighted the inadequacies of these measures and strengthened the case for federal abolition.\n\nUltimately, the slave trade could not survive; many in the Upper South had a vested interest in its demise to promote the domestic slave trade, many northern abolitionists hoped to end slavery altogether by choking off the supply of new slaves, and the planters of the Lower South could not make a convincing economic or moral argument for its retention.\n\nIn the final years of the trade, after South Carolina re-opened her ports to slaves and abolition of the trade approached, the US experienced an unprecedented burst in new slave imports. In 1807 alone, more than 35,000 slaves arrived from Africa in the United States - all in all, the years 1803 to 1808 account for nearly 65% of all known estimated slave imports in post-independence America. Around one in every six Africans taken directly to the USA as slaves from 1628 to 1860 - a period of 232 years - are thought to have arrived there in the final half-decade of the slave trade's legal existence. In other words, a period amounting to just 2% of slavery's existence accounted for 15 - 20% of all foreign slave imports.\n\nThis burst in imports at the last minute, a supply of labour sufficient to account for anywhere between 25 - 35 years of lost external trade, surely gave southern slavery the boost it would need to adapt to the total loss of the legal foreign slave trade. When the southern states seceded from the union, restoring the slave trade was not in their minds - indeed, the Confederate constitution prohibited the \"importation of negroes of the African race from any foreign country\", except for the USA, though there were certainly many in the south hotly opposed to this provision (and some who only accepted it for fear the Confederacy could not find international support without it). \n\nIn terms of the feasibility of restoring the transatlantic slave trade, that is difficult to say. The slave trade was in global decline at this point anyway, and after 1850 was predominantly the domain of the Spanish, who had only ever accounted for a tiny portion of shipments to North America. With the USA, Britain and France all prohibiting slavery, I imagine that the Confederacy would have had an enormously difficulty time meaningfully reinstating it. Though some certainly wanted to, it is likely that the southern US would have always been much more dependent upon continuing to trade internally rather than importing Africans.\n\n**TL;DR: The trade's abolition took place a long time before the civil war. The south came to rely on an internal market for slaves, whereby excess labour in the Upper South was sold on to the Lower South for profit. Though Lower South planters resisted a ban on the trade to try and keep labour costs down and the supply high, Upper South interests in promoting a domestic trade and northern anti-slavery interests restricted their capacity to resist the outlawing of slave imports from Africa. By the time of the Civil War, the south's prospects for restoring the trade even if they won were poor, and though some certainly wanted to, the Confederate Constitution did outlaw the trade.**\n\n**Selected Bibliography**\n\n* David Brion Davis, *The Problem of Slavery in the Age of Revolution, 1770 - 1823* (1975).\n* Matthew E.

                "During the period of the Eastern Roman Empire, the Crimean territory served as a critical trade post for the northern Black Sea, but also served a crucial secondary purpose as a forward lookout position for any of the various warlike migratory tribes that would be making their way west or south towards the Empire. Grand Prince Vladimir I of Kiev took the major city of Chersonesos in Crimea hostage in 988 to force Emperor Basil II to not renege on his agreement to wed his sister Anna to the Grand Prince, after the latter helped him put down a revolt the prior year. Considering that an imperial princess had never been wed to a foreigner before this point and Basil ended up agreeing to the marriage after the takeover, you can imagine how important this strategic province was to the Empire (although this ended up with a welcome side-purpose of finalizing Vladimir's conversion to the Orthodox Church, followed swiftly by the rest of his people).\n\nSource: J.J. Norwich, \"History of Byzantium\"",
                "During the Classical period, the region was called Chersonesus, which was also the main city. Its history as a Greek colony stretches back into the classical or late Archaic, founded as part of the general movement of Greeks around the Mediterranean, and it came into the Roman orbit during the process of the Roman conquest of the interior of Asia Minor. It was never really under full control of the Romans, but had had a fairly long history of trading some of its sovereignty in exchange for protection from its troublesome northern frontier. During the third century it capitulated to the Goths and was a major source of their naval power.\n\nThe inhabitants were Greek colonists, but the Black Sea Greek colonies in general tended to be very heavily mixed with the \"indigenous\" populations. Economically, it was a very fertile agricultural region and major exporter of grain."

                "One of the main jobs for your vascular system is to regulate the body temperature. Putting something cool around your neck can cool the blood inside the vein and then rapidly travel around the body. Like pipes that have hot water to act as water heating, there's a heat exchange between the cooler blood and higher temperatures of the body.\n\nEdit: Wow one of those sentences made no sense...",
                "Great question! I would say yes that can indeed cool you down.\n\nSo, essentially this directly relates to how your body cools down naturally. When you are too hot your body begins to sweat and because water has a high specific heat capacity, it creates a cooling effect (it takes a lot of heat from your body to evaporate the sweat). Your blood vessels also dilate when this happens, so that more blood will pass by the areas of your body that are sweating and experiencing the cooling effect. This is important because the core temperature of your body is what needs to be decreased and the peripheral areas of your body is what usually does the cooling.\n\nIf you put ice directly near a jugular vein, it will create the same effect as sweating - in that it provides an area of cooling that is near blood vessels which is going to and from the core of your body.",
                "Better off putting a cool cloth around your radial artery (wrist). At least, according to my medi-vac EMR instructor anyways.",
                "While it will cool you a tiny bit, the amount of cooling done is really insignificant.  Most of it is in your head.\n\nThere has been a decent amount of research done on this, mostly in the areas of hyperthermia/heat stroke treatment.  That being said, it is still slightly contentious.   [This chart](_URL_0_) from [this article](_URL_1_) give a good overview of extremity cooling, which has been found to more effective than artery cooling.\n\nBasically, the best way to meaningfully cool off is to jump in an ice bath.  After that, the best way is to submerge hands, feet, and faces.  These are highly vascular, and actually are much more effective than cooling on an artery.  So your cool towel, though it will probably feel nice, won't actually do that much.",
                "Yes it is a very effective cooling method. In fact, nature has already figured this out. Kangaroos like their blood vessel-rich wrists to cool down via evaporation."

                "Intuitionist logic is primarily a framework for constructive mathematics. The idea is to avoid non-constructive proofs, e.g. a proof that establishes \"there exists an object with property P\" but does not provide any way to actually identify such an object. \n\nFormal logic is a set of syntax rules describing which statements are proved from other statements. Every rule must be explicitly stated. Double negation elimination (\"not not A\" proves \"A\") is one of them, another is the law of excluded middle (\"A or not A\" is true). These two in particular tend to lead to non-constructive proofs when used. \n\nBy removing these rules, mathematicians using intuitionist logic are simply exploring what can be proved without them. \n\nEDIT: To answer your question directly, the statement \"not not A\" can be true in intuitionist logic. It is just treated as distinct from saying \"A\" is true. \"Not not A\" is its own thing. \n\nThat is as far as mathematics goes. If you want to talk about whether statements about non-mathematical objects obey double negation elimination, or about what it means for \"not not A\" and \"A\" to be non-equivalent, then that is more in the area of philosophy. It is a very interesting discussion, but I don't know enough to say anything authoritatively. ",
                "In classical logic, you can prove that not (not a) is equivalent to a by splitting the proof into two cases: either a is true or it is false. If it is true, then not (not a) = a. If it is false, then not (not a) = a. Therefore, not (not a) = a for any a.\n\nThis proof uses law of excluded middle (\"either a is true or a is false\"). In isolationistic logic, this principle is not assumed. (The negation of this principle is not assumed, either)\n\nEvery intuitionistic proof is a classical proof - it's just a proof that doesn't use excluded middle. It is harder to prove things this way, but, in return, you can extract constructions from proofs. For example, an intuitionistic proof that \"exists A such that f(A)\" must show an explicit A, while a classical proof might just show that nonexistence of A leads to contradiction, without giving any idea how the A satisfying f(A) looks like. Consider the statement that the set of primes is infinite - \"for every m, there is n such that n > m and n is prime\". This corresponds to a computer program that takes m and returns n such that n is prime and n > m. This is why law of excluded middle is not allowed as an axiom - it does not say which of the two options (A is true or A is false) holds. You can prove intuitionistically that every two natural numbers n,m are either equal or different (there's an algorithm for that); but you cannot prove that every Turing machine halts or not (halting problem is undecidable).\n\nFor more, take a look at \"Five stages of accepting constructive mathematics\" by Andrej Bauer.",
                "Intuitionist logic is not saying that not (not A)  < =/= >  A. Rather, it's saying that it doesn't care whether A or not A.\n\nIn intuitionist logic, you're not interested in what's true and what's false, you're interested in what you can construct. Consider the question of whether a certain object exists. In standard logic, you can prove that an object exists by building that object, but you can also prove that it exists indirectly, by proving it's not true that it doesn't exist. However, in intuitionist logic, we're only interested in proofs which tell us not only that the object exists, but also how to get it.\n\nFor example, in standard logic, you can prove that there is a digit which shows up an infinite number of times in the decimals of Pi. It's very easy : suppose there isn't such a digit. Then all ten digits show up a finite number of times, so there are only a finite number of digits, and that's not the case. Therefore such a digit exists. In Intuitionist logic, however, you want to actually find that digit. Until you've found a proof which lets you say \"7 shows up an infinite number of times\", you haven't proved the existence of such a digit."

You might argue that at the singularity time stops, but it is a singularity so we don't know what happens there.\n\nMoreover black holes evaporate in finite time. So inside the black hole you cannot see events that happen after the black hole disappears.\n\nNeil degrasse is confused as many people are by the fact that an external observer perceives that time seems to stop at the event horizon. \n\n1. Time is how we structure causality, before and after. Things inside the black hole cannot affect events outside, so there is no causal relationship between the inside and the outside and thus no before and after from inside to outside.\n\n2. What we perceive is what we see, and is mediated by photons traveling back. They can be delayed or distorted. A recent article talked about a supernova in a distant galaxy that could be observed multiple timed because of gravitational lensing. But it didn't happen multiple times, it happened once, we were just watching reruns. Another analogy is that when you send postcards from a vacation trip they are often delivered after you return.

Your personal clock will slow significantly compared to an outside observer as you approach a black hole. With an idealised telescope you could witness the evolution of civilisations, stars, and even galaxies while in the vicinity of the event horizon. \n\nHowever the lorentz transformation still applies, simply put, the number of events you can observe is still very limited, even more so as your light-cone [a bit like a personal timeline] is tilted towards the singularity. The absolute limit to what you observe will be defined by the area encompassed by your light-cone, and that area won't encompass all future events in the universe. \n\nSo the quote is not entirely correct, you won't see the *entire* universe unfold. You will get an opportunity to see a lot more of the universes events than an outside observer would in their lifetime. \n\nEDIT:\n\nFor rotating black holes Kerr's solution for Einstein's field equations suggest that it is possible to exit the black hole before encountering the singularity. If Kerr's solution is correct then a Kerr black hole will allow you to time travel.

                "Well I can't find anything on ammunition, but I can tell you a bit about airplanes.\n\nTowards the end of the war the Luftwaffe needed an emergency fighter.  The [Heinkel 162 Salamander](_URL_2_) won out.  The idea of the Emergency Fighter Program was to mass produce a wonder weapon that was cheap.  That's basically what the 162 was.  The Me-262 jet fighter was very expensive for the Germans to build or find replacement parts for.  So aside from the jet engine the 162 was designed to be made out of wood.  The A-2 was the most produced variant, which had 2x20mm cannons in the nose.  They had originally placed 30mm cannons in the nose but this broke the plane.  The plane had to be built in mass quantities because it was designed to be replaced instead of repaired.  The 262 was needed as well.  The germans had to find a way of keeping the production away from the bombers.  The [Mauthausen-Gusen Concentration Camp in Austria](_URL_1_) famously dug tunnels to build the airplanes on a mass scale.  [The tunnels were very large](_URL_0_).  Keep in mind that at the end of the war Germany was still pretty large.  The allied forces had pretty much zeroed in on Berlin by that point and somewhat ignored the rest of the empire.  Keep in mind I am _NOT_ saying they didn't have battles there, just that the main objective was to capture Berlin.  There were still scores of factories across the countryside.  Also the constant bombing of cities never really permanently destroyed factories.  The Siege of Leningrad is a great example of this.  I can provide sources if you would like but as it stands this is greatly off of memory.",
                "The short answer is that the German war economy was in a state of collapse by 1945. The efforts of Speer had led to the peak of German armaments production in mid-1944, these efforts had reached their limits. Pressures for manpower, ersatz materials, rationalization, and the air attacks on the near entirety of German territory meant that the herculean efforts of 1944 could not be repeated the following year. \n\nEven the numbers of finished weapons produced are deceptive. For example, both Hitler and Goering placed great stock in locating strategic factories underground in caves in 1943/44. Although these underground complexes stimulated the imagination, they were unsuitable for large-scale industrial production. The need for a large floorspace quickly meant that these underground complexes favored soft rock systems, which meant dust often fouled machinery or damaged sensitive parts such as aircraft instruments. Poor ventilation not only made these underground factories insufferably hot, it also led to a build up of humidity that further damaged both the factory tools and the finished product. Ersatz materials also degraded the finished quality of weapons produced. Jet engines like the Jumo 004 required metals alloys able to withstand high-temperatures, but these were in short supply in 1944/45. Junkers's expedient solution was to use steel coated with an aluminum paste, which provided allowed the *Luftwaffe* to field the Jumo 004, but the result was a very short engine lifespan. The result was that many of the fabled German jets often sat idle not only for want of fuel, but engines as well. Shortages of brass led to the substitution of lacquered steel for small-arms ammunition, which often had a tendency to split when fired, thus damaging the gun. Shortages in molybdenum meant that tank armor was often more brittle and prone to fracturing. This meant that in addition to a decline in quantity, German armaments witnessed a severe decline quality as well. The German war economy had managed to stave off complete collapse in 1944, but Speer's drive for efficiency and rationalization created new problems that could not be surmounted in the worsening conditions of 1945.      \n\nBut most damning to the German war effort was the near complete collapse of the German transportation network that precipitated a near collapse of the German war economy. The loss of air superiority and encroaching allied armies destroyed rail hubs, rolling stock, and cut Germany off from supplies of raw materials to keep the trains rolling. Speer realized this danger and instituted the directive \"industrial supplying of the troops\" in late 1944 after a tour of the front, which was a pretty commonsensical directive. In short, Speer directed that local war industry should be responsible for local defense needs. War production would continue to supply the front until the last moment and the Reich will only evacuate  strategic factories. Speer was abetted in this effort by various German industrialists who saw the writing on the wall and wished to preserve what remained of German industry for a postwar order. \n\nAs German armies fell back onto the Reich, they also had the benefit of operating on their own bases and supply dumps. While severely depleted and under-supplied, retreat had the dubious benefit of lessening the logistical burden on German formation as they moved closer to their supplies. Captured stockpiles of enemy ammunition and weaponry from the heady days of German military successes also helped plug in the gaps that German-produced stocks could not fill. However, these were all temporary solutions. The Battle for Germany reflected this last-ditch breathing space; pockets of German defenders were able to put of a very ferocious defense initially, but were immobile. Their inability to resupply meant such resistance was sharp, but short-lived. These pockets had two option, either surrender or fight on ineffectively with its dwindling stocks of weapons and ammunition. \n\n*Sources*\n\nKershaw, Ian. *The End The Defiance and Destruction of Hitler's Germany, 1944-1945*.

The satellite is moving on a straight line in spacetime, but spacetime is curved in such a way that that straight line actually winds around the planet in a circle. As no actual force is acting on it, it cannot measure any. It is not necessarily true anymore that \"changing velocity requires so and so acceleration\", because these are statements that were proven using flat geometry and Newtonian mechanics.",
                "Almost none.\n\nOne Newtonian way to think about it as a balance of forces is to consider that the force of gravity and the initial velocity of the object cause it to move in a curved orbit around the earth. But in it's own reference frame, which is accelerating with respect to the \"universal reference frame\", there will be a fictitious force, the centrifugal force. It will exactly counteract gravity because fictitious forces are a measure of deviation of Newton's first law. The trajectory of the satellite ( which is accelerated with respect to the universal reference frame) will cause a deviation in Newton's first Law in the reference frame of the satellite. Naturally, the deviation (centrifugal force) will be equal and opposite to the force causing it (gravity). So the two cancel for the satellite.\n\nGeneral Relativity has a better explanation. Freely falling reference frames are inertial. No forces act upon them (except for the local curvature of space time in those reference frames which will be seen as a tidal force). The trajectory is curved because spacetime, being curved by mass/energy density, has curved inertial trajectories. The almost comes from the tidal forces the object feels because the spacetime which it inhabits is curved, but only slightly for mass/energy densities comparable to earth."

        "selftext": "I was listening to a TED talk when I heard something fascinating: apparently, cancer patients were merely told that they were taking chemotherapy, when in fact they took a placebo, and their hair started falling out. I looked it up for verification, and I did find other references to this phenomenon... but all of them had something in common.\n\nGoogle result #1 was _URL_2_, titled \"The Twisted Truth About the Nocebo Effect.\" In the fifth paragraph, a book is referenced, which allegedly refers back to a study which records that patients given a chemotherapy placebo had their hair fall out. And then, **immediately**, the article shifts to \"how to avoid the nocebo effect,\" as if it's now a given.\n\nGoogle result #2 was _URL_1_. It starts out talking about the power of placebos, **evidences its point just by referencing those same study results**, then goes on to say...\n\n'So if the power of the mind is strong enough to make our hair fall out when taking a placebo, what do you think happens when we think to ourselves “This cake is fattening.  I really shouldn’t be eating it,” or “I’m going to eat this fried chicken but I know it’s bad for me,” or “I enjoy eating my salad because it’s really healthy”?'\n\nas an immediate conclusion.\n\nOn and on it goes. As I skim through the results, I see diet regimens, watered-down pop science, and mainstream articles about this topic, but nothing that strikes me as rigorously critical or explicative. Why?\n\nThe original TED talk that inspired this search (_URL_0_) also draws an immediate proposition, one that sounds FAR more \"new-agey,\" that healthcare providers need to focus on \"healing\" and that their vaguely nurturing nature or lack thereof contributes to these results, implicitly (I think) through that same psychological mechanism. And, sure, they reference further studies to that effect, but even if **that** proposition were true it would open up 15 gaping questions that are completely vaulted over to make vague points. Personally, I find the idea of the placebo hair effect fascinating, but our almost unanimous reaction to it is almost just as fascinating as to what it says about us.\n\nI have no reason to assume that that study is false, and let's just say it's not being misinterpreted. **WHY** are we defaulting to either sagely advice or vague, new-agey philosophies in response to what seems to be a genuinely revolutionary scientific discovery? It doesn't surprise me that people would do that, but it does surprise me that discussion on that study would be so utterly dominated by this kind of thing. Where are the articles, the truly analytical videos, the lists of new vocabulary terms, the bare-bone facts and the long, no-nonsense theories about why this phenomenon takes place? This proposition sounds earth-shattering in a way that needs to be explained thoroughly in a rational, mechanical way, like if we discovered we could stop our hearts through strong concentration or remove freckles by thinking about the color blue, but for some reason it seems to have been passed over. It blows a hole in at least the popular understanding of how our bodies work, and when it blows that hole, most people somehow take it in stride and then accept a vague principle assumption because of it without much further inquiry. This makes me think of several possibilities...\n\n* The study itself (and accompanying evidence) is inconclusive, not very much reliable evidence exists, and it's all being grossly overblown.\n* The study itself doesn't, in fact, say the things people claim it does.\n* The study wasn't credible or had key errors associated with it. (For example, maybe patients could've lost their hair for other reasons, or maybe hair loss is simply a characteristic of extreme stress already associated with having cancer.)\n\nOR...\n\n* The study DID blow a hole in our understanding of human physiology, and there ARE sound studies out there that create a framework as to why the body would so feverishly respond to human thoughts even to its own possible detriment, but they are not widely known or understood or circulated on the Internet.\n* The human brain is just too complicated a beast for us to even begin sound inquiry on this subject that would give us reliable conclusions, even though its implications seem to shatter our understanding of how the mind relates to the body.\n\nTo those well-versed in the relevant science: how right or wrong am I? Is there something wonky with the study or our interpretation of it, or is it not unheard of for something this remarkable to be staring us in the face but not get the inquiry and scientific attention it deserves?\n\n**EDIT:** Let me clarify: I don't dispute that the \"nocebo\" effect exists, at least as far as moment-to-moment perceptions go. But for it to actually alter involuntary bodily processes like hair growth enough to literally make someone go bald, I think there has to be something more to this particular issue that raises questions about the study or our reaction to it.",

                "There have indeed been studies on the nocebo effect - [this one from 1996] (_URL_0_), for example, in which patients were told they were being given something that would temporarily increase the pain they were in after an operation. They were actually given harmless saline, but their pain did indeed increase (the nocebo effect). Adding small amounts of a substance called proglumide stopped the nocebo effect. (Proglumide is an opioid which improves response to painkillers but is not a painkiller itself.) \n\nIn other words, the nocebo effect appears to be real and has a chemical basis. I didn't think the effect itself was that controversial, to be honest. ",
                "This might be a better question for r/askscience as you've hit on a few pretty big questions. \n\nBasically, the placebo effect is about as firmly established as a psychological phenomenon can get, nobody really disputes that it exists.  The nocebo effect is the same thing, except you feel worse, not better, so it's not really a \"new\" thing that needs a ton of evidence to be accepted as real.  It's interesting that it \"works in reverse\" but it stands to reason that if the power of suggestion can make you feel better (or actually get better) then it could do harm, as well. \n\nAs far as people overblowing the effects and coming up with all kinds of pseudo-science, new-agey, armchair nutritonist crap based on one study - welcome to literally any popular coverage of a study that implies it could help you lose weight.  It's really common for bloggers to read the abstract of one study (or even a news article about the study without even reading the study) and then go off to the races will all kinds of fantastical ideas about what they think the implications are.  As you note, the study doesn't even have to be real for this to happen, [one guy deliberately came up with a BS study and popularized it, to show exactly how rampant this problem is](_URL_0_).\n\nThird thing that you hit on - how the placebo (or nocebo) effect works is not fully understood on a physical level.  It's been studied a lot but AFAIK nobody knows exactly how it works.  As you note, the human brain/mind and how it works is far from fully understood by science. \n\n4th point - TED talks tend to overblow and oversimplify science, because the goal of a TED talk is to make a Gladwell-esque pronouncement that upends the audience's worldview with one amazing clickbait idea that will change your life, blah blah blah.  The tendency is to try and explain huge, complex things with soundbites.  Usually the science or idea is somewhat sound, but then is stretched to the limit to make it seem super-impressive and world-saving/changing. ",
                " >  On and on it goes. As I skim through the results, I see diet regimens, watered-down pop science, and mainstream articles about this topic, but nothing that strikes me as rigorously critical or explicative. Why?\n\nBecause you don't know how to search for rigorously critical stuff.\n\nIf you want to search the scholarly literature (which is at least more likely to be rigorously critical, if far from assured), use something that does that, like _URL_0_ or _URL_1_\n\nThere is lots of actual research out there.  But if you want stuff that is rigorously critical, you have to work for it.\n\n >  I have no reason to assume that that study is false, and let's just say it's not being misinterpreted. WHY are we defaulting to either sagely advice or vague, new-agey philosophies in response to what seems to be a genuinely revolutionary scientific discovery?\n\nThere is no \"we\" here.  You did a few poorly conducted internet searches, and you found what you found.  \n\nAlso, this is not so terribly earth shattering in the first place.  It is interesting, sure, but there is a lot of interesting stuff.  And most of it is easier to conduct research on than this.  You can't just run around lying to people and making their hair fall out for your curiosity and amusement.  Even if you argue that it will probably eventually lead to discoveries that eventually help people, that is a bit speculative and indirect to meet beneficence standards.  Look for papers from Italy, which is (or at least was) a bit more free about such things."

                "If instead of a force, you use an object with some momentum, you can solve the problem by writing expressions for linear and angular momentum and keeping them constant during the collision. The motion of the center of mass and the rotation about that center can be considered separately. \n\nDoes the force change direction with the rotation of the ship? If it does, then finding rotation is easy but finding linear motion is hard, but if the force doesn't move then both are easy. \n\nForces change angular momentum by applying torque, or force around the axis. If **r** is the vector from the center of mass to the point you're pushing, and **f** is the force vector, then torque is **f**x**r** or f\\*r\\*sin(angle between the vectors). Torque times time will give you a change in angular momentum.\n\nIf the force doesn't change direction, then the change in momentum of the center of mass will be force\\*time. If it does, you'll have to deal with that. \n\nIn any case, you'll need to consider momentum as both x and y values, and you can treat angular momentum as 1 value for a 2d object. \n\nThis is how objects work all the time, gravity is just another force.

The thermal jackets you find in survival kits effectively are designed to reflect IR but keep in mind if you're reflecting it from your body, you're also keeping your body from radiating its own heat. I did the research a while ago but what I can recall, 1/3 - 1/2 of your body's cooling is from radiation. \n\nAlso, higher frequencies of light still add energy to your body (hence why greenhouses work). This is why you'll see white being used for clothing in some middle eastern countries, which is the practical way to use your proposed concept.\n\n",
                "Many firefighters wear reflective Mylar \"spacesuits\" to reflect heat.  They are very effective at reflecting radiated heat over the short term, although eventually heat is transferred by convection and contact.  Those suits also trap the body's own heat and tend to warm up.\n\nAlso, if you were in an area like the desert, with high radiation (lots of sunlight) and low convection (low humidity) then an IR reflecting garment can be very effective.  This is why traditional dress in the middle-east often include turbans and light-colored robes that cover the whole body.",

But if you look at it with a camera that only sees infrared, it would appear white.\n\nI have such a camera, and it was very interesting to look at my black clothes with it. Some of it was black, some of it was white.\n\nSo to answer your first question: Yes, it is possible, even by accident.",
                "This sounds like a classic grade-school misconception, that infrared light is actually made of heat, or is a form of heat.   Uh, no.  The books that teach this are wrong.  The source of the misconception is obvious: when invisible light shines on your skin, you feel warm.  If you weren't familiar with the physics, you might conclude that invisible IR light was made of heat.  Hold your hand near an electric heater, and apparently \"heat rays\" will warm your skin.  Wrong, because the same thing happens when UV light shines on your skin, or visible light, or microwaves.   In other words, all EM radiation is, in the language of those grade school books, \"a form of radiant heat.\"\n\nAs to your question: the wattage in sunlight is roughly half in the visible spectrum, and half in the near-infrared.   If your shirt only reflected IR light, it wouldn't work near as well as a metallized shirt which reflected everything.\n\nAnd as just_commenting points out, such a shirt would reflect your own thermal-IR back to your body again.  I would be like sitting inside an aluminum-foil oven.\n\nSomewhat OT: does anyone know why desert tribes wear black robes?  Maybe the cooling from the convective plume triggered by the hot cloth outweighs the radiation heating from wearing hot cloth?   Or maybe if all your colleagues were wearing blazing white clothes in the Sahara, you'd all need UV-opaque Eskimo goggles to avoid rapid cornea damage (UV snow blindness.)\n",

This didn't work out well, as they were a pain in the ass to wash and they made the whole workspace very bright.  Someone, who was very intelligent and had a knowledge of the color-wheel, suggested that scrubs be made in the now notorious green-blue.  This is because it is on the opposite side of the color-wheel from bright red, which is the color of blood.  In turn, the scrubs color would absorb the color of the blood and make the patient and the workspace a more visibly pleasing area.  \n\nJust thought I would throw in some extra facts for the day.  Carry on!",
                "For all practical purposes, there are two types of infrared energy, thermal infrared and near(red)-infrared. Thermal infrared is the energy that you can feel as heat. Near-infrared is the one emitted from light sources such as a remote control. What makes different colored fabrics feel hotter is their capacity to adsorb(not reflect) light. So your blue shirt is adsorbing everything but blue light rays and the green shirt is adsorbing everything (IR, red, blue, UV) but green light. When a pigment adsorbs light energy it gets converted into heat energy(thermal IR).  \nGiven a white light source, a red shirt will feel hotter than a blue shirt because the blue pigment is reflecting the part of the spectrum that has the most energy and adsorbing just the weaker wavelengths. A red pigment does the inverse. A white shirt will do best at reflecting all the colors of the spectrum and will convert the least amount of light into heat. Washing your whites with a detergent labeled for \"brighter whites\" will also help reflect a lot of the near-infrared light. Synthetic clothes generally reflect more IR than cotton.  IR reflectivity is a big issue to consider in tactical situations as IR goggles might make camouflage clothing stick out like a sore thumb. Fabrics with special IR dyes also exist to take care of that. \n\nTLDR. Use a white synthetic long sleeve shirt and keep it clean.",
                "It is called \"A white shirt\" and I'm not being sarcastic.\n\nLight colored clothing is cooler in the summer because it reflects most of the light hitting it ( including infrared ).\n\nMylar is also an excellent infrared reflector ...too good actually since it would reflect your own body heat back at you.\n\nNow a one-way infrared mirror ,while interesting, is in the category of \"science fiction\" (the \"not in our lifetime\" kind of science fiction. )\n\n",
                "This is what white shirts are. They reflect visible light and infrared too. Its cooler with a white shirt on. The brighter the cooler.\n\nThere are tricks with multiple layers, wicking, transpiration and reflective panels but any tennis outfit has a lot of this type of thing built in. Manufacturers pay attention to the absorption coefficients in the infrared spectrum.\n\nSomething that reflects infrared also blocks it from emitting, so  like an igloo the inside of a shirt can become a mirror to reflect heat inward."

                "I can't answer when it was first referred to as the subcontinent, but I can tell you it has absolutely nothing to do with continental drift.\n\nIt's not called the \"subcontinent\" because it happens to sit on a separate continental plate that crashed into Asia 40 million years ago. It's called that because of the *results* of that collision, which are apparent entirely in the topography (and to a lesser extent, vegetation).\n\nIf you look [at a relief map of the subcontinent](_URL_0_), you can see that it is almost entirely walled off from the rest of Asia. There are only a few gaps where people can get through - the Khyber Pass through Afghanistan, a short stretch of pretty inhospitable coastline in southern Baluchistan, and the jungles of Assam in the east. Either there are tall mountains blocking the way, or these is dense tropical jungle (which until recently was also home to headhunting tribes).\n\nThis seals off the subcontinent from the rest of Asia, which means that historically, civilization in the subcontinent developed and went its own way without a lot of contact from the outside world. This is reflected in languages, culture, cuisine, shared history, etc. The subcontinent has kind of always been its own world.\n\nOf course, these features are due to plate tectonics and continental drift, but you don't **need** a theory of plate tectonics to call it the subcontinent. The actual physical features produced by continental drift, in the form of those big mountains and the resultant impediment to human migrations, have been around for tens of millions of years. We look at the *fact* of the isolation to call it the subcontinent, we don't need to know the geological *why* of it to make those categorizations."

The reason is that the pupil as well as the cognitive mechanisms in the retina and brain (luminance constancy) truncate the light levels above or below the current threshold. \n\n* Scotopic vision - only rods are sensitive enough, and it's too dark for cones (we're color blind)\n* Mesopic vision - Cones start to pick up light, and rods are near saturation\n* Photopic vision - Cones only. Rods are completely saturated (and [chemically unable](_URL_1_) to readapt for half an hour)\n\nThe range that you can experience at any given time is a sliding window of your overall ability to differentiate light levels. Anything below the current range looks black. Anything above it is white (and sometimes painful to prevent you from looking at sources of infrared). Both will cause your eyes to shift the range.\n\nInteresting point: We almost never use scotpic vision anymore. It's rarely dark enough, even in a movie theatre!\n\n**To your question:**\nWhen you're indoors, you are adapted to it. As long as the screens brightness is close to that of the surrounding room, it's not an issue. If, however, you're on a dim monitor in really bright room, you may have have alittle bit of trouble with small text, but you're fine otherwise.\n\n**Why does looking at a screen for too long hurt?**\nMy guesses are (a) not blinking enough - dry eyes suck (b) focusing your eyes closely for too long - your lense is surrounded by muscles. It's probably a combination of the two.\n",

One person (or small group) draws the outlines, another group fills it in, another group does the shading etc.\n\nFor digital works different animators are responsible for very specific items and then share their work. One person (or small team) will collectively create clothing or hair or skin textures. Another group works on the skeleton that you then put the textures on. Another group then works specifically on the motion and movement. Another group on lighting and shading.\n\nThey're using the same items (assets is what they're typically called). Skeleton team saves a model and all the other ones can download it for their use. Texture team saves clothing or skin or what not and every other team can download it and use it so that the digital assets are the same across everyone's department.\n\nFINALLY there is editing that happens, just like a movie. Just like in live-action there are editors to make sure everything makes sense and that people look the same between shots, there are the editors for animation that ensure that there isn't noticeable deviation between frames.",

                "As well as the style sheets and general drawing skill, another factor in traditional animation is called \"inbetweening\". A good artist will draw key frames that depict important dynamic moments in the action, and other competent artists will draw the other frames which depict the movement between the key frames. This method conserves the workload of the good artists and ensures a consistent look to the finished animation."

It's own by an individual or group of individuals and it is theirs to do with as they will (within the law).\n* Public land is land owned by local governments or is otherwise open to the general public during reasonable hours (government offices, parks, etc).\n* Crown land is generally far out into the country and while technically being public land, is the term used to describe public land that is not actively used/domesticated. This would be forests, massive parks, etc.\n\nAssuming you own the land, it needs to be residential. For instance, you can't buy a downtown store and make it into a house. But that's off topic. Almost all land in the country is residential, except for the occasional cement plant or factory which is industrial.\n\nAssuming the land is residential, you need to check to see if the land is part of a greenbelt.\n\nGreenbelts are areas where the government has decided the land is going to be dedicated to agriculture and the building of structures is restricted.\n\nIf you are outside of a Greenbelt, you submit your plans for building a house/large structure and they get approved/disapproved based on the regulations of your area.\n\nIf you are inside a Greenbelt (such as myself) then you have to figure out what you can build. For instance, in my area you can't build any new structures. You can rebuild existing ones, but you can't build brand new houses/barns and you can't sever land. Meaning that you have to buy the whole parcel, you can't just buy 10 acres off the end of a 58 acre farm (unless with government permission which is rare and hard to get).\n\nAssuming that you buy the land, you have to know what structures are allowed. For instance, my family's farm has a house and two barns. Meaning that we can tear those down and replace them but we can only have a single house, and at maximum two barns. Those specifications don't mean much because you can make a structure that is technically a barn, but has bedrooms, running hot and cold water, a kitchen, etc.\n\nSo, in short. If it's generic private residential land, you can buy/sell/sever as you please and submit plans for whatever structures you please.\n\nIf it's private, residential greenbelt land, you can buy/sell as you please and can only submit plans that allow for building structures allowed on your property."

                "Yes, though they take rather longer to wake up than you would on a Monday morning. In fact, most animals that hibernate do have wakeful periods during the hibernation.  They can then go back to sleep without problems.",
                "Hibernation isn't really sleeping for months straight as you might have learned as a kid.  A comparison would be a human who normally sleeps say 8 hours a day instead sleeping 18 hours a day in order to conserve energy.",
                "In some bat species it can be harmful to wake them and could decrease chances of survival in the spring. An unnecessary arousal can deplete energy stores. There isn't really anything for bats to feed on in the winter so fat is limited. \nThere is better sources out there but this is concise. (_URL_0_) ",
                "The answer partly depends on how you define hibernation (i.e. do you lump in diapause, aestivation, serial torpor, brumation).  Some animals, like a black bear, can \"wake up\" fairly quickly (2-10 minutes) and go back to hibernating later, while for others, like many bat species, waking up can be slower and more detrimental, though becoming active is energetically costly for the bear, too.  Some smaller mammals need to rouse themselves regularly from hibernation and engage in multiple torpor sessions dotted with periods of activity when they perform some function, like warming up, feeding, or excreting waste. On the other hand, many animals need particular conditions (e.g. temperature and/or photoperiod) in order to be roused and come back to a temperature and metabolic rate that allows them to function, and may die if you reverse the conditions.\n  \nIn short, large variation exists.  For some animals, it would be a major disruption or even fatal.  For some it would be more of a minor, but significant annoyance.  For others, it may just be a bit earlier than they would have woken anyway.  For many species for which it is survivable, the size of the effect of waking an individual of that species will be a function of its body condition.  \n\nIf you are interested in a good and readable book relevant to this question and written by a reputable professor, check out Bernd Heinrich's Winter World.  In it Heinrich touches on the winter adaptations of many animals, including species demonstrating several hibernation-related strategies."

                "Accounting and bookkeeping are some of the oldest professions, with evidence for their existence dating back over 7,000 years, to the neolithic (stone age) period. In fact, the advent of accounting is largely responsible for the advent of written numbers and language. Back then the largest business organizations were effectively governments, but the fundamentals worked out the same way: whether it's an empire or a corporation all that really matters is that the wealth keeps flowing. And to achieve that you don't need the massive data crunching and networking abilities of modern computers, a modular structure works just fine.\n\nEvery transaction involves a human, so there's the capability to keep track of the transactions if you have the staff to do so. From there it's mostly a matter of summary data being transmitted elsewhere, and then summaries of summaries. A 4th century BCE empire would still have access to a great deal of data regarding the business of the empire but primarily it only needs the summary data. How much grain was grown in an entire province, for example, rather than who grew it and where and so forth. Data that may exist in records some where or merely in some clerk's head, but for the most part data that isn't hugely relevant and not worthy of the cost of trying to keep track of it at every level.\n\nMuch of the historical record in the form of written language from the most ancient civilizations is actually just accounting data. Interestingly, a lot of the historical, versus archaeological, evidence we have about the bronze age collapse is in the form of requests for grain between different parts of empires and other forms of administrative correspondence.\n\nUntil the present day it was necessary for any organization needing to perform accounting for its activities needed to employ a great number of people to do so, depending on scale. The Romans, for example, employed an enormous number of scribes, clerks, and tax collectors. And the British as well as Dutch East India Companies employed thousands of clerks. Throughout history millions upon millions of people have served as record keepers, accountants, clerks, etc. For a very long time the term \"computer\" referred not to a machine but to an individual who performed computations by hand, and there were a great many of them employed prior to the advent of electronic computers.\n\nAs a recent example, consider IBM. They did not spring to life in the computer era, they began decades prior, as the \"Tabulating Machine Company\" dating back to the 1880s. Their earliest lucrative business was in providing automated tabulating machinery using punched cards to the US Census bureau to aid in the censuses of 1890 and 1900. By the 1940s the company had grown to have revenues above $100 million (nearly $2 billion adjusted for inflation for their 1945 revenue), so you can imagine how widespread use of their equipment was. So you can imagine the total revenue of all the companies that used their equipment. And if you think about the fact that for the most part such equipment was used to replace clerks, that gives you some idea of the scale of the total number of clerks employed at the time."

Let's say you're an infant and your parents illegally bring you to the U.S. The Supreme Court case Plyer v. Doe guarantees you a free k-12 education, no questions asked. You were brought here through no fault of your own, you were innocent. You grow up alongside your American peers. You identify with American culture and are way more American than you are, say, Mexican. \nLets say you defy the incredible odds against you and survive the broken American education system and are top of your class.You have been socialized your whole life by your family, teachers, the media, etc. that doing well in school is the ultimate good. Unfortunately for you, your education is only guaranteed through 12th grade so you may be the valedictorian but you can't get into college. Maybe you do get in to college but are forced to pay outside tuition fees (sometimes up to triple the in-state cost) because people claim you are not a citizen. On top of that you do not qualify for any financial aid. ON TOP OF THAT, you can graduate as the top of your class in college and be the most educated person in the world but you still can't get employed legally because you are not a citizen. At any moment throughout that you can be deported because you are not a citizen. \nThese are not hypotheticals either. These are things that have happened to countless people at various stages. Now I ask you, in this situation, is it right for you to be deported? The government invested in your education for 13 years, is it not more beneficial to the country for you to be allowed to stay and pay back that investment by becoming an adjusted member of society and contributing to the economy? You may be one of the brightest young minds in the U.S. but the U.S. does not want to call you theirs, is that fair? It wasn't your fault you were brought here illegally all those years ago. Is it not better for all parties involved for you to instead be granted citizenship? ",

These children were not responsible for their decision to come to the US and have very few connections to their home country. Some don't even speak their parents' language and would have no resources if they were deported. It's only one aspect of the immigrant issue but is one that has received a lot of sympathy from supporters in both political parties.",

We cannot take all people from all over the world, there has to be a limit.  The limit is easily high enough already.\n\nTake Mexico for example.  They have some of the harshest laws against illegal immigration which is usually targeted at the Guatemalans that illegally enter Mexico to work.  The Mexican government understands that it is bad for a country to allow an unlimited number of very poor people to sneak into its country.  But, if you say that in the U.S., people will call you racist.\n\nRead some of Ceasar Chavez's writings.  He was very against illegal immigration because he said it drives down wages for the poor that are legally here.  His message has been corrupted by today's crusaders. ",
                "The short answer is they think US law doesn't let in enough legal immigrants and that these people should have been allowed in anyway. \n\nAs to whether or not they are right, well that's a separate issue.  \n\nFor the same reason people think you shouldn't be throwing people in jail for pot smoking: they think that the law is wrong.

Grenades were used in 17th century battles, but you rarely see any mention of them in descriptions of battles.\n\nHowever, there are some accounts describing the use of personal incendiary weapons. Jean de Joinville, *The Life of St Louis* has\n\n >  Finally, they brought up a peasant, who threw Greek fire at them thrice. Once William of Boon caught the vessel of Greek fire on his buckler, for if it had set light to anything on him, he would have been burnt. We were all covered with the fire-darts that missed the serjeants.\n\nThere is a short world-wide summary of ancient and early Medieval incendiary weapons in the early part of *Science and Civilisation in China, Vol. 5, Part 7 Military Technology: The Gunpowder Epic* (about 30 pages).\n\n >  throwing a pot filled with a flammable liquid at a shield wall would most definitelly be enough to break formation.\n\nYou can find modern video footage of rioters throwing Molotov cocktails at shield walls.

                "Maybe this is a bit of a cop-out, but I would postulate the people who would most enjoy hip hop historically would be Medieval West African peoples, as the originating cultures who, with some slave-syncretism to White-European cultural archetypes, created many of the important aspects of hip hop culture (the general hip-oriented competitive dancing techniques commonly employed, the [call-and-response group oriented singing](_URL_0_), etc).\n\nHowever, I feel all historical peoples would be completely shocked by modern music, outside perhaps folk and modern art music (what you might call \"modern classical\"). There's been such a departure from traditional music, something like Skrillex would be utterly alien to them.",
                "Hip-hop and rock wouldn't translate well at all.  Almost none of it would really be \"danceable\" if you went back farther than the 1950s (and even that's a stretch for some things).  Keep in mind that the principal instruments in popular music today are fairly new.  Electric guitars were invented in 1952 by Les Paul, and though the first thing that could be considered a modern Synth existed in 1939, the first synthesizer that was actually on the market to be bought/used/played was the Moog in 1965.  \n\nSo not only would you be expecting someone to adapt to a completely different type of rhythm alien to their culture, but you'd be expecting them comprehend instruments they hadn't ever heard before.  Its a tough thing for people to adjust to.  I think your best bet would be with pre-European African cultures, as was posted earlier.  \n\nYou might have better luck with something harmonically universal and simpler rhythmically like the blues, but even that, only if you were playing it for composers/performers.  Laymen would hear it as very dissonant because of the dominant I chord.  (In non-jargon, there's an extra note in the chord any blues is based in that wasn't culturally accepted for the most part before jazz.  People would interpret it as a wrong note).\n\nIn a similar vein, I'm not an art historian, but I'm sure artist from the renaissance would be completely shocked by someone like Mondrian.  Culture doesn't translate back well.  \n\nTL;DR Its easier for us to enjoy where we came from then for where we came from to enjoy/understand where we went.\n\nEdit: double checked a fact, was off by a few years.  ",
                "This might not be an answer you were expecting, but I'm pretty sure American Bluegrass music would be pretty popular in pre-modern Europe. It's kind of comparable to older European folk music like Hungarian Csardas as well as Irish ceili music it's influenced by.",
                "I think that in terms of Western Music History, the only thing that I could imagine bringing back to another decade is modern pop music.  I would bring that back to the classical era (1750-1800).  Many people would not understand it, but they would generally recognize the chord structures, and they would probably enjoy its dance-ability.  Modern pop music basically tricks our brain into releasing endorphin, because we have certain expectations about where the music will go, and when the music fulfills our predictions, the brain releases endorphin.  The chords and structures in pop music today (mostly I-IV-V-I and full cadences) would be mostly familiar to Classical era listeners.  Later composers tried to do more technically complicated things, and may not appreciate the simple nature as much.  It would certainly take whoever is listening some time to get used to the new instruments and computer generated sounds, but at least they would recognize it as music, and could come to enjoy it.  "

                "Long story short: No because the Olympic Games in classical Greece was the most famous Panhellenic game and as such was thought of as the most glorifying. In the revival, a Greek poet called Soutsos urged for the glorification of mid-19th century Greece through a revival of the Olympic Games and that specific Panhellenic game stuck with future revivalists. \n\n\n\nI am summarizing this quite a bit from a book called \"A brief History of the Olympic Games\" by David C. Young but the revival of the games started by a Greek poet Panagiotis Soutsos who wrote a poem called \"Dialogue of the Dead\" in 1833 in which during a conversation with Plato's ghost, the ghost asks \"Where are your Olympic games?\" as a way to question why 19th century Greece is in shambles compared to the glory of classical greece. Young points out why Soutsos used the Olympic games and not one of the other Panhellenic games for the revival of Greek glory: \"In antiquity the Olympic Games symbolized excellence and prestige, a focal point for all of Greek culture\" (Young 141). This is important because if Soutsos has called for a different Panhellenic Game then we might have a different name for our modern Olympic Game.\n\n\n\nWhat we, as historians, classify as modern Olympic Games did not start until a Frenchmen named Pierre de Coubertin came along. Even then, the Olympic revival did not become a smashing success until the 1908 London Games as the 1896,1900, and 1904 games were largely problematic due to location or political agendas. \n\n\n\nThe closest we get to a Panhellenic Game by Coubertin is the 1906 Intercalated games which were supposed to be the Olympic Games held only in Athens, Greece every two years between the Olympic Games (which were held internationally). You can read about these games in journal by Karl Lennartz called \"The 2nd International Olympic Games in Athens 1906\". This game, although sharing the same 2-year post olympic setting as the Panhellenic \"Pythian Games\" had, was created with no thought of the Pythian Games in mind (hence the different name) and as such is not considered a revival of a different Panhellenic game.\n\n\n\nThe Olympic Game revival began as a platform to get schoolchildren into athletics at school because there were a lot of philosophers in the late 19th century suggesting the training of both the mind and the body and through various social-Darwinistic viewpoints, that the English population was not ready for war because they allow the weak to breed. So the Olympic Games were a way to ensure school children would be fit so they could get glory in the Olympic games. This is evident in the W.P. Brookes' revival of the Olympic games in Wenlock, England. They were eventually called the Wenlock Games and were fundamental to Coubertin's influence in a modern revival. For more on this read \"Olympism\" by Pierre de Coubertin and edited by Norbert Muller.\n\n\n\nSources: \n\n\"Dialogue of the Dead\" by Panagiotis Soutsos\n\n\"A Brief History of the Olympic Games\" by David C. Young\n\n\"The 2nd International Olympic Games in Athens 1906\" by Karl Lennartz\n\n\"Olympism\" by Pierre de Coubertin and edited by Norbert Muller\n\n"

                "Let me try to give an objective answer to /r/SRS:\n\nThe supporters of /r/SRS believe that the world has no place for \"hate speech\".  This includes misogyny, racism, etc.  They link to these comments for two reasons: a) so that they can be discussed inside SRS and, b) so that they can be quickly downvoted.  Many supporters of SRS would claim that they don't wish to BAN such speech as that they wish to affect change on reddit such that these types of comments are downvoted more often than they are upvoted (and that hopefully this trend would catch on outside of the SRS \"vanguard\").  This is similar to the idea of \"I'm not going to pass a law that says you can't say this, but I'm not going to stand by and do nothing, either\".  Also, although I'm not a member of SRS (nor do I agree with them most of the time), I think they would say that most of the comments with which they have issues are \"ha ha only serious\" and more truly reflect the commenter's true beliefs than the commenter or the rest of reddit would like to believe.\n\nThe opponents of SRS might say that the subreddit started with fairly decent intentions, but has become a \"clique\" of \"true believers\" and that their actions today more closely approximate a \"witch hunt\" than an honest attempt at changing the overall discourse of reddit.  Opponents also claim that SRS is not even-handed in its criticism and, for example, tends to oppose anti-woman speech much more than anti-man speech.  Also, opponents might say that the \"downvote brigade\" approach is dangerously close to actual censorship and, thus, counter to one of reddit's core values.  Anti-SRS advocates tend to reject the \"ha ha only serious\" theory of SRS and contend that offensive statements and jokes are either really just jokes for the sake of being shocking or funny, or that they are \"court jester satire\" and valuable in a world where political correctness often silences debate on certain issues.  Lastly, they would accuse SRS of being too ideological and banning those who disagree with them, etc.\n\nIn the end, the battle between SRS and its supporters and the rest of reddit reflects a larger cultural battle between those who feel hate speech is a real and present danger and must be actively battled, and those who feel that doing so simply creates taboos and underground ideologies, thus paradoxically making these unpleasant views more popular than they would have been to begin with.\n\nI'm simplifying of course, but hopefully you get the idea.\n\nEDIT: Also, there is controversy over weather SRS is or is not satire, a \"circlejack\" (as the SRS FAQ says), or a \"downvote brigade\" (as the SRS FAQ claims it is not).  My thought on this is that it's semi-satire."

They were awful quiet after this which suprised analysts and news media.\n\nEdit: BY the way, the afghans didn't identify the target as a hospital when they called for us to hit it. Were they taking fire and did they know it was a hospital when they called it in? No one seems to know.",
                "I wrote about it [here](_URL_0_) but to sum it up:\n\n* Kunduz - a city of 300,000 - was recently taken by the Taliban and the Afghan National Army has been fighting to retake it. The US is providing air support to tip the balance in favor of the Afghans and so US ground troops do not need to be sent in.\n* The building itself isn't identified like a hospital here is with a big red cross and a bunch of other signs stating that it is a hospital. To add to the complexity, it would require visual identification from the air because of the way the aircraft in question is used.\n* The Pentagon has stated that the aircraft in question is the AC-130 Gunship.\n* MSF/DWB claims that the bombing was \"precise strikes\" that lasted for over 30 minutes. MSF/DWB also claims that it was bombs, but that isn't possible: precise bombing would have absolutely flattened the hospital with just one or two bombs, much less continuous bombardment for 30+ minutes.\n* This makes the AC-130 even more likely, as the AC-130 is a gunship. It does not use bombs or missiles - it uses a combination of 20mm miniguns, a 40mm Bofors autocannon, or a 105mm cannon/howitzer.\n\nIn addition, the AC-130 finds targets by using cameras/infrared scopes to *visually* identify targets. Thus, this isn't a matter of coordinates or dropping a bomb accidentally - this action would have involved them visually seeing targets to attack. In addition, this makes all the reports of MSF/DWB giving GPS coordinates irrelevant: the gunship doesn't find targets using a map or GPS coordinates, it finds them visually by finding hostiles and targeting them.\n\nWhat's most likely to have happened, at least from the often contradictory details, is that the AC-130 gunship was providing air support and the Afghans gave coordinates/the building as a source of enemy fire, and the gunship went in to support the troops fighting nearby and fired on the target.\n\nNote that MSF/DWB doesn't state that there weren't possible Taliban fighters operating nearby/being treated at the hospital, as they treat everyone, which further complicates the scenario as it is entirely possible that fighters were entering/exiting the area/compound itself."

                "That's not forging, what you're describing is \"casting\".  \nForging involves 'hammering' an object into shape. Casting involves 'pouring' a liquid into a mold.  \nThe classic way to 'cast' stone is via \"sintering\" which is a process where you take a powder and heat it until the particles all stick to each other (think firing clay). Fill your mold with powder and something to hold it together and heat it in some sort of kiln.  \nYou can do what you describe, it's pretty common in the ceramic arts. Glass casting goes back at least to the Roman times. The process for a 'stone' wouldn't be too different (I've poured lab-made 'lava' on several occasions).   \nThere are also guys out there who literally go out and scoop lava (actual lava from a volcano) into molds. ",
                "Forging, as others mentioned, is the process of heating and hammering a piece of metal until it is of shape. Forging doesn't work well with stone, as the materials we think of as stone are almost always very brittle. \n\nSolid materials come in one of two very broad categories: stretchy and brittle. Usually, stretchy things are weaker, because of the very nature of being stretchy; you're pulling material apart. Brittle things are usually stronger, because their atoms make a very stable structure. These are broad generalizations, of course.\n\nMetal, at certain temps, gets very stretchy, but doesn't become liquid. The bonds between atoms start to weaken due to all of the energy everywhere, but the metal hasn't hit melting point yet. This allows us to hammer it into a certain shape, which also kind of kneads the stretchy bonds into a shape that is very stable when it cools down (tempering) \n\nStone materials never really hit the same stretchy-but-not-goopy stage metals do. They go from pretty solid to pretty liquid in a very short temperature range. When they're solid, they are brittle; their bonds are very stable and arranged just so. If you hit a brittle material, it will not stretch; it will crack, like glass does, because it's bonds cannot stretch. There are all sorts of deep-down atomic reasons for why some bonds will stretch and some will not, but for the most part, stone is in the latter category."

                "Zeng Guofan was a scholar by training, but when the Taiping Civil War broke out, he joined his fellow scholar-landowners in raising militias to fight the rebels after the dynasty's actual military failed.  Eventually, Zeng's militia absorbed its neighbors, becoming the Xiang Army, and he took it upon himself to reconquer the state the rebels had carved out in the Yangtze river valley.  \n\nZeng, like the other scholars of Imperial China, was a Neo-Confucian, and one of the tenants of the philosophy is strict self discipline.  Zeng would always spend an hour in contemplation in the morning, walked a thousand paces after every meal, never starting a book until he finished the one he was then reading, keeping a diary every day, and so on.  Furthermore, there were several arts the Chinese gentleman was expected to master in the process of self-cultivation, and one of them is the game weiqi, commonly known in the west by its Japanese name, Go.  Every day, Zeng played a game of Go with his subordinates, and if you squint, his strategy reflected the closest thing he had to prior military experience.  Points in Go are assigned for holding territory on the board, and enemy stones are removed by encirclement, not by direct attack as in chess.\n\nSince Zeng had no experience leading armies in the field prior to the war, it's unsurprising that he was a poor battle commander, suffering disastrous defeats at Jiujiang and Three Rivers, the latter leading to a suicide attempt on his part.  He did, however, possess a keen strategic mind.  The fighting in the Taiping Civil War took place mostly along the wealthy and fertile Yangtze river, so many cities were heavily fortified.  The progress of the war largely came down a series of sieges; Chinese walls were too thick to breach with the cannons available, so it was necessary to surround enemy strongholds, whereupon they could be forced to surrender.  Zeng Guofan himself was threatened with encirclement by Chen Yucheng as he besieged Anqing, but his cavalry commander, the Manchu Duolonga, managed to outflank the Brave King; it was encirclement within encirclement within encirclement, the same way you win in Go."

For example pregnant females have progesterone and prolactin increases that result in expanded mammalary glands that result in bigger boobs. If we take a step back we then evaluate how different proteins and cellular functions lead to these hormones being generated and regulated and what controls these proteins? It is due to genetics and gene expression. TL;DR-hormones alter development, genes control those hormones. ",

Different cultures and populations over the last 100 thousands of years had different preferences and the constant mixing of these genes causes the great variety of breast size and shape that we see today. So the simple answer is genetics, and the why is sexual selection. This goes both ways too. Flaccid penis size and facial hair were sexually selected for as well. These features were selected for by our female ancestors. The interplay of these various genetic factors creates the variety that we see today.",

                "Time for my evolutionary biology degree to shine! \n\nLike some posters already mentioned, they vary by body weight, genetics, etc., but that doesn't get to the root cause. Why are they so variable in the first place? Ears, for example, are almost identical sizes across a population, and they don't really have a very serious function or bones to hold them together. \n\nThey key factor that has been missing from this discussion is **symmetry**! Breasts are under sexual selection, that is, natural selection not by what makes you \"fittest\" but by what makes you more \"sexy\" to others in your species. Large breasts are preferred, but asymmetric breasts are strongly disliked. The balance between these is what makes breasts so \"unstable\" as a trait in humans.\n\n[Here is an incredibly relevant paper, from 1997.](_URL_0_) I'll break down the abstract for you below. \n\n > Breasts in humans are highly sexually dimorphic compared to other closely related primate species. \n\nThat means, human males and human females have markedly more different breast sizes than similar species \n\n\n >  One possible explanation for this increase in breast size is that breast asymmetry contains information regarding women's phenotypic quality. \n\nThis presents the hypothesis: that breast asymmetry is a signal for the overall \"quality\" of the woman.\n\n >  The purpose of this work was to consider the relationship between asymmetry and measures of body size, body composition, and fertility. We found significant associations between breast asymmetry and height, body mass, and breast volume (positive associations), breast “density” (negative association), and the woman's age and her age at first childbirth (positive associations). \n\nWhat they actually found: asymmetric breasts are more common in tall, heavy women, in larger but less dense breasts, and more common in older women.\n\n >  The relationship between asymmetry and breast volume showed evidence of negative allometry, that is, women with large breasts had smaller asymmetry than expected for their breast size. Asymmetry was lower in married women compared to unmarried women and negatively related to offspring number. A multiple regression analysis, with breast asymmetry as the dependent variable, showed a strong significant relationship with breast volume (positive association) and significant relationships with age at first childbirth (positive association) and number of offspring (negative association). Asymmetric women therefore had fewer children later in life that did symmetric women. Simple linear and multiple regression analysis showed that breast volume was a strong predictor of body size and composition (weight, height, and breast density) and a weak predictor of age and age at menarche. It was not related to offspring number or age at first childbirth. \n\nThis is some added proof to back up their theory, saying that small breasts are even more symmetrical than you'd expect, and that married women with lots of children had symmetrical breasts. \n\n >  Our data support the thesis that mammotropic hormones, particularly estrogen, are harmful because they suppress the immune system. Heavy women with high levels of body fat produce more estrogen and, therefore, bigger breasts. However, more estrogen leads to an increase in breast asymmetry. Women with “good genes” are able to produce symmetric breasts despite the presence of large quantities of estrogen. Large and symmetric breasts are therefore honest signals of high phenotypic quality in women.\n\nAnd finally their conclusion: big breasts are good, but the way to make them is to have more estrogen, and that also means more asymmetry. Because estrogen weakens the immune system, it's bad for the overall \"quality\" of the woman. So only women with very good genes and very good health can have breasts that are both large and symmetrical. Because it's easy for parts of this to go wrong, you get lots of variability. ",
                "I think this is less of a question about physical influences (e.g., diet, exercise, etc.), but rather a question about evolutionary theory. Why do breast sizes vary in the first place?\n\n >  \"The cause of the original variability of secondary sexual characters is not manifest; but we can see why these characters should not have been rendered constant and uniform as other parts of the organization; for secondary sexual characters have been accumulated by sexual selection, which is less rigid in its action than ordinary selection, as it does not entail death, but only gives fewer offspring to the less favored [fe]males.\" - Charles Darwin, *On the Origin of Species*",
                "There are two things that increase the variation, that is the spread around a mean (average) value: Selective sweep and genetic drift. \n\nSelective sweep is when a trait is strongly selected for or against. The boobies have been under tremendous sexual selection in human populations, since they signal sexual maturity and also the capacity of producing milk (even if the latter is wrong, our ancestors might not have noticed it and hence, they might have been the victim of a spurious correlation). \n\nThe other reason, genetic drift, occurs especially when the population is big, then small, then big again (aka \"bottleneck\"). Drift is simply the change in genetic variation among a population due to random effects. We know that humans were impacted by genetic drift since in fact, human population size went down to about 10-30 thousand individuals about 60-70 thousand years ago (even though this bottleneck is controversial among evolutionary biologists, there are signs of a bottleneck which may had been just a longer bottleneck than usual, with even fewer individuals). \n\nSo, when these two are combined, it is actually mathematically imperative that variation has to increase. And that, my friend, is why we have lots of different boobies and gosh, dare to tell me that you don't love evolution! :P",
                "A better way to think of this question is, \"Why would natural selection have resulted in boobs of such variety.\"",
                "They store fat, like other body parts that can be 4x bigger between individuals. Butts, stomachs, and thighs all come in as much size variation as boobs do. ",
                "Most of the make-up of, and variation in boobs is fat. Amount and location of fat on people's bodies is affected by lots of things, including exercise. Some women's boobs, butts, hips change a lot during their lives- mostly because changes in amounts of fat. ",

                "[This](_URL_0_?) [**NSFW**] recent post is what inspired my question. I've seen many breasts in my lifetime but something about the shape and mass of this one sparked the question. I did think about the fat theory but as we've all seen, online at the very least, that some girls are skinny with large breasts, and bellies and butts in these thin women are never 2x-4x larger in size compared to other skinny women with small breasts. And many mention dicks but generally speaking they don't vary in size to such a degree. Even in the inspired picture, her breasts are closer to 6x larger then some, [Keira Knightley](_URL_1_) [**NSFW**] is a wonderful example. \n\nThere were a lot of explanations as to the how, but the root of the question is to the why. Why are breasts, in particular, a evolutionary free for all. Well.... With that being said, I say, set them free.\n\nExcellent responses ladies and gentlemen. I think every man should know this so when a woman removes her push up bra, he'll understand better as to where the tits went, and every woman should know this so they understand better as to why their BFF Stacy has bigger ones then hers and to help minimize confusion.",
                "I'd say noses can vary as much in size as breasts.. you can have tiny flat ones, or huge beaky ones. I'd guess the reason that all sizes in between still exist, is down to the fact that enough people are attracted to noses of such a wide range of sizes, that no one particular size has 'won out' in evolutionary terms. Same with breasts. If all men liked large breasts, then all breasts would be large. If all people liked small noses, then all noses would be small. \n\nAdmittedly, I am no biologist. But I have done considerable field work on the subject of breasts.",
                "Let's talk *sexual selection,* the more fun and less gruesome (but equally merciless) sister of *natural selection*.\n\nTo go straight to the most famous and clear example, breasts have the same challenge as the peacock's tail: bigger is often better (although it's also a matter of proportion etc and in the modern human world cultural preference and experience might be relevant too), but on the one hand it has side effects and on the other only genetically good individuals can successfully pull it off. It takes the right balance to get there and of course you also need to survive once you have it.\n\nTo go to the peacock: in general (and a tad simplified), the bigger the tail the more likely female peacock's will mate with a male. But symmetry is also important and the male also has to be in good health - and bad health shows first and foremost in weak colours and damage of the tail. So the male with a smaller but symmetric tail and good health is more likely to reproduce than the one with a bigger but less symmetric tail and/or worse health. Either one has a chance, but *on average and/or over many generations* this effect is measurable. There is also a natural limit (which might be somewhat changed by eg modern medicine) where a peacock's large tail/a woman's large breast might not just be difficult for the body to 'do well' but will also negatively affect health and survival - eg women with big breasts have plenty of back problems (and in a world without clothes might more quickly show their age weigh sagging breasts...) and peacocks with big tails will have trouble escaping predators and keeping themselves healthy and alive. So only genetically good individuals (or in modern humans this might also be those with access to resources, eg through well-off parents that had good food  &  medical access - this is an alternative or *additional* marker of mate quality) will be able to sustain such a feature in a good quality until mate choice/reproduction.\n\nIn evolutionary theory those are considered 'honest signals'. - they are desirable features but not every individual can show them to the same degree. This they form an important element in sexual selection - the more 'choosy' a species is the more important are such signals. Another example are large antlers in deer and moose or complicated songs and unusually long and colourful feathers in some bird species.\n\nLast note: in humans the female hip-to-waist ratio seems to be a more important and stable marker for genetic quality (or rather: fertility). There is not just some modern scientific evidence for the correlation (it's not a direct link - the right hip to weight ratio does not improve fertility, rather both are affected by the underlying health from gestation onwards), but even across art of all centuries the same ratios are popular - even when tastes for overall bodyweight, including the usually somewhat weight-proportional breast size, changed over time.",
                "I will attempt to summarize the answers in a way that a 5 year old might understand, as I see a lot of abstracts from studies and we can simplify, right? \n\nThey CAN grow as much as they do because it's mostly fat. Just like butt cheeks and bellies. Hands and feet, on the other hand, are limited by bones. \n\nThey DO VARY because of natural selection. If in some region, women with large breasts were considered more attractive, they were more prone to have more children, transferring that trait more. Additionally, hormones control their size and hormones can go crazy due to food, puberty, pregnancy and more. "

                "Yes, this sort of thing did happen very often, at least in my limited experience of reading slave narratives. Slave traders and owners were incredibly strict about cracking down on practically *any* expression by their slaves of any culture other than the culture of slavery, largely because they were extremely paranoid about rebellion. (You can't enslave millions of people and expect them not to rebel unless you take some pretty drastic measures.) The enforcement of slave culture included mixing together newly imported slaves from different places in Africa, creating linguistic barriers and forcing slaves to learn English. Any expressions of African art or religion were severely punished, or even modes of Christian expression that fell outside the norm established by the masters (with its emphasis on Biblical passages about slaves dutifully obeying their masters, in contrast to the slaves' preferred passages about Moses leading his people out of Egypt). Allowing a slave to retain an African name gave him or her a definitive link back to home, family, and country; *all* such links had to be severed in order for the slave to become fully psychologically integrated into slave culture.\n\nIt certainly happened to Olaudah Equiano on the boat from Africa to England, as he recounts in his *[Interesting Narrative](_URL_0_)*:  \n\n > While I was on board this ship, my captain and master named me Gustavus Vasa. I at that time began to understand him a little, and refused to be called so, and told him as well as I could that I would be called Jacob; but he said I should not, and still called me Gustavus; and **when I refused to answer to my new name, which at first I did, it gained me many a cuff**; so at length I submitted, and was obliged to bear the present name, by which I have been known ever since.  \n\nThis case is a little odd because Equiano acquired both the names Jacob and Michael after having passed into the hands of English-speaking slaveowners, but for unclear reasons he didn't seem to mind those two as much as Gustavus Vassa; maybe he was tired of having his name arbitrarily changed all the time. He later went back to the Igbo name by which he wrote his autobiography.  \n\nSolomon Northup, in his *[Twelve Years a Slave](_URL_1_)*, mentions being given the name Platt:  \n\n > \"Captain, where's Platt?\" demanded Theophilus Freeman.  \nThe captain was unable to inform him, no one being, on board answering to that name.  \n\"Who shipped that nigger?\" he again inquired of the captain, pointing to me.  \n\"Burch,\" replied the captain.  \n\"Your name is Platt—you answer my description. Why don't you come forward?\" he demanded of me, in an angry tone.  \nI informed him that was not my name; that I had never been called by it, but that I had no objection to it as I knew of.  \n\"Well, I will learn you your name,\" said he; \"and so you won't forget it either, by ----,\" he added.  \n\nAny actual violence done to Northup in the interest of \"learning\" him his name is not recorded, but he does end up acceding to the name Platt. Northup's case is particularly interesting because he was a free Northerner who had been abducted from his wife and children and sold into slavery under the pretense that he was actually an escaped slave from Georgia named Platt. Forcing him to submit to his new name was therefore obviously a necessity for the slave traders."

                "\"Remember, all men would be tyrants if they could,\" wrote Abigail Adams in 1776. Thirty-five years later, she might well have added \"and they're not shy about trying.\" Scholars today generally agree that the (recognized then as) unconstitutional theft of voting rights in 1807 was essentially a strategy in white male-led political parties' jockeying for power over the state. However, the specific assumptions and ideologies that made the strategy attractive and effective depended on racism, sexism, nationalism, classism, and good old-fashioned fear.\n\nJan Lewis suggests that the voting rights of New Jersey's black women, white women, black men, and foreign-born residents were initially recognized simply out of revolutionary Americans' commitment to the underly egalitarianism of republican ideals. Irwin Gertzog is more pragmatic, arguing that the added specificity of \"he or she\", first restricted to half the state (1790) and eventually extended to the whole (1797), was already a calculated power ploy. \n\nEither way, by 1798 it's clear that the major political parties in the state, the Federalists and the Republicans, recognized especially the voting power of women. Despite the implicit and explicit restrictions on which women could vote--enslaved black women could not; free black and white women who were married could not (because under the law of coverture, they could not own property independently)--contemporary observers were daunted by the scale of potential women voters. A 1791 newspaper article was titled \"The Humble Address of Ten Thousand Federal Maids\"; in 1799, William Griffith similarly estimated, \"of widows and spinsters above\ntwenty one, there can not, I imagine be fewer than 10,000.\" In a state where elections could be decided by hundreds or even tens of votes, 10,000 was a daunting number.\n\nFurthermore, an idea was developing that we might consider a precursor to identity politics: the belief that groups like \"women\" and \"black men\" were homogenous blocs of voting interest. (But of course white men can have their own opinions.) On one hand, this meant that each party worked *furiously* to court The Woman Voter in hotly contested elections like the Essex County legislator race of 1797 (in which this all-powerful voting bloc amounted *seventy-five* women; I have not seen statistics on their race). On the other, it meant that both parties deeply feared the potential for women, black men, and immigrants to vote for the bad guys. \n\nAnd naturally, *both* parties developed a conviction that women, especially, would turn out for the other. Naturally, too, these parallel developments were both motivated by classism. Federalists worried that it was easier to get women to vote in (Republican-stronghold) towns than in (Federalist-stronghold) cities; Republicans worried that the women more likely to vote were the wealthier, conservative Federalists. They also seem to have simply assumed that black men and women were Federalists, period.\n\nOr at least, the party leadership--that is, the men actively seeking to acquire and maintain power--did. A ballot initiative to strip the vote from everyone with at least 50 pounds of property and implement a white male taxpayer-based system failed *miserably* with the general population. There was a definite rift developing between the regular electorate and the power-holders, who had nervously watched the French Revolution tear down waves of political leaders and feared a similar outcome if more widespread participation in American politics.\n\nThe years between the 1800 election that so focused on winning women voters and 1806-07, when efforts to restrict suffrage kicked back up, witnessed several important developments. First, The Black Voter played the role of the desperately wooed in the 1804 election that The Woman Voter had in 1800, coupled with New Jersey's passage of a gradual emancipation law. \n\nSecond, newspapers were filled with two-sided worry. Women voters were more likely to commit election fraud (generally accusations that enslaved women or free married women were sneaking in a vote); women were neglecting their proper duties to get involved in politics and society was falling apart; the initial constitutional recognition of women's voting wrights was wrong. BUT it was just that: a constitutional right, so they couldn't be deprived of it without a new constitution, and that wasn't happening. \n\nJudith Klinghoffer and Lois Elkis have argued that sexist ideology (they are not really concerned with race, unfortunately) had little to no role to play in these developments; the evidence does not seem to back that up. As with the editorials arguing that the 1776 constitution and 1790/97 amendments were wrong in extending voting rights to women, gender is not silent. But it's not the *driving* or causal factor. Rather, we can see how sexist and racist ideology played into the lust for political power and control, or rather, became the field on which it played out. The assumption that all women and all black people voted the same; the belief that losses were due to election fraud and of course it was women and black people committing the fraud.\n\n(For the record: Gertzhog says it was actually mostly men, and there is evidence for this. A lot of the fraud involved keeping polls open days or weeks too long, or waiting until the ballots for an area dominated by the other party were counted and announced so they'd know how many to...scrounge up in order to win. In other words: tactics conceived and operated by party leadership, i.e. white men).\n\nBut while the initial recognition of voting rights and the first efforts at suppressing them had come from inter-party conflict, it was actually *intra*-party problems that ultimately killed suffrage for property-owning unmarried free black and white women and black men. Once again, the immediate cause was electoral politics and the relentless pursuit of power by white men; the means were racism and sexism.\n\nIn 1804, the Republican party split both geographically and ideologically into a \"moderate\" and \"liberal\" wing (with the Federalists occupying the other \"conservative\" pole). Among other things, the liberals actually wanted *universal* suffrage, not even connected to property ownership! But naturally, this rivalry played out as \"The Room Where It Happens.\" New Jersey needed a new courthouse, and the dominating Republicans were at war with themselves whether to put it in the liberal north or the moderate south.\n\nAnd a presidential election loomed.\n\nThe moderates offered a compromise: we'll let you put the courthouse in (Republican) Newark if you agree to restrict voting to white male citizen taxpayers. And this will restore party unity and *we won't support the Federalist candidate.* So in this case, we know exactly what the moderates said to the liberals to get them to sell black and white women's and black men's suffrage down the river: political power.\n\nThe liberal Republicans' acceptance of this bargain, thus, betrays their own racism and sexism. The desire to stay in power brought into conflict egalitarian republican ideals of equality and contemporary white patriarchy; white patriarchy won *in order for* their political power goals to succeed. Race and sex were not the cause, but were the tools.\n\nFurther Reading:\n\n*  Irwin Gertzog, \"Female Suffrage in New Jersey, 1790-1807,\" *Women  &  Politics* 10 (1990)\n* Judith Klinghoffer and Lois Elkis, \"'The Petticoat Electors': Women's Suffrage in New Jersey, 1776-1807,\" *Journal of the Early Republic* 12 (1992)\n* Robert Dinkin, *Before Equal Suffrage: Women in Partisan Politics from Colonial Times to 1920* (1995)\n* Jan Lewis, \"A Revolution for Whom?

Not western style boots, more of a military / hiking / trail runner style that is pretty comfortable, provides ankle support and foot protection and is conducive to running. \n\nWhen my dad was a patrolman (early 70s) it was black oxfords and they wore a tie as part of their uniform, which was a holdover from earlier times when even bus drivers and the milkman wore a tie.

What most officers here do, myself included, is go for whatever style we want and just pay the difference, which is around 50 to 100 bucks.\n\nThe kind I use is a boot designed like a pair of running shoes. They offer protection like a boot around the food and ankle, but don't have the rigidity of a boot. Some prefer to have thicker/taller boots though.\n\nThe main reason I think there isn't a standard issue black running shoe is due to proneness for injury.

But even this example is a poor example because chloroform will probably try to separate from water based on hydrophobicity alone, not just density, and even on Earth I need a centrifuge to speed it up.

                "Gravity is so weak that it basically has no effect on protons and electrons in chemical reactions. The Coulombic attraction and repulsion of electrons and nuclei far outweigh any gravitational effects. \n\nLet's look at the ratio of the difference between the coulomb force and gravity between a proton and an electron: F_coul / F_grav = (k * q^2 / r^2 ) / (G * m^2 / r^2 ) where k is the coulomb constant, G is the graviational constant, q is electric charge for our proton or electron and r is the distance between the proton and electron. Simplifying our original ratio, we get: F_coul / F_grav = (k * q^2) / (G * m^2 ). Plugging in our constant values we get: F_coul = ~10^42 * F_grav.\n\nThis means that the coulombic force far outweighs the gravitational attraction between a proton and an electron, with the added detail that this is true at ANY distance, since our distance variable r got cancelled out in the above ratio. So to reiterate, the coulombic force is so much stronger than gravity, that it's basically negligible on the molecular scale, and we shouldn't see any difference in chemical reactions performed in space.",
                "The sort of energy scales that are relevant to chemical reactions are generally much larger than the energy scales associated with local gravitational sources. \n\nThat is to say, to a physicist/chemist, this question would be analogous to me asking \"how much harder is it for me to open my bedroom door when it is very dusty?\" (The added weight is negligible), or perhaps \"when I pour a glass of water into the Gulf of Mexico, how much does it increase erosion along the Gulf Coast?\" (The added volume is negligible).\n\nNow, there may be macroscopic effects that chemists care about--if they're precipitating large crystals out of solution, who knows the way they form is uniquely due to gravity or if crystal growth would be more isotropic in zero gravity (I suspect the growth would still cluster around the sides of the container, even if there is no 'preferred' side, like the bottom would be in the presence of gravity).\n\nBut in terms of chemical reaction rates and fundamental properties of chemical interactions, local gravitational sources are irrelevant. \n\nThis is probably not true very near the event horizon of a black hole, but then you have bigger issues to worry about than finishing your experiment.... :)",

                "If there's a certain force that you need to apply to the interface to overcome friction, call it f_f, you'd need a linear pulling force f_p equal to f_f to slide it out, or a torque equal to r_i · f_f, where r_i is the radius of the interface.  If it's a simple cylindrical cork, then the torque you get by gripping the cork and applying a rotational force f_g at radius r_i is torque = r_i · f_g, so the result is simply that you need f_g = f_f to get it to move.  In that case, either f_g or f_p needs to equal f_f to get it to move, and the only advantage of twisting is if your hand strength and anatomy can a apply a larger f_g than f_p.  That may in fact be the case.\n\nBut if the cork is mushroom shaped, or even just tapered, the radius where you grip it, let's call that r_g, can be larger than r_i.  In that case, you get leverage magnifying the force, and f_i = f_g (r_g/r_i).  In other cases where you have some larger part of the object to grip, you can take advantage of this leverage effect.\n\nWhether you get the initial advantage by leverage (applying torque where the radius is larger) or by making best use your of anatomy, once you get it to move, you can take advantage of sliding friction sometimes being lower than static friction and/or the vector addition of forces as noted in other comments to proceed with removal using a lower pulling force than would have been required with simple pulling."

Penal labour definitely happened in France at the time - save for some brief times during later revolutions - though I can't comment on whether they worked with ships or how many it would take to pull a ship into a dock like that.\n",
                "A book you might want to check out is Miranda Spieler's [_Empire and Underworld: Captivity in French Guiana_](_URL_0_).  Though the lion's share of the book is about the French penal system established in the colonies in the late 19th century, Spieler has an entire chapter about the state's treatment of convicts in the earlier part of the century that pertains to your question about prisoners in _Les Mis_.\n\nDuring the Revolution and after, the state began to introduce forms of civil death and deportation - many of which were ceremonial and theoretical, rather than physical - to separate criminals from the rest of society.  This included civic degradation (the ceremonial removal of citizenship, which happened with the émigrés), legal interdiction (the suspension of all civil rights during a prison sentence), civil death (the forfeiture of one’s nationality and loss of all civil rights for life), and systems of surveillance that were meant to control the bodies of everyone outside the legal boundaries of the state.  “Prisons” for everyday crimes often weren’t stationary institutions the way we think of them today (though that would change throughout the 19th century).  Mobile units of convict workers were a common means of keeping tabs on the bodies of convicts, backed by the conception that convicts were civilly and legally dead in the eyes of the state.\n\nThis is one of the reasons Jean Valjean is such a prototypical character for that time period.   Around the time that _Les Mis_ takes place, there were an increasing number of territories within France from which ex-convicts were legally barred from living.  Spieler provides a map in her book in the chapter entitled “Missing Persons,” if you can obtain a copy of the book.  If you get a chance to look at that map, it’s actually stunning the amount of territory that was legally off-limits for ex-convicts to live in (it’s something like 80 percent of the country).  Spieler explains one of the driving justifications for a growing police state after the Revolution was a pervasive fear of “the ex-convict”:\n\n >  The figure who menaced French society of the early nineteenth century more than any other was the ex-convict.  Liberated felons elicited panic and repulsion among officials and members of the public.  From the 1820s forward, ex-convicts became the object of legal and administrative procedures of rising complexity.  Artful police measures arranged for their expulsion from towns and whole departments.  Law acted in conjunction with police power to shape and underclass of hunted and placeless vagabonds (14).\n\nThis, of course, is one of the reasons French Guiana developed as a penal colony in the first place: the state had effectively imposed spatial limits on the entirety of metropolitan France such that convicts could not physically remain there.  But it also sheds an interesting contextual light on Jean Valjean's continual struggle with Javert and his criminal past, and it shows the extent to which Victor Hugo definitely did his homework when writing the novel.\n\nAs to whether or not convicts were used to drydock ships, I can't say, but you have to admit it makes for good symbolic theatre.",
                "An answer about physics rather than history: moving a boat isn't nearly as difficult as one would believe. I regularly move a 100 metric tons river boat by hand alone, without too much effort. It's very slow but not very athletic.\n\nSo not only is it realistic, it's not nearly as grueling as one might believe.",
                "If I may tack on a question:\nI understood the [scene](_URL_0_) as the recovery of a warship that was heavily damaged in one of the last naval battles of the Napoleonic Wars, symbolized by the French tricolor being dragged through the water while still attached to the mast. Would that assumption be correct?\n",
                "I hadn't popped into this thread because I have never seen/read \"Les Miserables,\" but since /u/SerLaron added in a clip of the scene, I think I can comment intelligently on this. \n\nFirst off, this is clearly something that's being dramatized for, uh, dramatic effect. They're showing a ship with at least one mast trailing in the water and a significant list (lean) being dragged into a dry dock, apparently during a storm, while loose rigging and ropes (and that tricolor) drag in the water. Waves are breaking over the men in the dock (boy, you'd think that ship would keep them out) while they strain to pull the ship towards them (you'd also think that if the wind/waves were blowing into the dock, they'd be running for their lives to get out of the way as the ship is thrown inward). All of this is pretty tremendously implausible; loose rigging would be cut off the ship so it could be sailed back to safety, and no one in his right mind would try to move a ship into a dock when there was a storm going on (what exactly is controlling the stern of the ship and preventing it from slamming into the sides of the drydock?)\n\nI can't really tell what kind of vessel it is from the quick flyover, but it's definitely ship-rigged (that is, it has three masts set with square sails). A ship-of-the-line of the Napoleonic period would draw let's say 20-24 feet of water, and likely more if it was damaged/leaking/listing. (You can compare this to the draft of [this model of HMS Victory](_URL_0_) -- granted, the Victory was/is a very large ship of the line, but there's substantially more that would be underwater than what they're showing there. \n\nWhich means that the guys in the bottom of the dry dock would be covered in quite a bit of water -- the ship has to float into it first, of course, and only then can the dock sealed and water be pumped out. \n\nNow, using manpower to move a ship into a dock is not at all unrealistic, but from what I've read, it would be more likely that the ship would be warped into the dock using the standard way of moving ships around not under sail -- which is to say that you'd run a line or lines from the ship to shore and use the standard force multiplier on a ship (the [capstan](_URL_1_)) to apply force and pull the ship forward. You could do that either with a fixed point on the dock, or by say taking an anchor out into a ship's boat, dropping it, and pulling the ship up to it. (Another [capstan pic](_URL_2_), from the USS Constitution.) It's not at all impossible that convicts could be used for heaving on the capstan, but I can't see what's being depicted in the scene as being realistic and/or efficient. \n\n"

I've seen health plans with Out of Pocket maximums in the 6 digit range.\n\nExample - a member has a HDHP with a 30,000 OOP maximum. Even though the plan might pay, let's say, $470,000 worth of the expenses, the patient would still be liable for the remaining 30k.\n\nThis is all pretty simplified, but it gives the basic idea. there's also the possibility that the patient is receiving services which are not covered for one reason or another, and those would not count towards their OOP max.",

                "I touched on this question a bit [here](_URL_0_). To paraphrase the part relevant to your question: Languages diverge due to isolation and exposure to other languages. Afrikaans (or \"Cape Dutch\"), for a more recent example, came about due to isolation from its mother tongue and exposure to other languages. This was able to happen quickly because South Africa was a fairly difficult place to reach easily by the Europeans and the Dutch speaking majority of European settlers were surrounded by the English, Portuguese, and indigenous African population (Khoisan, mostly).\n\nAs the mass, global media came about, Afrikaans took on more English loanwords.\n\nThe same person in that thread asked specifically about Swiss and German dialects of German and if the media is merging those two together. This is where morphology took a funny turn: With higher ( > 99%) literacy and more text-based communication, spoken language is more of a *cultural* thing, so your question can't simply be answered with, \"Well, divergence is decreasing or divergence is increasing.\" The languages continue to diverge due to cultural isolation, but some aspects are *con*verging due to higher international communication— basic (conversational) communication continues to stand alone while more technical communication is merging.\n\nWhat will the linguistic landscape look like in 100 years? It's impossible to tell, but it's highly unlikely we'll see, say, Swedish and Norwegian becoming closer because Swedish will be *Swedish*. Instead, with globalized media and better education, we're more likely to see a greater understanding of foreign languages— the Swiss will still speak their own version of German while they *learn* German German as an alternative. We can see this with Scandinavian languages and English dialects: Norwegians just learn Danish and they communicate in their own native tongues respectively and they understand each other perfectly. With globalized and social media, Americans are fully capable to understand the English without changing the way they speak.\n\nSo will they eventually *con*verge? Give it 1000 years and we'll see what happens. But as it is now, we're actually becoming more multilingual, which isn't doing much to slow the divergence of languages."

                "The important thing to understand is that in the 1920s/1930s there was no 'tuition fee' (as we understand them now) to attend Oxford - rather your outgoings would have comprised living costs, and expenses related to your stay at one of the constituent colleges (known as battels*). These expenses put education at this university out of reach for the vast majority of the population, save the independently wealthy.\n\nI imagine if 'Gatsby' applied to a college that deemed him a sufficient fit, with the ability to demonstrate financial stability in order to stay the course, AND he passed the university-wide mandatory Latin exam before matriculation, then they would allow him entry.\n\nI've not heard of US troops being allowed 'scholarships' at Oxford colleges on the basis of their service, until the latter half of the last century the central University wouldn't have had enough clout to demand colleges accept these kind of scholars. Undergraduate admissions was (and still is) managed by the various autonomous colleges and halls that make up the 'collegiate university'.\n\nSource: Robert Anderson, *British Universities Past and Present* (London, Hambledon Continuum: 2006)\n\nRecommended reading if you are interested in social developments at Oxford during the long 19th century: Goldman, Laurence (1995) *Dons and Workers*. Oxford: Oxford UP\n\n*EDIT: [Useful blog post from Oxford University Press](_URL_0_) which explains what battels are, whilst shedding light on some other Oxford lingo.\n",
                "Maybe the exact quote from the book would help someone with more knowledge of history than me come to a clear answer. \n\n“It was an opportunity they gave to some of the officers after the Armistice,” he continued. “We could go to any of the universities in England or France.”\n\nI cant speak to whether or not this actually happened in real life but be aware that Gatsby only says that because he needs to find an excuse how he could have went there. \n\nRemember, most of Gatsby's background is a fabrication. Earlier in the story he claimed he went to Oxford because \"all his ancestors have been educated there for many years. It is a family tradition.\" This is when he is still claiming to have come from a wealthy family in the Midwest. \n\nLater in the novel, when pressured about being an Oxford man by Tom Cavanaugh he has to admit he was only there 5 months and now changes his story that he got this opportunity because of his military service. Neither Jordan or Tom are ever convinced he went there. Even Nick, after hearing Gatsby say he \"was brought up in America but educated at Oxford,\" notices Gatsby is uncomfortable about saying as much and believes him to be lying.\n\nTL:DR I am not sure of the validity of this practice, but it is almost certainly a lie by Gatsby to cover his tracks when people realize he couldn't have gone there\n\n",

A good heuristic is that real effects tend to become amplified as controls and sample sizes are improved, and noise / false positives tend to go away.

I.E. an unfamiliar asian who no one recognizes from previous jail time comes onto the block - the asians will talk to him and feel him out. If he sounds or looks fishy they will ask him for his paperwork or arrest reports (very common to have in jail as you can keep legal paperwork on your person at all times, and this is basically your credentials like we would carry a drivers license). If they don't have these documents, and they're asked to provide them - in decent jail culture they will allow the inmate to ask their case worker for copies of these documents. If they still are not provided after a day or two then the are marked a \"skinner\" which is a child rapist. \n\nGenerally, when these people enter the prison system they are offered the chance (and highly encouraged) to go into protective custody - as the prison is responsible for the \"care, custody and control\" of the inmate population.

For example, the drosophila fruit fly’s genome is entirely sequenced, and the thing’s been studied for over a century.  These flies also have a simple genome and yet very little genetic drift.\n\nAdded to that, the same family is available to almost every lab in the world.\n\nAs for how they’re used: they’re used in genetic experiments, breeding experiments, environmental experiments and more — I first used them in school when I was 10 to plot population growth and decline.\n\nThey may be small, but they’re still huge on the genetic scale, as well as under the microscope— and most of the time it’s a population of flies that is studied more than individual flies.

                "My guess would be that intelligent people understand the things that are wrong in their lives, where a not-so-intelligent guy just plodding along doesn't really know what's wrong.  And if you can articulate those problems, the worse you feel.\n\nI think it even goes beyond just intelligent/non-intelligent people.  I read a book on the American food system and now buying meat makes me pause; my friend hasn't read this book, and when she goes to buy meat, she doesn't go through the same mental calculations I do.  \n\nAnother friend of mine reads a lot of feminist blogs, but the more she reads, the more frustrated she gets with the whole situation.  She's really well-read and very articulate, but she has such a solid grasp of the patriarchy/feminism/etc, that she can't help but see those patterns in everyday life.  I can see some of them, but I'm not as well-read and not as frustrated.  \n\nAnd so on.  Just a guess, though!",
                "I'm going to assume you don't actually need an ELI5 answer, but I'll try to give you one - after I'm finished being verbose.\n\n\nDepression (and that doesn't necessarily have to mean clinical depression, but any emotional state of sadness) is a hotly-debated topic, given that it toes the line between neurochemistry and psychology; there is no conclusive evidence on why some people are plagued with constant regret or guilt. Sometimes we're able to draw links between hormone imbalances or other medical factors, while other times the genesis of depression can be purely psychological. \n\n\nAs you can imagine, that makes any studies or findings sure to be contested upon release. Currently, [specialists speculate](_URL_0_) that depression is an evolutionary addition to the human psyche that enables better problem resolution; studies have shown that people in melancholy states of mind are (generally) less judgemental, can better assess the accuracy and truth of rumours, and have enhanced access to long-term memory. \n\n\nSome results are quite remarkable: a psychiatry professor at John Hopkins found that, \"successful individuals were eight times as likely as people in the general population to suffer from major depressive illness.\" Similarly, a psychologist at the University of South Wales found that, \"sadness promotes “information-processing strategies best suited to dealing with more-demanding situations.\"\n\n\n**In short,** sadness is a possible evolutionary development to ensure human progress; by lamenting failures, we are able to focus our mental faculties on fixing faults (be they real or perceived), improving on imperfection, and preparing for future attempts at success. This ties into our natural fear of disappointing others or being publicly shamed, as these events only make us re-examine how we have let others down and how to improve. Intelligent people tend to be more aware of their missteps, whereas those of average intelligence or below-average intelligence may not be (hence the old saying, \"ignorance is bliss\"). This is not to say that people who are not highly-intelligent cannot be sad or depressed, but their response mechanisms tend to be different.\n\n\nOf course, there are exceptions to the above. There are cases of depression where people stop functioning completely, or overcome their survival instinct and kill themselves; clearly, sadness cannot be touted as a purely beneficial evolution, seeing that it is perfectly capable of driving people to failure itself instead of away from it. \n\n\n**ELI5/TL;DR:** smart people are sad more often because they are afraid to make others mad at them or not do something right.

                "I have had this discussion with my SO a few times.\n\n I am (relative to people in my area) intelligent but am pretty happy overall, even with some grasp on how terrible everything is in the world at large and here in America. He is also intelligent (in the actual IQ test sort of way) and occasionally really frustrated and quite often literally emotionally burdened by all the things humans can accomplish if we could straighten the fuck up and quit fighting about stupid shit, so we could progress.  \n\nOn the other end of the spectrum is our friend of lesser-but-average intelligence, whom I shall call \"David.\"\nDavid is chipper in a way I have not seen since I was in junior high. Full grown dude, naive as heck and willing to drop everything for his friends and even friends of friends. He makes his own music, has a wife and toddler, and a job you wouldn't think would be satisfying. And though he has responsibilities to take care of, mouths to feed and bills to pay, not to mention having been burned by those who would take advantage of David's kindness, he is the same. I have only seen him upset when participating in intellectual conversations, and even then he looks for solutions and bright sides.\n\nAs others have pointed out, intelligence opens your eyes. The example I have right now would be like when you are a child and the world is fun and bright and great. As you grow older you learn more and more about bad things that have happened, all the bad fortune that can fall upon you at a moments notice, and injustices and war and political whatnots. The world can seem really dark, very cruel. It's kind of like that.\n\nI hope I always have a little childhood and play left in me, so I can share the good things with my children and remind my boyfriend of how awesome things can be when he gets down.\n\n(Sorry this is super long. I really wanted to throw my 2 cents in.)\n",
                "The thing is, BamBam, that life is like a football game.  Your dad takes you to the stadium, you feel the excitement of the crowds, you find your seat, you get a bag of peanuts and the game is about to start.  You and your dad's favorite team are getting ready to play, and life is Grand.\n\nYour pop, who is your hero and your best friend, gives you the work up; what players to watch, what's at stake, the whole reason of why this game is everything to him.  You take it all in and are as excited as he is because your Dad is excited, so It Must Be Important. \n\nKickoff, cheers, boos, the game goes on and some loser is getting drunk and spoiling it for everyone.  Your dad drinks, maybe too much at home or on certain days, but you know the loser is getting out of hand because of the booze.  Does your dad get out of hand because of booze?  Seeing it in a new perspective is weird, focus on the game and enjoy yourself.\n\nHalftime.  Gotta use the facilities and the lines are long, especially for your kid sized bladder. Somebody gripes about how the box seats don't have to wait in line, and you remember asking your Pop earlier about those folks who are in the boxes.  Your old man grumps, they are greedy people who wear suits and don't deserve those perks, don't you mind them.  But they don't have to wait in line, you think, you don't see them in the lines waiting for drinks or food or restrooms.  Why do some people get to wait in line where others gets the box seats.  Your turn, take care of business and get back to your seat. \n\nThe game progresses, the sun gets hotter and your team is losing.  Why?  Aren't we the hardest working, best peopling, best coaching, super history, deservingest team ever?  Someone mentions how the other team got some super duper player, the one who is spoiling everything for Your Team, and we could have had them if we could have given him more money.  Why wouldn't someone play for our Best Team?  For Free?  Don't make any sense, and your hungry.  Your Pop hands you a $5 bill and you go looking for the snack bar.\n\nYou get lost and find yourself in the storage area.  Some of the food is obviously spoiled but you see people take it out to be sold anyway.  You go back knowing that someone is going home with a tummy ache, or worse. \n\nGame ends.  Home team lost, Dad is ticked, everyone is grumbling, you think you hear some little kid complaining about how his stomach hurts.  Takes forever to get home.  Somebody turns on the TV and another game is on.  You sit on the couch, and football isn't the same anymore.  Your now know that the drama includes all the people in the stadium, everyone is subject to stuff out of their control and life is not as simple as buying a ticket and enjoying the game. \n\n",

                "Intelligent people can see through this mundane and bullshit existence for what it really is.",
                "The more intelligent you are the more questions you ask to yourself.Like you question why am i here ? where did i come from ? why do i exists ? Then for quenching your thirst you start to read more. You read about evolution and how you are just a product of evolution through millions of years.Nothing matters. You are here because you are here.You don't matter because nothing matters. Life doesn't matter nor does death.Then you go back to the first question again. WHY ? and there is no answer because there isn't .Sadness.",
                "Basically, the idea is that intelligent people are more aware/better understand various things, and the more they understand the more they see problems. People who understand economics see what a shithole the US is in, people who are aware of world affairs see all the tragedy and horror that occurs, people who get politics see how absurd our current process is. People who \"aren't intelligent\" either don't get it or just don't know about it, and therefore can't be perturbed by things they don't know/understand. \n\n\nAs a secondary point, my brain is very active. I think about things way too much. As such, when I am not occupied I automatically start analyzing things and the more I do, the worse I end up feeling. Nearly anything can be very depressing if you think enough about it. ",
                "Suppose that suddenly the world and all its important decisions are managed by kindergarteners. would you be happier or less happy in this world?\n\n\nthat is how smart people feel... all the time.",
                "I think - and this is from personal experience, so I can't give citations - that there's also the element of boredom/lack of challenge in there.\n\nOur ancestors were challenged every day. Wild animals are as well. How am I going to eat? How am I going to avoid being eaten? How am I going to procreate?\n\nModern life takes most of that away. For most of us, the most we have to worry about is what trousers to wear today or whether to have coffee or tea. When we're not challenged in life, we internalise challenges and create our own. Why did she leave me? Why will I always be alone? Why does everyone hate me? The problem with these challenges is that they're almost impossible to solve, and so they build frustration and you don't get the normal good feeling of completion once they're removed.\n\nThe more intelligent you are, the fewer external challenges life provides (because things are easier) and the more you internalise. So an intelligent person gets bored and unhappy unless they find the right challenges.\n\nSo, for example, you have a bloke in a normal 9-5 job and he hates it because it's easy, so he gets depressed and cuts himself off and doesn't go out looking for other challenges and it self perpetuates. Another person in the same job enjoys it because to him it's more of a challenge, so he leaves fulfilled at the end of the day and can put himself in situations which challenge him in other ways, so he's able to maintain that happiness.\n\nUnhappy man finds a job that challenges him. Because he's in the habit (i.e. the pathways of his brain are developed to push him into particular learned behaviour) he focuses himself in it completely. He gets a bit happier but only has one challenge in life and he sees it as the only way to keep happy. He still avoids other challenges because he's afraid of being bored and unhappy again, and as far as he can see the only cure is this new job.\n\nThe solution? More dangerous wild animals everywhere to keep us all on our toes. Why do you think Australians are so happy?\n\nSeriously, though, the secret is to always challenge yourself. My mantra has long been \"it's no fun unless it's hard\", and that stands me in good stead in pretty much every situation in life.",
                "Because sometimes, you feel like you have to fix all the problems in the world. There's this unstated societal expectation, this pressure, that \"smart\" people should, no, *will* and *must* fix everything. There's this constant underlying guilt, this \"why didn't I do better?\" You feel as though the world is counting on you. But not everyone is lucky, not everyone can cure cancer, create a vaccine for AIDS, end war, discover alien life forms, engineer time travel, make the world a better place. Sometimes, it's hard being intelligent. Sometimes, you wish that you could be dumb and happy, not expected to save the world. ",
                "I was a little bit surprised when I ctrl-f'd to find that nobody had said **Ignorance is Bliss.**\n\nI think anyone would be more depressed if they actually understood more about the world around them, it often has little to do with actual intelligence.",

                "Well, intelligence can have two different meanings. \n\n1. An achieved intelligence, in which you learn these things through experience and/or practice.\n\n1. An intelligence from simply having a high aptitude. You can't learn this, but you are born with it. \n\nIMO, I think that in Hemingway's quote that you have provided, he was speaking in the sense of aptitude. Now, to be born with a higher aptitude can seem wonderful, but it depends on the perspective you look at. \n\nImagine being good at things immediately, getting everything on your first try, and impressing people your entire life. To the outsider it seems like a wonderful gift, but it can be very different to whoever contains whatever the abilities may be. Now imagine always being different then your peers, separated. It would be hard to try to fit in because, well, people with gifts, usually lack what others commonly have, whether it be social skills, or chemical imbalance in the brain (could lead to depression itself).Not all people with abnormally high aptitudes are like this, but imo and experience most are.Hopefully one is not to take their abilities for granite but with every gift is a downside and vice versa. \n\nKind of like a celebrity, not in the sense that everyone loves you and all that but, the average person see's a celebrity, adores them, and wishes that they too could have fame, but the celebrity always says, yes the fame is nice, but i wish i had some privacy or somewhere along those lines. Not only this, but this average person doesn't look at the celebrity as a person, but as a celebrity, and acts accordingly. I can only conclude that this separation from the category of human, can only lead to why so many children stars grow up to be at a lot of times somewhat \"off\" and dysfunctional. They haven't developed how one normally should; \"with\" the people. \n\nWe are social creatures, and when someone isn't like us, it's like an invisible wall that forms. No matter what the difference is, the invisible wall will affect you. "

                "Because it has a large cross section for neutron capture. If I remember correctly, boron captures a neutron and decays to lithium and an alpha particle.\n\nIt's just one of those things that happens. You can more or less show how it happens if you calculate the cross sections of different elements. For boron it happens to be quite high.\n\nedit: the neutron cross section also depends quite heavily on the energy of the neutron, so boron is probably quite suited to the typical energy scales found in certain types of reactors (e.g. slow/fast neutrons).",
                "Boron-10 (specifically) has a high neutron capture cross section; this means there is a high probability that B-10 will pick up a neutron as it collides with the nucleus. This probability changes with the energy level of the free neutron in question, where B-10 has the highest chance to pick up slow (thermal) neutrons.\n\nTo answer why one must consider the stability of the nuclide before colliding with a neutron.\n\nB-10 has 5 neutrons. Similarly to electrons, nucleons follow a shell model, although it is different for the nucleus of an atom. Paired neutrons (and paired protons) are favorable and lower the energy of the nucleus. This means an even number of neutrons is more stable than an odd number of neutrons, as in B-10. When B-10 picks up a neutron it becomes B-11, which has 6 neutrons, making the nucleus more stable. Because of this extra stability, B-11 makes up about 80% of all natural boron. If B-11 were to pick up a new neutron it would again have an odd number of neutrons (B-12), and would increase in energy. B-12 is not a stable nuclide; in fact, a single neutron in B-12 will decay into a proton, electron, and an anti electron nutrino with a half life of 22 miliseconds. To further demonstrate the difference between the two probabilities, B-10 has a capture cross section of 0.5 +/- 0.1 barns (common unit for this measurement), while B-11 has a cross section of 5.5 +/- 3.3 milibarns. So B-10 has a capture cross section almost one hundred times that of B-11 (_URL_0_)\n\nThis mode of decay, termed beta minus decay, occurs when a nucleus has too many neutrons compared to protons. All isotopes of boron above B-11 have a neutron:proton ratio that is too high, and they all decay through this method. This means it doesn't matter if these heavier isotopes have an even or odd number of neutrons, they are going to decay.\n\nBut because both B-10 and B-11 are stable, B-10 may pick up a neutron and lower in energy without decaying. There are no negatives to this nuclear reaction, therefore it has a high chance of occuring, unlike the reaction B-11 + n - >  B-12\n\nSimilarly to how electron shells have magic closed shell numbers (think nobel gases), so do nuclear shells. This does not concern the B-10 - >  B-11 nuclear reaction, but it does govern the neutron capture cross section for other elements. If a nuclide has a magic number of neutrons, it will have a very low chance to pick up another (similar to the low reactivity of nobel gases). If a nuclide has n-1 magic number of neutrons, it will have a very high chance to pick up another neutron (similar to the reactivity of the halogens).\n\nSo, analogous to electrons, one must consider the stability of the nucleus before and after picking up a neutron to determine if the process will be highly favorable, or unlikely to happen.",
                "Some examples of neutron absorbers include boron, (used in bwr control rods, and also used as a liquid poison for PWRs for normal operation and bwrs for extreme emergencies only), gadolinium (installed in fuel as a built in poison to prevent new fuel from being depleted too rapidly, allows 2 year fuel cycles), silver-indium-cadmium (used in many PWR control rods), hafnium (used in some bwr and PWR control rods, known for its ability to perform several neutron absorptions per unit prior to depletion). \n\nThere are also poisons that build up in the fuel during operation such as samarium and xenon.

The balkan states have massive unemployment and lots of people have no faith about their future life in their homecountry. The traffic gangs gave them hope for a better life in Germany. In September/October 15 up to 40% of refugees were people from the balkan states, who barely have chances to get accepted. The german government started some campaigns ( \"noone from the balkans will be accepted\" ) in those states and there were remarkably less people from the balkan states starting from November 15.\n\n3) People around the globe hear about the asylum situation in Europe. They read about the fact, that only few people are sent back to their homecountries even in case they are refused asylum. The government accepts them being in the country, as long as they are not being criminal. Sending back criminals is incredibly difficult as you can see in the example below. Word spreads fast with Internet being around everywhere and even people from Africa can imagine a better life in Europe, because \"all\" they have to do is getting to Europe. \n\nSomething to note:  Some people are actually send back, but it is a very, very small number.\n\nOne \"trick\" is not to bring a passport with them, so they can't possibly be sent back. Imagine this situation:\n\nGermany: \"Hey Senegal, we have some people from your country and we would like sending them back, but we are not entirely sure about their origin. Can you please take them back ? \"\n\nSenegal: \" Oh no germany, those guys are probably from the Ivory Coast, better ask them \"\n\nGermany goes to the Ivory Coast and asks the same question.\n\nIvory Coast: \"Oh no, those guys are probably from Nigeria, better ask them\"\n\nAnd the never ending cycle begins, especially if those guys are criminals with no passports. Which country wants to take back their criminals ? Or criminals with an unknown origin ?"

                "This is a stereotype popular mostly in the USA, and it is more nuanced than that. It encompasses the idea that Scandinavians (particularily Swedes) are beautiful, kind of naive, innocently sexually attractive and sexually liberated. \n\nIts part of a larger stereotype that Europeans are more sexually liberated (and presumably desirable), than Americans.\n*(Notably, this stereotype is not particularily popular in Europe, where the role of a \"sexy foreigner\" in popular media is usually filled by Slavic women and Mediterrean men, not Scandinavians.)*\n\nIts hard to pin an exact date on when this stereotype appeared, but its most likely after 1960, when examples of (often sexually explicit) Scandinavian cinema reached the US.\n\nSource:\n\n*Scandinavian Blue: The Erotic Cinema of Sweden and Denmark in the 1960*\n\n*Rohner, Jean-Christohpe; Rasmussen, Anders. \"Recognition bias and the physical attractiveness stereotype\". Scandinavian Journal of Psychology 53*",
                "Not sure if this answers directly to your question as you're asking about the existence of *a stereotype*, but from what we know about the Eurasian slave trade we could get at least some idea how blond Nordic people were seen in the southern parts of medieval and pre-modern Eurasia.\n\nA relevant paper: [The Baltic Finnic People in the Medieval and Pre-Modern Eastern European Slave Trade](_URL_1_)  \nAlso this blogpost gives context and details with more sources: [Blonde cargoes: Finnish children in the slave markets of medieval Crimea](_URL_0_)  \n\nCrimea was the center of the Black Sea slave trade. In the Crimean markets blonde girls and boys captured from Finland and Karelia were the most valued slaves because of the color of their skin and hair. And their exceedingly high value made it worthwhile to capture them in the North and to transport them to these far-away markets. \n\n >  The prices they commanded, however, were simply colossal; one source notes that girls who could be purchased for as little as 5 altyn in Karelia could be resold for 6,666 altyn even before they reached the Khanate – a mark up in excess of 133,000 percent. The higher price, equivalent to 200 roubles or (in about 1600) 250 sheep, was also about five times the usual price for a Crimean slave. It is no surprise, in these circumstances, that slaves from the far north were highly sought-after for their colouring – nor that their special characteristics were scrupulously noted in the slave registers so carefully kept in the ports that lay at the heart of this commerce in human misery: “white skin, white hair.”\n\nOf course, there are many factors into a price: rarity, exotism, luxury etc. yet the high prices tell us these slaves were also valued for their beauty. And the participants on the slave markets must have been informed about them as there was networks for capturing, transporting and trading these blonde slaves. \n\nSo the clientele knew about these people, sometimes even seeking after them in the markets (for example, Shāh Abbās of Persia sent out delegations to slave markets that acquired three Finnish girls in Moscow and 30 more in Kazan), the slave traders knew where to get them, and raids were extendend as far as the coast of the Gulf of Bothnia in Finland to capture blonde boys and girls. \n\nBut I'm not sure if that qualifies as a stereotype in the sense you were asking about.",
                "I'll answer part of your question. In Hollywood, the \"blonde bombshell\" female ideal which is ascribed to Scandinavian women took hold ca 1930-1933. The 1920s were the era of the boyish and flat-chested Flappers, who had short, dark hair - in 1933 silver-blonde Jean Harlow broke through to be the #1 female film star, and Fay Wray got to wear a blonde wig for her role in King Kong.  \nSwedish-born Greta Garbo (who had light brown hair) was already a star, topping the charts with Grand Hotel in 1932, and Carol Lombard had her hair bleached for a number of hit comedies from 1930-1936.\n\nSources: \n\n* Barnaby Conrad, The Blonde: An Illustrated History of the Golden Era from Harlow to Monroe\n* Rooney  &  Viera, Harlow in Hollywood\n* [Pictures of 1930s stars and their \"Hollywood Makeover\"](_URL_0_)",

                "It is not fully understood by science but much research points towards some form of serotonin deficiency, in either its production or turnover in our bodies. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that we synthesise from the tryptophan we eat in our food and helps us regulate mood. Whilst poor diet can clearly contribute it is also clear that certain experienced events can also disturb our brain chemistry. Generally speaking that emptiness will also coincide with a lower level of serotonin or an ineffectiveness of the serotonin receptors in our brain to process it.",
                "There's a lot of complex answers here and not really ELI5\n\nI think an easy way is to think how our thoughts, feelings, behaviours and even physical sensations are all linked with one another\n\nWhen we see something we don't like we almost automatically go into fight or flight, to help deal with the situation\n\nPart of that process involves our brain turning off our digestion so that it can use that energy somewhere more helpful\n\nTurning off our digestion can feel a bit funny in your belly",
                "Research shows that the hippocampus (underneath the brain's cerebrum) dictates the appropriate behaviour for your current mood. Chronic depression has been shown to shrink the size of the hippocampus and so make it hard to moderate mood. \n\nThis is also part of the autobiographic memory network - used to think within one's self. This moderates self-contained thoughts. The problem arises when you consider that another network, the cognitive control network, almost becomes innate whilst the autobiographic is turned on. We use cognitive control to focus, retain important information and complete tasks as well as rationalise thought. Inversely, the autobiographic also helps us formulate mental images and imagination. So the shrinking of part of it can make positive thoughts or probl solving difficult from a practical standpoint.\n\nEssentially, dopamine helps us dictate (note - this is Action Selection Theory and though generally accepted, has yet to be further proven) which action to take through 'thresholds'. Simply understand that everything has a 'potential' to create energy. Our body measures that potential and reacts based on the different strengths of potential. Dopamine binds with the 'basal ganglia' to activate a response across neurons. Everytime this works, the basal ganglia is 'rewired' to make the dopamine easier to bind to, allowing the successful behaviour to be repeated.\n\nThis is in essence what hormones are doing. When depressed, the levels of dopamine released and required become problematic. We cannot activate the correct 'potentials' to create reactions which let us make productive decisions. We cannot access the cognitive control network efficiently and so we become stuck in a negative feedback loop. Without the dopamine (and sometimes seratonin), we find it hard to concentrate, visualise and so find solutions or ways to vocalise how we are feeling, making us sadder. \n\nI'm no expert, this is all fairly simplified and I'm sure to some extent fallacy, feel free to correct any errors in my understanding.",
                "What causes any feeling?\n\nThe body (including the brain) is one complex machine, with a tangled history of biochemistry and evolution. Everything serves more than one purpose, and every purpose is served by more than one thing. Genetic templates rendered useless by a new ecological niche aren't often just thrown away, instead they're repurposed.\n\nThis is mostly conjecture, but sadness is mostly about lack, about absence or loss, that is, dissatisfaction. It's the sort of emotion that our ancestors would've had, hundreds of thousands of generations ago, before we had this whole massive abstract thought and long-term prediction engine bolted on, with all its capacity to feel sad over metaphysical absences. Our pre-lizard hind-brains, the fight-flight-feed-fuck machines, aren't terribly changed since then, so... as silly as it sounds to say it like this, I think that this particular deep flavor of sadness **might literally be a form of hunger**, your body reacts to and communicates this the expected way.\n\nEvery emotion is, on some level, a tool for DNA to use to make its vehicle perform better at making more of that same DNA. Hunger is a powerful one, because food is a fundamental need. Of course it'd be repurposed. Depression is probably an extreme failure mode of a mechanism designed to say, \"This environment is not fulfilling you [ie, providing what you need to replicate me], seek a different one.\"",
                "So I can't give a scientific answer of the actual biological components at play, but I can give a practical answer because I have struggled with this for some time.  The nervous system has multiple states it can be in - fight, flight, or freeze.  When you're in a depressed state, you are most likely in a freeze state, which can be thought of as a low energy, \"stuck\" state - think of a frozen animal in the wild.  Along with these states, the mind has multiple coping mechanisms to deal with the painful feelings associated with whatever it is one is going through.  One very common reaction is to disconnect, or dissociate from ones self in order to protect the mind and body from the painful or uncomfortable feelings associated what the situation.  When in this state, you are disconnected from your body - your feelings, your desires, your basic self.  That, to me, could very easily described as a feeling of \"emptiness\" because when not in that state, you are likely \"filled\" with all sorts of thoughts, feelings, and emotions.",
                "I am curious to know if people with a heightened awareness of understanding one one-self would be able to conquer depression.\n\nPerhaps that sounds a little dumb, but if one understands how to make oneself happy but ***chooses*** to continue to do things to stay down under can it still be considered \"clinical depression\".",
                "You project how you feel now into the future, your mind is always projecting and adding your current feelings into its subconscious simulations of the future. If it's one of no growth or negative growth, you are going to feel defeated, pointless, down. As you are literally going down from whatever stable high you were before. And it's all perspective. Wise people try to live a stable life with little to no highs. What goes up. Comes down.\n\nBad feelings are the experience of negative PERSPECTIVE, good feelings are visa versa.\n\nPain is an overload of sensation. Pain doesn't really exist. Lower the input of \"pain\" and it becomes a gentle sensation, like someone stroking your skin. A tingle, higher it, and it becomes unbearable.",
                "Your brain is like a room full of fun floating balloons that you love and they always keep you happy. The happy balloons only float for a certain amount of time and then they go all flat, fall back to the ground, and then get filled up with fun air again and float back to the top! The happiness cycle starts again! There are always full balloons in the room so you’re always able to feel happiness!\n\nWhen you’re depressed, what happens is, the floor of your room unfortunately breaks and falls away and there’s just a big, black hole in the ground. Your fun, happy balloons deflate like normal but instead of sitting on the ground to inflate again, they fall into the dark hole and get lost. It can take ages for you to rebuild the floor so you might not be happy for a long time, but rest assured that with hard work you can get the bricks back down and get some balloons back in there so the cycle of inflating and deflating can return again like normal! \n\nThe balloons in this case are actually a happy chemical called serotonin; your brain sometimes forgets how to keep serotonin inside itself properly like the room in the story above, so people feel a kind of sadness. Some tablets you take can help you keep the serotonin in your brain and stop it from vanishing into the black hole, which helps you regain happiness and rebuild that floor so your brain can keep the serotonin around by itself!",

                "Obtaining a doctorate in clinical psychology and have clinical depression:\n\nSerotonin is absolutely a contributing factor because it plays a key role in everyday life (sex, behavior, sleep, memory, etc...) to the feeling of emptiness but it’s not the only neurotransmitter. Norepinephrine also plays a huge role that’s often overlooked in patients with depression. It mobilizes the brain and body for action. Then we have dopamine for motivation and oxytocin (aka the love hormone). \n\nThe feeling of emptiness is usually accompanied by isolation, whether self imposed or circumstantial, and a lack of good support (healthy relationships with friends and family; participation in the community; feelings of success in education and career). \n\nSo let’s break it down into a cycle of depression and give a general look at what starts to happen:\n\nLet’s say Albert is working 60 hours a week at a desk job. He stays late to work hard on projects, comes home, makes dinner, watches his shows, gets ready for bed, and that’s his entire work week. Albert doesn’t have a romantic partner and has been single for a year or more. He had a nasty divorce but he somehow powered through and kept working at his job because he knew that’s what he needed to do. \n\nAlbert, just like everyone else, has a different rate of processing stress. After the divorce he felt relief but six months later, Albert finds himself feeling stuck. He’s slipping behind on his work, deadlines are getting harder to achieve. Albert isn’t sleeping as well as he did before and he’s not eating the healthy diet he had a year before. \n\nAlbert continues on like this for another month. Everything starts to puke up on him. Bills aren’t being paid on time, he’s not doing well at work, his boss starts remarking on his poor work, even though he’s doing the same amount of work as he did before he started falling into depression. \n\nAlbert doesn’t know he’s depressed and continues on for a few more months. His work gets worse, he’s not getting rewarded for his hard work, he’s constantly getting negative feedback, and then the divorce starts to become a reality because he realizes he hasn’t hugged anyone in over a year let alone have sex since well before the divorce. \n\nHe looks at himself in the mirror and the once chipper Albert he knew from 5 maybe 10 years ago is gone. He starts believing he’s a shadow of his former self. He lost interest in his hobbies, he doesn’t want to join his coworkers on nights out to get drinks, he declines his friends to hang out, and he starts to believe he deserves this. \n\nAlbert continues on because he has to. He has bills, student loans, a mortgage, payments to his divorce lawyer, lost all his family heirlooms because his ex decided to destroy everything that meant something to him. And now, Albert has put some weight on because he doesn’t want to go for walks anymore. He stopped going to the gym even though he’s still paying for his membership. \n\nAlbert starts to smile less. He starts to not care about the way he looks or smells anymore. He can’t explain why he’s crying every night and he begins to feel empty inside, like he’s not able to do anything right because he’s messing up his entire life and he doesn’t know how to stop it. \n\nNow there’s a bunch of research, medications, and paths Albert can take, but he doesn’t know where to start because now fear is taking over and driving him to the ground. \n\nWhat we can learn from Albert is that emptiness doesn’t just happen over night. It’s a succession of little things that seem meaningless in the moment but actually mean a lot to the health of a functioning brain. When social, emotional, career, and hobbies are pushed to the side along with isolation, because Albert doesn’t want to burden his friends, family, or coworkers with his problems, that escalates to emptiness. \n\nLosing touch with friends and family is a huge factor in depression and the feeling of emptiness. There’s the reward center in our brains that tells us “I loved doing such and such with so and so, that was really fun!” Hugging someone and feeling loved is also apart of this. Hugging produces oxytocin and dopamine, which rewards the brain and makes it say “yay! We had a meaningful exchange with someone! That felt great!” Not having those things makes someone feel empty and like a shadow of who they used to be. \n\nThis is just one of so many examples of how emptiness during a depressive episode manifests. \n\nAlbert tried his best despite his circumstances and he didn’t reach out because he was scared of the stigma around mental health issues. He didn’t want to be judged and therefore didn’t know he needed help getting back in touch with the Albert of 5-10 years ago. \n\nThe moral here is that when things start to feel heavy, when they start building up and it feels like everything’s crumbling around you, when you feel like you’ll be a burden if you share your story of what’s happening in your life, you’ll feel that emptiness because you’ve lost connection to yourself and others, along with the daily stressors of life. When this happens, this is when you need to reach out and ask for help. Therapy is so important in healing and getting back in touch with your life. \n\nI highly recommend DBT or CBT in both group and individual sessions. It rewires the brain and gives tools on how to handle life circumstances.

                "No-protest zones have been used before. President Bush designated the areas directly around some of his speeches as no-protest zones.\n\nGenerally, when the need for security overrides the need for freedom of speech, a no-protest zone can be established. It has zero backing under the Constitution, and flies contrary to the stated objectives in the Bill of Rights. \n\nBut, government says it can do that, government can do that. That's as simple as it is.\n\nEDIT: That's not to say President Bush's use of no-protest zones is the only precedent for this. He's merely the only one that came to mind. ",
                "There are things known as \"time, place, and manner\" restrictions on free speech. Basically, you can say *what* you want, but not necessarily where, when, and how you want. If I want to give a speech criticizing the Supreme Court, I can. I can't do that at 3 AM with a bullhorn in a quiet neighborhood, though. I can't do that on a military base. I can't do that in the middle of the street with a huge banner that blocks traffic.\n\nBasically, the Supreme Court ruled that a blanket restriction on protests near clinics is not constitutional. However, that doesn't necessarily mean (if my understanding of the ruling is correct) that abortion clinics can't have buffer zones. Let's say a particular clinic suspects that it will be the target of harassment. They can petition the police for protection and ask protesters to get a permit for a space a certain distance away. There won't be a permanent buffer, but there may be one on a temporary basis.\n\nNote that I am not a lawyer, so take none of the above as legal advice.",
                "I know this isn't a particularly satisfying answer... However the law has always put in place special protections for court facilities.  The argument is basically that for anyone to have any rights at all the court has to be able to conduct its business in an orderly manner.  The court also recognizes certain other physical locations where ordinary constitutional protections take second fiddle to national interests (i.e. at the border, airport security checkpoints, and presumably security checkpoints at military bases).  \n\nThere are other special cases as well.  For example if you tell your lawyer you plan on smuggling a weapon into a courthouse the lawyer may have no option but to report that to the police and you might not have any confidentiality protections.",
                "Once again, all the answers here are wrong. \n\nThe First Amendment allows you an absolute right to protest on your own property.  You can protest on government property too, but subject to reasonable restrictions.  Which makes sense - it would be stupid to let people walk into the President's bedroom or in a place with top secret nukes, etc...  The government can restrict speech on its property, but it just has to be fair about it.  For example, the government can ban all protests in an area, but it can't just ban Muslims from protesting but let Christians do it. ",
                "Where are you getting this? I don't think that they found no-protest zones to be unconstitutional in general. They did, however, find that in the case you are probably referring to that the state of Massachusetts did not exhaust less restrictive means of curbing the social ail it was addressing. They did not ban no-protest zones. ",
                "An effective judiciary must be unequivocally independent; as it is the legislative branch of the legal system's task to care make sure law fits the view of the public, while it is the purpose of the courts to resolve disputes that occur around certain aspects of the law. A independent judiciary is essential in protecting individuals from a government's persecution, as their independence means that they execute the law purely by the objective facts presented to them and these details relevance to the law that has been perceived to have been broken.\n\n Part of the judiciary includes a jury, an inconsistent body of easily influenced people, who must come to a verdict solely on the facts. However these sentient decision-makers may be influenced by the media and vocal supporters of a certain decision. Therefore the proximity of these individuals near the jury can have profound effects on the juries logical as well as fact-based thinking - thus it needs to be prevented. \n\nThe need for an independent judiciary was subversively explored in the most important text in western political thought, Aristotle's 'politics'. Then later explicitly discussed in Montesquieu's 'spirit of laws'. The latter called his theory the separation of powers in his book published 40 years before the proclamation of the American constitution. He and this text undoubtedly influenced the American constitution as he was a key facet in the french enlightenment, whose democratic and libertarian values in congruity with their contemporary autocratic government's hatred of Great Britain led to the invaluable support of the French to the Americans in the American civil war.",
                "The short answer is: it's perfectly constitutional to establish a no-protest zone anywhere.\n\nFirst of all, keep in mind that what the Supreme Court says is constitutional is constitutional. We might not always agree with their decisions, but that's how the US government is designed.\n\nThe Supreme Court has historically interpreted freedoms like freedom of speech as \"freedom of speech for all lawful purposes.\" I know you will say \"but that clause isn't in the First Amendment,\" and of course you're right. But you have to interpret the amendment within the context of the whole document.\n\nThe first sentence of the Constitution states that the government's function is to:\n\n >  establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity\n\nThis could therefore be interpreted to mean that the freedom of speech is subject to the government's right to insure domestic tranquility, which would therefore make it legal to prohibit protests that present a clear public danger.",
                "Well, if you think about it, anything that interferes with the members of the Supreme Court getting to their duties would be an obstruction of Justice. ",
                "The Supreme Court's buffer zone may in fact be unconstitutional.  But we'll have to wait for someone to challenge it in court before we know for sure:\n\n_URL_0_",
                "Because the buffer around the courthouse does not reach the public street. its set way, way back from the street. you can still stand on the sidewalk in front of scotus and hand out your bills or whatever. \n\nbut that headline does wright itself \"Supreme court rules against no protest buffer zone from behind it's no protest buffer zone\".

                "If that puzzles you, look up \"constitution-free zone\".",
                "This is the most basic way to think of how the court thinks of free speech: the first amendment is so important to democracy that any limitations on it have to be as narrowly tailored as possible and have to be for a really good reason. Here, the court figured that the buffer wasn't a narrow enough solution to protect clinics and patients, since most of the time they're in no danger. So, they ruled that the societal benefits of free speech for protesters outweighed the clinic's justification to limit it.\nSource: Just graduated with a political science degree, read lots of boring case law",
                "They decide what's constitutional.",
                "Wasn't there a ruling not to long back where the Justices, or maybe it was a different federal court district area, that said the Walmart Protesters had to be off the property of Walmart, and couldn't even be on the side walks but some distance away, like a street away?  I remember the OWS protesters being arrested for being too close to buildings and such.  It just seems that the SC cherry picks when it wants and how it wants to control people.  I hope that the clinics (at least the ones that are left standing) start arresting people for trespassing.  Maybe they need to enact a buffer zone of say 15-16 ft.",

                "How can the Supreme Court declare anything? There are hundreds of replies with more or less the correct answer. \n\nAre you interested in the argument as to *why* the Supreme Court has ruled like this? If so: \n\nIn a word, Neutrality.\n\nThe Supreme Court (the building included) is a symbol. It is a symbol for the justice system. It is a symbol for due process. It is a symbol of the Constitution of the United States. It is also impartial. Its impartiality is so vital to upholding the Constitution that the Supreme Court has decided that there should not be any outside interference with the way it does things. You shouldn't be able to pay off, shout down, intimidate or otherwise influence a Supreme Court Justice. They aren't at the whim of the popular public opinion or anyone else's for that matter, nor should they be. They review cases solemnly and seriously with their own conscience. Presidents are supposed to appoint very wise people who know law and are prepared for one of the most important jobs in the United States and Congress is supposed to vet them. If we want a say in what the Supreme Court does, vote for the offices that pick SCOTUS justices. \n\nBy the way, they also write out why they elect to rule a certain way in grave detail. Try reading an opinion sometime if you want to understand the logic of a decision. ",

The buffer zones that were found unconstitutional only banned one side (i.e. the anti-abortion side) while still allowing people who were for abortion to be supporters to the people going inside. The difference between this and the supreme court buffer zone is that the supreme court's zone is a neutral buffer zone; meaning that no side can protest on any issue. It isn't being discriminatory.

                "Because as long as we have rulers (~governments), \"freedom of speech\" is just an illusion, and will always be restricted whenever it's inconvenient for the rulers.\n\nIn a nutshell, your speech is restricted whenever it presents a threat to someone's (political) power. For example, the North-Korean government restricts speech pretty fucking hard, because they need to exert a lot of pressure on the population to maintain the current situation there. \n\nThe US government restricts speech less, but they're in a different situation. It's important to realize that both are governments, and both represent fundamentally the exact same arrangement: Rulers vs Subjects.\n\n",
                "Simply because they define what is and isn't constitutional and self interest is a thing",
                "Because at the end of the day, not even one of the supreme court justices has to have any accountability for anything. ",
                "They didn't declare a no protest zone unconstitutional, they said that 35 feet was excessive since the abortion clinic didn't show that they had attempted to use more reasonable methods to no avail. The normal buffer zone for abortion clinics (The zone still totally allowed by the way) is 9 feet. 9 feet away from the door allows people to go into the abortion clinic while still allowing the protesters to express their first amendment rights. \n\nThe Boston clinic's 35 foot rule would extend through the walk way across the street and past the sidewalk on the other side of the road. The supreme court found that to be too much restriction of public area.\n\nNow if the Boston clinic could have shown that the 9 ft zone had for some reason failed to successfully protect the people entering, then the courts would have been more receptive to a larger area. \n\nIt's important to remember however, that this in no way renders buffer zones unconstitutional\n\nPerfunctory: None of this constitutes legal advice, it is just a basic analysis of the majority opinion issued in the case"

                "Yes; and sort of. David McCullough does a good job reviewing this incident in his biography *John Adams*, which I recommend reading if you're interested in Adams.  \n\nJohn Adams was emphatically devoted to justice and the law, and would have believed the soldiers deserved a fair trial - this sentiment is borne out in his many, many letters and writings throughout the years, so his stated rationale for defending the soldiers is not hard to believe. It also wasn't his sentiment alone - the whole point of the trials were to be as fair as possible to give the British govt. no cause to retaliate should the soldiers be found guilty.  \n\nAs I recall Adams did indeed suffer a blow to his public esteem when he accepted the appointment (which tore at him, as he was intensely concerned with others' opinion of him), though by the end of the trial he had more than recovered. Basically, people were quite impressed with how well he had done his job, despite having defended British soldiers accused of murder, and the passion and logic with which he argued their case. Adams was actually elected to the state legislature a few months after the trials ended, so clearly he was well-respected after the fact.  \n\nEdit: Realized you asked about opinions of Adams as a Revolutionary, and not explicitly his status as an attorney in MA during the trials. As far as I know, no, he wasn't doubted as a revolutionary due to his defense of the British soldiers. He was generally seen as one of the more passionate supporters of the Revolution, particularly in Congress, and was one of the driving forces behind the movement to formally declare independence from England. Even some of his political enemies (other members of Congress, their names escape me), would sometimes recall that despite a disagreement or other character flaws they saw in him, they found Adams ultimately to be a true patriot."

Louis the German in Bavaria or the eastern part, and Charles the Bald in Aquitaine or the western part. Middle-Francia did not last long however, and was contest by both the East-Franks and the West-Franks. \n\nHowever, the east and west parts lasted longer (a few centuries), but eventually could not resist outside pressure of the Vikings and Magyars. Central control crumbled and regional leaders grew in power. This happend in both the western part as the eastern part, where new dynasties came into power. With the fall of Franks the western part and the eastern part were divided forever and came to be as France and Germany. "

Eventually, and I can't remember exactly why or how, it was set to 432 Hz, and then later, to 440 Hz, which is what we used today. Altering *all* of the frequencies in a scale by the same amount of hertz doesn't really make it sound off-pitch, as they're still the same relative to each other. It just makes the music sound \"shifted down\" or \"shifted up\" by a bit. It's not necessarily even a very perceptible difference, either. If you hear one or the other, by itself, you wouldn't typically have any reference with which to decide whether it was tuned with A at 432 Hz or at 440 Hz.",
                "this article here summarizes the history of pitch standard:  [_URL_0_](_URL_1_)",
                "There seems to be a lot of misconceptions in this thread, so I'll just try to sort out a few of them.\n\n1. No, changing the concert pitch does *not* mean the harmony changes or anything like that. It is a starting point and shift *everything* equally, so all the *ratios* remain the same. It is the ratios between notes that makes up the harmony.\n2. You do not need to have notes be whole Hz. The unit hertz is just cycles per second. Decimals just means it doesn't resolve in a whole number of seconds. This doesn't matter at all, seconds are just a unit of time we choose to use.\n\nNow, the real reason is much more simple. Basically you just want to decide on a concert pitch as a starting point. The thing is, music existed way before things like international standards were wildly used and communication were a lot more difficult compared to now with the internet. So one region picked one frequency while another picked something else. There have been *a lot* of different numbers, not just 432 and 440. Some tuning forks have been found with things like 455.4 Hz.\n\nNow, they are always around the same. This is useful because while instruments can be made as we want them to be and tuned, the human voice is limited. So you look at singers and their vocal range as well as what is useful musically (a bass tone below what humans can hear is obviously useless).\n\nNow, something interesting that happened was when instrumental music became popular. Because especially stringed instruments sounds better when the strings have more tension, musicians started to tune higher and higher in order to \"sound better\" that each other (obviously all within a group of musicians tuned the same to sound in tune with each other). Now, vocals were still used and it actually did start to become a problem for singers.\n\nIn the end the French were the first to try and standardize it with a law of concert pitch being 435 Hz (although it wasn't called concert pitch back then). Several attempts from mainly France and England were made and in the end we got to 440 Hz (which even now some start to change because they think 432 Hz actually sounds better. This scientifically makes no sense, but let's not get into that discussion)."

                "I personally have never heard of any major influence coming from the Sarmatians, but most of what I know about Arthurian legend is from Frazer and I wasn't very concerned with it when I read him. I find it more than a little hard to believe that Sarmatians could have had any significant influence on the cultural development of post-Roman Britain, since the Romans did not bring a particularly large quantity of Sarmatians to the island, and so far as we are aware these were brought over by the Flavian and Antonine emperors prior to the Third Century. After the Third Century there is a notable lack of care regarding Britain, and a massive decline in the number of troops being sent there. The Sarmatians being settled in Britain were of a fairly small number several hundred years before the development of an Arthurian romance. In any case, I'm under the impression that much of that stuff derives from old Indo-European myths and the epic tradition, which may well predate (at least in some form) the arrival of the Indo-Europeans and particularly the Hittites in the Mediterranean world. There are plenty of other places where Sarmatians were present to a significant degree that really didn't pick up that much from them. \n\nBut hell, I'm not really qualified to speak on this subject, so let's let someone else have a go.",
                "Other than the book you mention, which I don't know about but will check into, I have never seen a reference to this in anything I have read on Arthurian literature.  It's true that I don't usually read through the Arthurian journals, so I'm not really an expert in that way, but I've read a good share of academic works on Arthurian lit, and most of the medieval sources as well.  This has never come up in anything I've read. \n\nI can only guess that if it is discussed by academics, it's probably a small, fervent, and largely ignored group.  I'd be interested to be corrected on that though."

In 2015, to understand what they are protesting against, you only have to look at the budget. Essentially, the government is cutting in social services and massively funding projects that aim at creating wealth as quickly as possible by letting corporations exploit our ressources without taxing them properly. Those measures are taken from a short sighted perspective that does not take into account future generations. Now, people against austerity are aware of the economical issues that need to be adressed, but at what cost? Austerity is a measure that many economists have denounced  (I.E Joseph E. Stiglitz, recipient of the nobel prize of economy) because of the dangerous repercussions it can cause. There are other ways to create wealth and to fix the issue more gradually without compromising the values and the future of our nation.\n\nTLDR. Austeriy means sacrificing the future for an instant of economical stabilty",

However, patients aren't numbers in a factory, they're humans. Already doctors and other health professionals only have 3-5 minutes to see you, if you impose higher quotas, what will that number decrease to? Will a 1-2 minute appointment suffice? Also, decreasing funding will limit the number of health professionals that can be employed, further making it impossible to provide adequate healthcare for everyone in the province.\n\nAll I see is that in the future, more errors will be made, all in the name of \"efficiency\" at the expense of human lives.

The story is giving you information about the world, important information to the story or simply give you an image of the everyday life of the character. Then you have the inciting incident, which is the catalyst that will set the story in motion, and finally the main character take the first step into the story.\n\n & #x200B;\n\nAct Two is the Confrontation. The protaganist start to learn about the challenge of the story and encourter the first problems. That's usually where you start to know more about the characters and the big conflicts in the story. Then there is a big moment, sometime it's because something goes horribly wrong. This is when the protagonist goes from passive passenger to active actor in the story. \n\n & #x200B;\n\nAct Three is the resolution. This is where the protagonist engage with the antagonist and you start to see his true power and usually win over the protagonist before the final confrontation where the protagonist need to learn from the past failure to finally win the day and give us a satisfying ending.\n\n & #x200B;\n\nOf course that's just a generalization, but the 3 act structure is just really effective and can be use a different level. You can use it for a really important moment in a story, you can use it for the whole story or use it for 3 differents movie in a bigger story. Take Lord of the Ring for example.\n\n & #x200B;\n\nThe first movie you have the setup. Things are relatively normal in the world, we have the ring, we decide to go destroying the ring, but the group is seperated and each member decide to continue their own part in the journey.\n\nThe second movie you have the Confrontation. Now each of cast are in their own Journey and they start to dicover the true nature of their challenge. Frodo meet Gollum while Aragorn pursuit the Uruk-hai. But then thing go horribly wrong. Helm's Deep is under attack and is about to fall, but is saved at the last minute, while Gollum is creating doubt in the mind of Frodo and leading him into a trap.\n\nThe third movie is the resolution. This is where Frodo really face the true strenght of his antagonist, Gollum show his true face and Frodo need to face his own internal demons carrying the ring, but in the end is able to finish the job. While Aragorn need to face his duty as the King to recruit to Army of the Dead to fight in the final battle against Sauron to allow Frodo to reach the volcanoe. \n\n & #x200B;\n\nBut each movie also had a 3 act structure in them. In the first movie we see the everyday life of the hobbit, then they find the ring and Frodo decide to carry the ring to the council, that's the first act. The second act is where the group face their first obstacle when Frodo get stabbed, before reaching the mid-point when the fellowship of the ring is formed to bring the ring to Mordor. Finally you have the third act, the resolution. Here we face the true nature of the protagonist, they are facing the orc for the first time, but then Gandalf ''die'' the group flees and end up seperated."

Tasmania became a separate, self-governing colony under the name Van Diemen's Land (named after Anthony van Diemen) in 1825. In 1854 the present Constitution of Tasmania was passed and the following year the colony received permission to change its name to [the colony of] Tasmania. In 1901 it became a state through the process of the Federation of Australia.",
                "Federation was an exclusively British agenda. In the latter part of the 19th century there were a few European powers with interests in the region. Northeastern Papua, Nauru and Samoa were under German control, the French had New Caledonia and Vanuatu, Indonesia including West Papua was a Dutch possession, and the Portuguese controlled East Timor. Federation was, in part, an effort to consolidate and strengthen the British colonial presence in the South Pacific. Nevertheless, it took place on an opt-in basis, and was controversial even within and between the colonies of the Australian mainland themselves. British colonies New Zealand and Fiji sent representatives to the Federation Conference and their governments considered the question, but they ultimately opted out.",
                "Yes. In the decade before the turn of the 20th century, there were six Australian colonies - NSW, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland, Tasmania and Western Australia (Western Australia had only become a self-administering colony in 1890). In this period, Britain was encouraging its dominions to amalgamate for more efficient management, and there were constitutional conventions in 1891 and 1897-98, In order to Federate, there needed to be referenda where a significant majority of each state voted in favour of Federation, or that state would not become part of the Federation.\n\nAs a result, there was a series of constitutional referendums between 1898 and 1900 in the six Australian colonies. In each of those, a majority was obtained, and Australia was duly federated. Tasmania had very high levels of desire to become part of Federation; its 1899 vote had 94.4% of voter voting in favour of Federation - so clearly Tasmanian citizens with voting rights were in favour of the benefits of Federation.\n\nYou can see some campaign posters for these referenda (from South Australia) [here](_URL_0_) and [here](_URL_1_).\n\nWestern Australia's presence in the Federation were more contingent, and their presence in the Australian federation is to some extent an accident of history. If there hadn't been a gold rush in the 1890s in Western Australia which brought in a large amount of people from the other colonies (who ended up voting in the 1900 referendum on whether to join), Western Australia would likely not have joined the federation. Previous to the gold rush, Western Australia had done well out of exports to the other colonies (for which the state charged tariffs), and those tariffs were phased out under federation. Further, federal tariffs on agricultural products, once Western Australia had signed up, harmed the predominantly agrarian Western Australian economy in comparison to the more industrialised East.\n\nThe perception that Western Australia was getting a bum rap from the Federal government culminated in a referendum of Western Australian voters in 1933, in which around two-thirds of the Western Australian public voted for secession. This was put to the British parliament, who said it could only lawfully happen with a referendum of all the other states on the matter - which never happened.\n\nSources: \n\n* Stuart McIntyre (2004) *A Concise History Of Australia, 2nd.

There definitely were ads in PC apps but it just never became a mainstay.\n\nWhen smartphones became a thing, two underlying expectations formed in people's minds: one, that it's almost always connected to the internet. Two, that most apps are going to be free, modeled after websites (google and facebook are free, aren't they?). Even if one developer made an app that costs a few bucks, there would be a clone of it in a few days which someone would whip up, which would be free. So this all led to it becoming a breeding ground for adware, and \"freemium\", and all sorts of things.\n\nBut yeah, i'm no expert, but as the different platforms converge (they already are in other spheres! the whole mobile-friendly ui design thing happened), i'm pretty sure it will be more and more \"acceptable\" (by the companies, not by the customers :P) to put ads on PC.

                "Apologies in advance for not providing a complete answer to your question, but one interesting aspect of this is the link to Russo-Qing relations in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Essentially, throughout this period China was very significant for Russia because it was a market for Siberian furs. This is actually pretty unusual, because by and large China is much warmer than Russia and there was no real culture of fur consumption--before the Qing conquest. See, unlike the Chinese, the Manchus came from a place in which fur trapping was a highly significant part of the hunting culture and which was cold enough that wearing furs was seasonally appropriate. As a result, even after the conquest, when essentially all the important Manchus relocated to Peking, there was a fashion for decorative furs which marked you out as a Manchu aristocrat (the most important kind was, I believe, black fox). \nThese furs were bought from the Russians under fairly onerous conditions but in numbers large enough to possibly constitute something like 10-20% of the Russian exchequer when the trade at Kiakhta was active. It is unlikely that all the furs would have been bought by Manchus, since there simply weren't that many of them and most were not very wealthy. I imagine high-ranking Chinese in search of some Manchu swag were among the prime customers.\n\nAlso, maybe this isn't strictly relevant, but I recently came across this great observation in John Bell's [*Travels*](_URL_0_) (1763, describing Peking around 1720):\n\n > The 6th, while walking through the street, I observed an old beggar picking vermin from his tattered cloaths, and putting them into his mouth; a practice, which, it seems, is very common among this class of people. When a Chinese and Tartar [Manchu] are angry at one anohter, the Tartar, in reproach, calls the Chinese louse-eater, and the latter, in return, calls the other fish-skin coat; because the Mantzur Tartars, who live near the river Amoor, subsist by fishing, and, in summer, wear coats made out of the skins of fishes. But this habit is used only in summer; for, in winter, they wear furs."

There is also a [\"proof\" on Wikipedia similar to yours](_URL_1_) for the formula for the Schwarzschild radius. Of course, it is completely wrong.\n\nEscape speed formula in Newtonian gravity\n---\n\nSo let's look at this purported proof. Start with Newtonian gravity. There is some spherically symmetric gravitating mass *M* and a test particle of mass *m*. Calling it a \"test\" particles means that its effect on the mass *M* is negligible. So we should think of *M* as stationary. The test particle is *free*, which means that the only force acting on it is the gravitational force due to *M*.\n\n**Question:** Suppose the test particle has a speed *v* and is a distance *R* from the center of the mass *M*. What is the necessary minimum speed *v* so that the particle has enough energy to escape the gravity of *M*? That is, what minimum speed allows the particle to reach arbitrarily large distances from *M*?\n\n**Answer:** This is a standard exercise in Newtonian gravity. The minimum required speed *v* is called the *escape speed at radius R*. (Note that the unqualified term *escape speed* typically means *escape speed at the surface of M*.) The condition for the particle to be able to just barely escape to infinity is that its total energy is 0. Note that we are implicitly assuming that the gravitational potential is 0 at infinity. This condition gives us the equation\n\n >  0 = (kinetic energy) + (gravitational potential energy) = mv^(2)/2 - GMm/R = 0\n\nSolving for *v* then gives\n\n >  v*_esc_* = √(2GM/R)\n\nGood. All done.\n\nFalse proof of Schwarzschild radius formula\n---\n\nNow let's switch to general relativity.\n\n**Question:** Given that the mass of a black hole is *M*, what is its radius *R*?\n\n**Answer:** *(Note that the following is the common false proof. In the next section, I explain why this proof is false.)* Let's answer this in steps.\n\n(1) The black hole is a spherically symmetric mass *M* of radius *R*. (We mean that the event horizon is at radius *R*.)\n\n(2) The event horizon is the surface past which not even light can escape the black hole.\n\n(3) Therefore, at the event horizon (which is at radius *R*), the escape speed is *c*, the speed of light.\n\n(4) Our formula for escape speed is v*_esc_* = √(2GM/R). Susbtitute v*_esc_* = *c* and solve for *R*. We get *R* = 2GM/c^(2).\n\nConclusion: The Schwarzschild radius is R*_s_* = 2GM/c^(2).\n\n**THIS PROOF IS FALSE EVEN THOUGH THE CONCLUSION IS CORRECT.**\n\nWhy is the proof false?\n---\n\nAlmost every single step of the proof is either ambiguous or plainly 100% wrong. I have actually written about individual steps in other threads. So I will give some brief explanation here. All the gritty details [can be found here](_URL_0_).\n\n(1) Okay. This step is not *wrong*, but there is certainly some ambiguity here. In GR, we have a very important freedom to choose essentially any coordinate system we want. Some quantities are dependent on the coordinate system you choose and others are not. This step of the proof is implicitly assuming we have already chosen our coordinate system to be Schwarzschild coordinates. These coordinates consist of (*t*, *r*, φ, θ). The angular coordinates (φ, θ) are the usual angular coordinates of a sphere. The time coordinate is *t* and the radial coordinate is *r*. The radial coordinate *r* is actually *not* the distance to the center of the mass *M*, although we are usually sloppy and call it a distance anyway. The precise definition of *r* is a bit technical. Details of how *r* is defined are [in the post I linked earlier](_URL_0_) (it is the second bullet point).\n\nFor our purposes here, you can continue to think of *r* as distance to the center if it makes it easier for you. But the fact that *r* is *not* the distance to the center and the fact that we have freedom to choose coordinates should show you that the first step of the false proof is not really correct, at best ambiguous.\n\n(2) This step is fine. That's not the *definition* of the event horizon, but it certainly is a property of the event horizon.\n\n(3) This step is 100% wrong and the primary source of the misconception. First of all, what does escape speed mean in Newtonian gravity? It means the speed a *free* particle needs to escape to infinity. It is emphatically not the speed a particle must acquire to escape to infinity. Why? Well, the free particle (let's say a small rocket) is perfectly able to turn on its engines and *accelerate* away from the central mass *M*. In fact, as long as the thrust provided just barely overcomes the gravitational force, the particle will escape. It could escape to infinity at literally a snail's pace and actually never reach the local escape speed. As long as it continues to accelerate against gravity, it's fine.\n\nSo what does \"escape speed of *c* mean\"? In Newtonian gravity, it just means that a free particle needs a speed of *c* to escape. Let's for the moment suppose that Newtonian physics did not allow speeds greater than *c*. *An escape speed of c would still not mean that escape is impossible.* It would just mean that a free particle could not escape: it would *have* to accelerate to escape. So you can see that characterizing a black hole as an object whose escape speed is *c* is absolutely wrong. Escape from beyond the event horizon is *impossible*, no matter what the particle does, even it turns on its engines. If you were to say that a black hole is an object for which the escape speed is greater than *c*, that does not characterize the black hole because statements like \"escape speed is...\" say nothing about the actual *possibility* of escape for a particle, but only for a free particle.\n\n*Black holes are not objects whose escape speed is c at the event horizon, or objects whose escape speed is  >  c beyond the event horizon.* Black holes are objects defined via their causal structure. Any particle that passes the event horizon has the singularity in its causal future. Period. End of story. That's the definition. No shenanigans about the escape speed, which has either no meaning or an ambiguous meaning in GR anyway. For more details, you may see the post I linked earlier.\n\n(4) Given that step (3) is 100% wrong, it is no surprise that step (4) is wrong. But you should definitely be very suspicious of this step anyway. The step purports that a *Newtonian* formula is still valid in GR. That Newtonian formula uses Newtonian expressions for the kinetic energy and the gravitational potential energy... why should any of that still hold in GR? Hint: it doesn't.\n\nSo how do you derive the formula anyway?\n---\n\nTo properly derive the formula R*_s_* = 2GM/c^(2) you have to use the full machinery of GR. Start with the general form of a metric for a spherically symmetric spacetime (which necessarily uses Schwarzschild coordinates). Then solve for the components of the metric if the spacetime is a vacuum (i.e., the stress-energy tensor vanishes). The metric you end up getting has a single free parameter R*_s_* which *a priori* has no physical interpretation in terms of mass. You can show that there is a coordinate singularity in the metric at r = R*_s_*, and that the causal structure of spacetime changes at that surface. That is, r = R*_s_* is the equation for the event horizon in these coordinates.\n\nSo where does the mass come in? We make the approximation that we are very far away from the central mass. In that case, the metric should reduce to the so-called *weak-gravity* limit, which is written in terms of the Newtonian potential. You set some corresponding quantities equal to each other, and you find that the only reasonable interpretation of R*_s_* is 2GM/c^(2), where *M* is what would be called the mass in Newtonian gravity.\n\nIt's okay if you don't follow much of or any of that. The point you should get is that it is *not* a simple exercise to find the formula R*_s_* = 2GM/c^(2). There is quite a lot of math and physics that goes into it.\n\nYeah, but what about this escape speed thing? Is it *really* just a coincidence?\n---\n\nYes. It is a coincidence that the false proof gives the correct formula for R*_s_*. In fact, we *can* make sense of escape speed in GR if we are very careful. Again, details [are found in this post](_URL_0_). You eventually *do* get down to the formula\n\n >  v*_esc_* = √(2GM/r)\n\n...but the simplicity of the formula and its similarity to its Newtonian counterpart belies the subtleties and complexities in deriving the formula properly. For one, the formula is in terms of Schwarzschild coordinates. In a different coordinate system, the formula would be different. Second, v*_esc_* is *not* the coordinate speed in Schwarzschild coordinates. It is actually the coordinate speed in units of the *local speed of light*. The actual coordinate speed is\n\n >  v*_esc, coord_* = √(2GM/r) \\* √[1 - 2GM/(rc^(2))] = √(2GM/r) \\* √(1 - R*_s_*/r)\n\nand the local speed of light is\n\n >  v*_light_* = c √(1 - R*_s_*/r)\n\nIt takes some thought to figure out how we can finally reduce everything to v*_esc_* √(2GM/R). For details, [see the master post](_URL_0_). There is a lot of math in that post, but I tried to explain the subtleties beforehand in bullet points. If you are not math-inclined, just know that we *can* get a formula to look like v*_esc_* = √(2GM/R) but the derivation is not anywhere close to the simplicity of the Newtonian derivation.",

                "Yep, that's basically it exactly! Most of the planets orbit the sun in nearly the same plane (including the Earth). They all lie on the same plane (commonly called the ecliptic) since the planets were formed from a protoplanetary disc (really dense gas) surrounding the sun back when it was first formed. I believe all the planets except for Pluto lie within about 5 or 6 degrees of the plane, so that's why we see them fall along the same line in the sky. \n\nSo think of all of the planets sitting on the same plane as us, and then you add in the axial tilt of Earth -- like you said -- and suddenly they're all sitting at an angle relative to us. \n\nThere's a nice little description [here](_URL_0_). \n\nEdit: Oops, forgot the Moon. What /u/spartacus311 said.",
                "Yes, the plane of the Solar System is called the [ecliptic](_URL_2_) and it's the path that we see the Sun, Moon, and planets take through our night sky. \n\nThe angle that the ecliptic makes with the celestial equator looks something like [this](_URL_0_) (seen farther down the page). The celestial equator is the extension of the Earth's equator drawn into space, and the celestial poles are the extension of the North and South Poles into space as well. That has to do with the tilt of the Earth, and the angle of the celestial equator has to do with your latitude. The North Celestial Pole (NCP), for example, will be at an altitude equal to your latitude if you're in the northern hemisphere, so at the North Pole, the NCP is straight overhead (altitude = 90 degrees, latitude = 90 degrees). At the equator, the NCP is on the horizon (altitude = 0, latitude = 0). And, for latitude X, the altitude will be X. Since the equator is 90 degrees from the North Pole, the celestial equator is 90 degrees from the NCP, so from straight line geometry, it will have an altitude of 180 - 90 - latitude (or just 90 - latitude), see [this picture](_URL_1_) for the latitude of Milwaukee.\n\nOkay, so where was I going with this. Since the Earth is tilted 23.4 degrees from the ecliptic, the celestial equator will also be tilted by that amount. But, it's altitude as we see it changes throughout the year. You can sort of see that in the first picture, where the Sun is high in the sky for northern summer. If the Sun was on the other side (left) of the diagram, then it would be low in the sky for northern winter. So, for the latitude of Milwaukee (43 degrees), the celestial equator is at 47 degrees, and the ecliptic appears between 23.6 degrees and 70.4 degrees altitude (47+/-23.4). On the equinoxes, the Sun will be on the celestial equator, and since it will follow it over the course of that day, that's why there's 12 hours of day and night (half the great circle).",
                "the best part about this view/picture when you see it, especially if it's right after sunset so you have a sense of the location of the sun to boot....is to then feel/sense earth being on that same plane.   this kind of view is the only time i'm really able to conceive of my place in it meaningfully."

Here to discuss your questions are:\n\n* Dr. Matt Kaeberlein, Professor at the University of Washington Department of Pathology, co-director of the Dog Aging Project\n* Dr. Daniel Promislow, Professor at the University of Washington Departments of Biology and Pathology, co-director of the Dog Aging Project\n* Dr. Kate Creevy, Professor at Texas A & M College of Veterinary Medicine  &  Biomedical Sciences, lead veterinarian for the Dog Aging Project\n* Dr. Silvan Urfer, Senior Fellow at the University of Washington Department of Pathology, veterinary informatics officer for the Dog Aging Project\n\nOur goal is to define the biological and environmental factors that influence healthy aging in dogs at high resolution, and to use this information to improve the quality and quantity of life for our pets.  So far, most scientific research on the biology of aging (geroscience) has been conducted in the lab under standardized conditions. Results from these studies have been quite encouraging (for example, Matt's group has recently managed to extend life expectancy in middle-aged mice by 60%). We believe that the domestic dog is ideally suited to bring this work out of the lab and into the real world.  There are many reasons why dogs are uniquely suited for this effort, including that they share our environment, receive comparable medical care, are affected by many of the same age-related diseases, and have excellent health and life span data available.\n\nWhile aging is not a disease, it is the most important risk factor for a wide range of diseases such as cancer, arthritis, type 2 diabetes, kidney failure and so on. Therefore, by targeting the biological mechanisms of aging, we can expect to see benefits across the spectrum of those otherwise unrelated diseases - which has lead us to state that healthy aging is in fact *The Ultimate Preventive Medicine.*\n\nOur hope is that by understanding the biological and environmental factors that influence the length of time an individual lives in good health (what we call 'healthspan'), we can better understand how to maximize each individual dog's healthspan. Having dogs live and stay healthy for longer will be beneficial for both the dogs and their owners. Moreover, given that dogs live in the same environment as we do, what we learn about healthspan in dogs is likely to apply to humans as well – so understanding healthy aging in dogs might help us to learn how to ensure the highest level of health at old age for humans. \n\nWe welcome interested citizen scientists to sign up their dogs to be considered for [two studies](_URL_0_/project-details/):\n\n* *The Longitudinal Study* will study 10,000 dogs (our 'foundation cohort') of all breeds and ages throughout North America. This intensively studied cohort will be followed through regular owner questionnaires, yearly vet visits including bloodwork, and information about in-home behavior, environmental quality, and more. In a subset of these dogs (our 'precision cohort'), we will also include annual studies of state-of-the-art molecular biology ('epigenome', 'microbiome' and 'metabolome') information. Our goal is to better understand how biology and the environment affect aging and health. Results from this study should help us to better predict and diagnose disease earlier, and so improve our ability to treat and prevent disease. There are no health, size or age requirements for dogs to be eligible to participate in this study.\n* *The Interventional Study* will test the effects of a drug called rapamycin on healthspan and lifespan in dogs. This is a drug that has shown promising effects on aging in a wide variety of species, and based on those results we expect to see a 2 to 5 year increase in healthy lifespan in dogs. We have previously tested rapamycin in a pilot study on healthy dogs for 10 weeks and found improved heart function that was specific to age-related changes, and no significant adverse side effects. For the Interventional Study, we will treat 300 healthy middle-aged dogs with either rapamycin or a placebo for several years and compare health outcomes and mortality between the two groups. To be eligible to participate, dogs will need to be healthy, at least six years of age at the beginning of the study, and weigh at least 18 kg (40 lbs). \n\nThe Dog Aging Project believes in the value of *Open Science*. We will collect an enormous amount of data for this project - enough to keep scores of scientists busy for many years. Other than any personal information about owners, we will make all of our data publicly available so that scientists and veterinarians around the world can make discoveries. We are also dedicated to Citizen Science, and will endeavor to create ways for all dog owners to become a part of the process of scientific discovery as the Dog Aging Project moves forward.\n\nWe'll be on at noon pacific time (3 PM ET, 19 UT), ask us anything!\n\n\n",

                "I've always wondered if the fact that we only tend to breed either show dogs or neglected dogs has led to their short lifespans. My parents have a pet dog that is still chugging along at 15, old for a boxer. But she was spayed from the beginning and I always thought it was unfortunate that her good genes won't be passed on. Is this studied/known? \n\nAlso it seems like her diet has a huge impact. She was getting old, not running anymore, when my parents switched her to a better, grain free food. After that she started to run again, like she was a couple of years younger. Still, again she aged and went deaf, largely blind and stopped running. My parents started feeding her a home cooked mixture of meat, vegetables and oil  thinking it was just a nice treat for an old dog. But her catteracts went away, she stopped peeing in the house as much, and started being much more active again. Has there been unbiased study of different diets? Is there something I should definitely be feeding my 2 year old dog? ",

It wasn't a conscious decision at first to avoid getting him neutered. Then, at 2yo, I called around to vets to get quotes on cost, over $300 which I couldn't afford at the time.

For example do you expect all dogs over a certain age to be put on rapamycin prophylactically? Have there been any contraindications you have identified? Does treatment continue, escalate, or discontinue once patients invariably develop chronic disease (CKD, valvular degeneration)?  Does treatment continue when short term incidental disease is diagnosed (UTI, pancreatitis, etc)?\n\nWhat MOA do you propose causes the desirable effects of rapamycin related to aging?\n\nAre dogs with genetically known high risk for disease included in the study and do you propose rapamycin decreases risk of developing these diseases?

I think it's important to quality of life (QoL) because a frustrated person has less good will towards the cause of their frustration, making them less likely to do the things they need to do to help the dog to be a good dog. Basically, a downward spiral.\n\nIt would also help both trainers and owners to diagnose behavioral issues by indicating that the remedial actions they are taking are insufficient and that there may be more to the problem than they initially surmised when their solutions exceed the time-frames for a given problem.",

                "Follow up question: \n\n*The Rite of Spring* sequence shows the beginnings of earth, evolution, dinosaurs, etc. Was there religious backlash to this segment?",
                "There was no religious backlash, as Walt had them specifically in mind when he made parts of the movie.  \n  \n > He [Walt Disney] had decided that the \"Ave Maria\" sequence should follow \"Bald Mountain,\" partly as an antidote: \"We are portraying good and evil.\" As Walt conceptualized it, the church bells in \"Ave Maria\" would sweep from the speakers at the back of the theater forward, chasing the demons of \"Bald Mountain\" offscreen. It would provide, he thought, exactly the sort of slow, somber note needed to end the film—the sort of grace note he lamented he didn't have at the end of *Snow White*, where he thought he raced too quickly from her sleep to her awakening. He also thought the scene would be commercial. \"There's still a lot of Christians in the world, in spite of Russia and some of the others,\" he had said at a story meeting, \"and it would be a hell of an appealing thing from that angle.\" If it was being shown in a non-Christian country, Walt advised, they would simply snip it off.  \n  \nClearly Walt was interested in a Christian appeal, so it wasn't like there was any ignorance on his end in regards to what he was putting on screen.  \n   \nHowever, the \"Bald Mountain\" sequence did get criticized, but for political reasons rather than religious:  \n  \n > \"The forces of evil are not shown as the exploiters and war makers,\" he [Harry Raymond of the *Daily Worker*] said, \"but as a mythical devil on a mountain top against whom human powers are helpless.\" In short, Walt had abdicated personal and social responsibility for what Raymond[...]called \"theology.\"  \n  \nAnd there's also Dorothy Thompson, a nationally syndicated columnist:  \n  \n > [...]Disney and Stokowski seemed to extol the savagery of nature at the expense of man. [...] In Thompson's eyes, Disney's nature was so overwhelming that man had no choice but to subccumb, and like Raymond, she say this as an abdication of responsibility that she obliquely connected to the Nazi terror in Europe. Along with Disney's other recent work, the film was, she concluded, \"cruel,\" \"brutal and brutalizing,\" and a \"caricature of the Decline of the West.\"  \n  \nUpon release, the film's biggest criticism wasn't the film's irreligious nature, but it's disservice to the classical music. Olin Downes at *The New York Times* said that \"Mr. Disney's noble and highly provocative experiment separated certain lovers of the respective arts rather than united them.\"  \n    \nHowever, audiences seemed to love it, so much so that Walt started working on a sequel almost immediately after it's New York premier. But *Fantasia* worked almost opposite of what he predicted when he said it would be a \"slow money maker, but a big money maker in the long run.\" It did very well in the first few weeks of it's roadshow run, but for the film's total experience, it required the Fantasound system that was designed for the movie, and it was expensive to install and lug around. RKO wanted the film cut because it was too long, and twenty-five minutes were trimmed off the film's original two-hour-five minute runtime, mainly getting rid of or shortening Deems Taylor's introductions before each musical piece. What killed *Fantasia* wasn't the criticism, but that the movie was extremely difficult and time consuming to animate as well as the exorbitant costs to make it. All of Disney's films up to that point had cost the studio a lot of money, and after *Fantasia* the Disney studio was in debt for around $3 million dollars.  \n  \nSource: *Walt Disney: The Triumph of the American Imagination* by Neal Gabler",

So for Hungary to build a wall is directly against EU spirit and ideals, and against EU law, as Hungary's border is no longer merely its own, but the border to the wider EU, meaning it's effectively France's, Germany's, Belgium's, etc. border as well, so Hungary can't just go and do something like that without consulting the EU Parliament.\n\nAnother issue is that Hungary's leader, Victor Orban, is widely disliked by European heads of state for being a right-wing, populist jerk who's been courting the extreme right-wing and fascist organizations and is openly against Western-style liberalism and democracy, so this is the latest in a long line of grievances of the EU against Orban.\n\nHope this helps.",

Serbs will still pass the border with passport, like they do now. Immigrants only crossed Serbian-Hungarian border because it direct, shortest route to EU, with wall in place, they will just switch to Croatia or Romania."

                "Robertson was still alive in 1912, and he was asked to comment on the similarities between his story and the *Titanic*'s sinking. He denied having any prophetic or clairvoyant abilities and said many of the most striking details were the product of his own detailed understanding of the shipping industry - his father was a captain on the Great Lakes, and he himself had been a mariner for 11 years (1877-86) before swallowing the anchor and turning to a writing career. \n\nIt's also important to see the Robertson affair in its broader context. The *Titanic* went down at a time when spiritualism was highly popular and interest – and active research – in psychical research was also at a height. There was actually a significant spate of accounts of supposed \"psychic forewarnings\" of the tragedy, of which Robertson's happens to be the only one remembered today, as Behe's solo book on the subject makes quite clear. People were on the lookout for such accounts and believers in psychical phenomena actively expected them to occur.\n\nThree other points are worth noting. \n\nFirst, Robertson's story was originally titled, simply, \"Futility\". It was reissued under its more familiar title after the *Titanic* disaster by a publisher hoping to capitalise on the similarities between the two tales. \n\nSecond, the list of \"coincidences\", or \"prophecies\" that appear in Robertson's work is cherry-picked. The original story contains plenty of things that never featured in the *Titanic*'s history, such as fights with polar bears.\n\nThird, there is a second example of Robertson's foresight that gets a lot less attention for some reason. In 1914 he published another story, \"The Spectrum,\" which is an account of a surprise Japanese naval attack on an American fleet at anchor in Hawaii, and how that attack leads to a Pacific war between the US and Japan.\n\n**Sources**\n\nDebra Groom, \"The strange tale of an Oswego man who wrote a book predicting a Titanic-like disaster ... 14 years before it happened,\" Syracuse *Post-Standard*, 11 December 2011\n\nMichael Goss and George Behe, \"RMS *Titanic*: the unsinkable,\" in *Lost at Sea: Ghost Ships and Other Mysteries,* Prometheus 1994.\n\nGeorge Behe, *Titanic: Psychic Forewarnings of a Tragedy*, Patrick Stephens, 1987"

The rest of the work was probably written by Ptolemy of Lucca.

Former Surgeon General, Richard Carmona (2002-2006), who resigned his position, was prevented from speaking out on topics like stem cell research, emergency contraceptives, the health of prisoners, mental health, secondhand smoking, and global health issues; he was also directed to include a reference to President Bush 3 times on every page of any speech that he gave and these speeches were vetted by the Department of Health and Human Services. He was prevented from travelling to conferences and also the Special Olympics (because of their association with the Kennedy family) David Stacher, Surgeon General under the Clinton Administration, also suffered interference when reporting on sexuality and public health - partly the result of the Monica Lewinsky scandal.  Likewise, under the Reagan Administration Everett Koop faced attempts to derail his AIDS campaign. Also, as you refer to, Joycelyn Elders, appointed in 1993, was fired by Clinton in 1994 due to the expression of controversial views on drug legalisation, masturbation, and abortion. Most of the above emerged during a 2007 hearing of the Congressional Committee on Oversight and Government Reform at which six former Surgeon Generals spoke; they all reported political interference but Carmona faced the clearest and most explicit directives curtailing his pronouncements. \n\nThe position itself emerged out of that of the Supervising Surgeon of the Marine Hospital System which was created in the early 1870s as a central authority to reform an existing and run-down system of 30-40 federal hospitals for sailors. The US Marine Hospital Service evolved into the US Public Health Service and the position of the Surgeon General, the director of this service, grew in importance with the increase of the Federal Health Bureaucracy during the 20th century. By the 1960s, the Surgeon General, appointed from within the Public Health Service, was responsible for a variety of federal health programmes including the National Institute of Health, the Food and Drug Administration, and the Indian Health Service. In 1964, the profile of the position was notably raised when Luther Terry released the first tobacco report in 1964. \n\nIn 1967, most of these Public Health Service roles were taken away from the Surgeon General and the position became largely ceremonial. When difficulties or controversies arose out of this role, some administrations elected to vacate or leave the post unfilled; under Nixon, there was no Surgeon General from 1972-76. \n\nEverett Koop is commonly credited with creating a new role for the surgeon general as an advocate for public health during the AIDs crisis. Possibly the last serious attempt to resume that role was during the Joycelyn Elders tenure (forced to resign for discussing at a UN conference the potential value of encouraging masturbation to prevent AIDS). The Office does retain the role of promoting public health policy, but it appears to be heavily political constrained in the present.\n\nMike Stobbe, a journalist, has a book about the decline of the office, *Surgeon General's Warning\nHow Politics Crippled the Nation’s Doctor*, and you can listen to an interview with him [here](_URL_0_).\n",

The same is true for a lance or shield, they would only be carried when needed.\n\nIf it was an area where attack was likely, then they would simply carry them (leaning up against the shoulder, or over the shoulder to take the weight off the arms and hands) or have it in easy reach on a saddle. \n\nIf they were carrying a lance and shield into battle however, the sidearm could be stuck through the belt at the back so that it hung horizontally, keeping it out of the way of your legs, it wouldn't interfere with the horse, and it would keep it more secure than the axe rings that are popular on reenactor belts, even though there's not really any historical evidence for them.\n\nEdit: Sorry, didn't read the 'into battle's aspect of the title, so you can ignore the top two and half paragraphs."

                "Broadly speaking, yes, attitudes towards the SS were significantly harsher than those towards the regular army, the Wehrmacht. In many lower level units there was an unwritten (and in at least one instance written) policy that SS troops were simply not to be taken prisoner. However it should be noted using the word 'sympathy' to describe the troops attitude towards the Wehrmacht would be stretching it a little.\n\nThere are two main reasons for the attitude towards the SS:\n\nFirstly well before the events portrayed in the movie the SS had acquired a bad reputation having been implicated in a number of massacres of allied troops and civilians. The massacre of Canadian troops by the 12th SS and the Malmedy massacre during the Battle of Bulge are just two of the better known atrocities.\n\nSecondly as the war entered it's final stage and the allies entered Germany there was widespread anger that the Germans were continuing to fight even when their position was hopeless. Broadly speaking again, it was the SS putting up a significant amount of resistance, with many Wehrmacht troops simply looking for the safest moment to surrender. At this point the SS felt that they were fighting for their lives and did not expect to be taken prisoner.\n\nPrinciple source : *The Guns At Last Light* by Rick Atkinson.

                "I don't know if the OP means just the Western Allies or the USSR as well, but the Soviets did have a special hatred for the SS in particular. German POWs often immediately met accusations of \"Du SS!\". Captured SS were usually shot on the spot.\n\nHowever, the Soviets were in no way \"sympathetic\" to regular soldiers. After the Wehrmacht's atrocities in the East and relentless anti-German propaganda, Soviet attitudes towards all Germans (particularly men) were very harsh. Captured Germans not shot immediately could expect a spell in the Gulag.\n\nThe Wehrmacht knew this, and often fought bitterly so they could surrender to the Americans. For example, Wenck fought a desperate battle to escape a Soviet encirclement and get his men across the Elbe.\n\nSource: Berlin by Antony Beevor"

The provider uses Quality of Service (QoS) mechanisms like traffic policing which basically says allow traffic up to X Mb/s (or Gb/s) and drop the rest. The logical rate you pay for is called the Committed Information Rate (CIR). When you increase your plan the provider modifies the policy on their side where you are connecting. These policies are templates so it's not like they are reinventing the wheel every time someone changes their plan.\n\nThink of it like a window on a sunny day. If you have no blinds you are letting in 100% sunshine up to the physical capacity of the window (basically the size of the window is like the physical capacity of the port on the router). If you add blinds and start to close them, you begin to reduce the amount of sunshine allowed in incrementally until they are fully closed, which would be a very slow plan (like 3 Mb/s, which absolutely does exist). The outside world is oblivious to your limitations, meaning that it does not dial back the amount of light sent just because you have blinds on the window. However, it's not always very sunny so sometimes there is nothing to block as the amount sent is less than the maximum allowed and other times a lot is blocked on a very sunny day. You can never exceed the physical maximum of the window size so if that was not enough, you would need a bigger window (the equivalent of faster cabling, ports, routers, etc. Which is where you get into Cat 6, fiber, etc.) as well as bigger blinds."

It's easy to see why any German war memorials in the country would be some what understated.  \n\n",
                "I'm not sure anyone can give you a definite answer to your question. There are several factors that might account for the difference. \n\nAs you have noted yourself, the Commonwealth graves are administered and maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, which is governed by a board consisting mainly of diplomats and army staff, and is funded by the Commonwealth governments. The German war graves (all over the world, not just in Belgium) are maintained by the Volksbund Deutsche Kriegsgräberfürsorge, which calls itself a humanitarian organisation and gets 70% of its funding through private donations. However, it has an official mandate from the German government and receives 30% of its funding from public moneys, so it's not completely free from political pressure or policy. It has as its motto \"Remembrance and Peace\" and also promotes educational (youth) activities under the slogan \"Reconciliation above the graves”. \n\nAnother factor determining the look and feel of the German war cemeteries in Belgium is the time period in which they were designed. There used to be 128 small German war cemeteries, these were reduced to four large ones: Menen, Hooglede, Langemark and Vladslo, and they look very similar. This happened in the 1950s, at a time when Germany was coming to terms with the fact that it had been the villain in the century's two world wars. It is only natural that the design of the cemeteries would be rather subdued, understated and melancholy. Tyne Cot, on the other hand, was designed right after WWI, by the victorious British Empire.\n\nThirdly, the German war cemeteries in Belgium are the resting place of a defeated invading nation, which can hardly afford to appear all sabre-rattling, whereas Tyne Cot holds the graves of victorious allies, allowing them full scope to spread themselves about and be a bit gung-ho.",
                "When I visited these graves in Belgium, I asked the same questions to the person guiding us. Her response was that there was much less interest from Germans in visiting the graves of WWI than from people from Allied nations. She said that in any attention people in Germany might have paid to WWI was completely overshadowed by WWII, which (understandably) has become the centre of much more focus in Germany. She said that there is no interest in Germany in remembering WWI, and that very few Germans visit the grave sites. \n\n\nNow, this is only anecdotal evidence from a Belgian tour guide, but I do believe that it is an interesting thought, and would be interested to learn more about the remembrance of WWI in Germany. \n\nAs a note, I experienced the same thing as you. The Langemark site was deserted, unlike all the allied cemeteries I visited. \n",
                "To my German eyes the cementary looks perfectly fine, might be that underfunding played a role in it, but we kinda like our cemetaries that way. "

The music invokes a feeling of power and aggression in your mind, and with the right chord progressions probably also has this sort of sense of building up tension before \"releasing\" it in a resolving chord.\n\nEDIT: If you wanna see a great example of how chord progression can invoke these sorts of feelings, check out this video by TwosetViolin that puts a comedic take on the concept of emotions invoked by music:\n\n_URL_0_;\n\nThey illustrate Phillip Glass's weird obsession with going from tonic, to sub-dominant, to dominant degrees, but then returning to the tonic 'early'. It basically is the musical equivalent of blue-balling, never really giving the listener a sense of closure as the music doesn't ever seem to resolve.\n\n^if ^you ^can ^shill ^for ^sacrilegious ^boys ^slowly ^you ^can ^shill ^for ^them ^quickly",

Meanwhile I, the younger sister, grew to love the music because it's just a fuckin great album. So my mother was always convinced that I was pathologically depressed too (to my detriment) but that's not the case at all.\n\nAlso, Nine Inch Nails and Joy Division are bands that, if you listen to the lyrics, you'd think they are depressing; but I find the music makes me really happy. I think in all three cases it's pretty much the same thing going on.",

People who are in a stable, comfortable position will find extreme music uncomfortable or disturbing, while someone who is going through a period of anger, anxiety, or depression will find it soothing. The article explains that extreme music \"provided participants with an outlet to help process their emotions in a healthy manner.\"\n\nThe [Psychology Today article](_URL_0_) cited by u/Fixedentropy explains four reasons why people who are sad listen to sad music. It seems safe to assume, just based on logic and my own experience, that those are the same or very similar reasons for why angry music is calming to someone who is angry, anxious, or depressed.\n\nThose reasons are:\n\n1) Connection. You feel the same thing as the artist did at some point. That makes it seem more normal and manageable.\n\n2) Message. That artist got through it, and went on to succeed, and in fact used it to further their success.\n\n3) High aesthetic value. Music you can relate to gives you a much more appealing distraction from the negatives in real life than music that wouldn't \"ring true\" to you at that time.\n\n4) Memory trigger.

Chords and chord progressions have different tensions and releases which can release different hormones in the body.

                "In the years immediately after World War II, you could roughly generalize by saying that the US and USSR first worked to make bombs as big as they could go, and then focused more on making them very compact. \n\nIn the \"big as they could go\" category, the USA deployed bombs that went as high as 25 megatons, and the USSR set off a bomb that was around 50 megatons but could be scaled up to 100 megatons if they wanted to. A megaton is a million tons of TNT equivalent. The Hiroshima bomb was around 15 kilotons (thousand tons of TNT equivalent) and the Nagasaki bomb was 20 kilotons. \n\n100 megatons isn't any kind of fixed limit. The US looked into the idea of bombs even bigger than that, into the gigaton (thousands of megatons) range. But building a bomb with that much yield means it gets very, very heavy. At their best the US developed bombs that could get 6 kilotons of energy out of every kilogram of bomb weight. So that means that an ideal 100 megaton bomb would weigh something like 17,000 kg, which is pretty heavy but will still fit in a heavy bomber. (The Nagasaki bomb weighed 4,700 kg by comparison. As an aside, the 50 Mt bomb that the Soviets made weighed 27,000 kg, which tells you that it was not a particularly efficient design. The heaviest US bomb ever deployed was 19,000 kg.) But a 1,000 megaton bomb would weigh 170,000 kg — that's too big to put on a plane, too big to put on a missile, so why bother, even if it is technical feasible to make it? (Which it is.)\n\nBut it's not really about maximum size. In the 1960s-1970s the game became about putting clusters of relatively powerful bombs onto the tips of missiles, missiles that could even fit inside submarines. These bombs, which are more like what we rely upon today, are in the range of 100-400 kilotons. So they are \"only\" 10X to 20X more powerful or so than the Nagasaki/Hiroshima bombs. However they are about the size of a trash can and don't weigh too much (by bomb standards — these are still too heavy for a person to lift). These advanced hydrogen bombs are around 1 kiloton per kilogram of weight, which is about the best you can get when you try to make them very light. \n\n[I made this chart not too long ago](_URL_0_) which plots the historical US nuclear arsenal in terms of yields and weights, color coded by date and size-coded by quantity produced. It can give you a bit of a sense of how the bombs developed over time, and why this issue of yield-to-weight is more important than just \"how powerful\" they can be. It's not about making the biggest bomb, it's making the bomb that will best obliterate your target, and that's a more complicated equation. ",

[There has already been work done on this in the field of black/pyrogenic carbon from the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels in the Southeast Asian region](_URL_0_), but those studies are but one of a few in a very young field.

And if we do, how do we facilitate mass-adoption on a global scale, including in developing countries where environmental pollution isn't really the first thing on the agenda?\n\n2.

In a political climate where perhaps the most pressing issues include climate change, abortion (with fetal development a major aspect of that debate), and others, do you think media reporting similar to the above contributes to scientific skepticism?

But that only amounts to eight percent of the total tonnage. As it turns out, of the 79,000 metric tons of plastic in the patch, most of it is abandoned fishing gear—not plastic bottles or packaging drawing headlines today.\n\n >  A comprehensive new study by Slat’s team of scientists, published in Scientific Reports Thursday, concluded that the 79,000 tons was four to 16 times larger than has been previously estimated for the patch. The study also found that fishing nets account for 46 percent of the trash, with the majority of the rest composed of other fishing industry gear, including ropes, oyster spacers, eel traps, crates, and baskets.

They spend it the same way they would spend other government funds, like those raised from taxes.\n\n\nOther forms of international \"trade.\" Might be foreign aid, which is when one government provides the other with needed supplies. Sometimes that's cash, but usually it's food, water, energy, etc. The governments could also sell products to each other. The US for instance sells a lot of weapons to other countries. \n\n\nThe other interpretation I can think of is \"internally trade,\" which refers to businesses working overseas.",

                "On a very basic level, most governments keep large reserves of US dollars, because it's considered THE reserve currency, so if there are large transfers it's a simple debit/credit.\n\nThis doesn't just apply when the government is involved. Many companies also keep USD reserves, so when large purchases between borders are necessary, the exchange is done entirely with greenbacks. This helps to avoid nasty situations where the value of one currency quickly raises/falls in regards to another.\n\nThere's no hard and fast rule governing this though, just convenience. One of the reasons the Euro was proposed was to avoid the need to rely on US dollars between European trading partners.",

                "I wouldn't say they have been pro democracy in the past! Turkey was under very undemocratic military rule until a coup in 1980 ousted them. Part of the reason that Erdogran and the AK party are so divisive is that they are seen by their opposition as trying to undo the democratic reforms that were put in place (new constitution etc) when Military rule was overthrown. \n\nTheir commitment to secularism stems from Ataturk, the founder of the modern Turkish Nation State, an army officer and the first President of Turkey, who led the fight for Turkish independence during the fall of the Ottoman Empire in the 1920s. \n\nThe Turkish Army is a natural opponent of Islamist factions, but historically that's been much more due to the competing centres of power - army versus clerics - than any great concern for democracy. \n\nHaving said that, the current generation of military personnel may have more liberal outlooks than their fathers and grandfathers, especially with closer ties to Europe etc.  ",
                "Long story. \n\nThe Ottoman Empire was extremely powerful for centuries until it wasn't. Gradually, the empire started losing battles against the Europeans and before long it began losing territory. Many people at the time attempted to understand why this had occurred and how the empire could be fixed. In the 18th century, Ottoman diplomatic corp and Ottoman aristocracy began to examine the the results of the enlightenment and the scientific revolution, particularly the printing press and the benefits of having a highly educated upper class.\n\nHowever much was not done. By the 19th century, the empire began losing even more territory, to the point of embarrassment. A young sultan, Mahmud II, decided that enough was enough. The material progress of industrialization had catapulted Europe ahead of the Ottoman Empire even as modernizers within were shut off by reactionaries and clerics. So the Sultan decided to change things.\n\n_URL_12_\n\nFirst, he destroyed the janissaries. These soldiers, originally Christian boys who had been converted to Islam and trained of be Jedi-Ninja warriors of doom in service of the sultan, had become complacent. Moreover they had become kingmakers. Mahmut's father and uncle were both deposed and killed by the janissaries for attempting reform. The sultan ordered the elite Cavalry corps known as the Sipahis to attack the Jannisary barracks. He destroyed the sipahis right afterwards and set up a modern army. Witty and self indulgent British observers decided to call the incident the \"The Auspicious Incident\" and so it is known in history.\n\n_URL_13_ (Mahmud II before Tanzimat, in Ottoman dress)\n\n_URL_4_ (Mahmud II in Western dress, after Tanzimat)\n\nThe sultan got rid of the biggest opposition to radical reform although there were many conservative elements still present. **The sultan declared \"Tanzimat\" in 1839. This is important. Tanzimat means re-organization.** The turban was outlawed and replaced with a fez. Soldiers, bureaucrats and most wealthy and or important people switched to western dress. The sultan declared that all religions and ethnicities were henceforth equal under the law. The empire began a rapid and concentrated effort to modernize. The military began to form into a professional corps modeled on Germany. Hundreds of officers and officials were sent to Europe to learn about their ways. Books began getting translated. Education became compulsory. Even the national anthem was composed based on Western polyphonic style. Think Japan and Meiji Restoration.\n\n_URL_10_  (This became the new national anthem of the Empire)\n_URL_11_  (Anthem of Mahmud's son Sultan Abdulmecid, compare to Mehter Marches: _URL_7_)\n\nA lot of people did not like this one bit. Although the empire was still officially Muslim, the former privileges disappeared. Before Tanzimat, a Christian accused of a crime could be found guilty based on one Muslim's testimony but a Muslim could only be found guilty on 3 or more Christian's testimonies. Many little things. Also, now all religions had to serve in the military, not just Muslims. And the non Muslim tax was abolished.\n\n_URL_1_ (Postcard celebrating the decrees announcing equality, celebrating Tanzimat)\n\nTanzimat continued. But by the reign of AbdulHamid II, both the sultan and others believed that the empire could selectively modernize. This meant keeping an authoritarian Caliph/Sultan while copying the material progress of the west. Many things were reversed.\n\nNonetheless, the military kept losing wars, particularly against Russia. The young officers decided that enough was enough and staged a revolution. They and many liberal politicians and viziers wrote a **constitution in 1876** that guaranteed equal treatment to all religions and ethnicities and is seen as the first step towards secularism in the Middle East. It is also the first constitution in the middle east. The Balkans had been exploding and the young reformers tried to create a new multiethnic and tolerant \"Ottoman\" identity. \n\n > Text of the First Ottoman Constitution of 1876:\n > \n > Public Rights of the Ottomans\n > Personal Liberties\n > Art. 8. All subjects of the empire are called Ottomans, without distinction whatever faith they profess; the status of an Ottoman is acquired and lost according to conditions specified by law.\n\n > Art. 9. Every Ottoman enjoys personal liberty on condition of non interfering with the liberty of others.\n\n > Art. 10. Personal liberty is wholly inviolable. No one can suffer punishment, under any pretext whatsoever, except in cases determined by law, and according to the forms prescribed by it. \n\n > Religion\n\n > Art. 11. Islam is the state religion. But, while maintainig this principle, the state will protect the free exercise of faiths professed in the Empire, and uphold the religious privileges granted to various bodies, on condition of public order and morality not being interfered with.\n\n > The Press\n\n > Art. 12. The press is free, within limits imposed by law.\n\n > Art. 13. Ottomans have the power of forming commercial companies, industrial or agricultural, within limits imposed by law and statute.\n\n > Right of Petition\n\n > Art 14. One or more persons of ottoman nationality have the right of presenting petitions in the proper quarter relating to the breaking of law and regulation, done either to their own or public detriment, and may likewise present in protest signed petitions to the General Ottoman Assembly, complaining of the conduct of state servants and functionaries.\n\n > Education\n\n > Art. 15. Education is free. Every Ottoman can attend public or private instructions on condition of conforming to the law.\n\n > Schools\n\n > Art. 16. All schools are under state supervision. Proper means will be devised for harmonizing and regulating the instruction given to all the Ottomans, but without interfering with the religious education in the various districts.\n\n > Equality before the Law, Public Offices\n\n > Art. 17. All Ottomans are equal in the eyes of the law. They have the same rights, and owe the same duties towards their country, without prejudice to religion.\n\n > Art. 18. Eligibility to public office is conditional on a knowledge of Turkish, which is the official language of the State.\n\n > Art. 19. All Ottomans are admitted to public offices, according to their fitness, merit, and ability.\n > Taxes\n\n > Art. 20. The assessment and distribution of the taxes are to be in proportion to the fortune of each taxpayer, in conformity with the laws and special regulations.\n\n > Property\n\n > Art 21. Property, real and personal, of lawful title, is guaranteed. There can be no dispossession, except on good public cause shown, and subject to the previous payment, according to law of the value of the property in question.\n\n\nIt did not work out. Partly because it was not perfect but partly because reactionaries staged a counter-coup and restored AbdulHamid II. The sultan returned with a vengeance. Anyone suggesting any big change to the system was viewed with distrust and could be imprisoned or exiled. He set up a very effective secret police. The parliamentary monarchy of the constitution was replaced by an absolute monarchy run by select conservative viziers and the sultan. Intellectuals were exiled or killed. A generation of officers grew up reading their books and realizing that the Sultan was an idiot. \n\nNone of this tension disappeared.\n\nBetween 1876 and 1908, the Empire lost even more land and power. The Balkans began imploding and Europeans took North Africa, including Egypt. The empire was still very backwards and unindustrialized. \n\n**In 1908, young officers in the military staged a revolution. They were called the Young Turks.** The sultan tried to kill them but people flood the streets of Istanbul and the sultan had no other choice but to give them power. They realized that the empire needed massive and quick modernization. Unfortunately, the only reason the empire had not been fully divided amongst the Europeans was that they couldn't decide who gets which part. So they then looked for a strong European ally who would protect them while they modernized. They approached everyone. Including Russia, France, Germany, and the UK. All said no except Germany which said maybe. So the empire began modernizing with the help of Germany. A railroad was completed between Baghdad and Berlin. German engineers built the first modern bridges in Istanbul. They built a telegraph network that rivaled France within 2 years and began construction on subways networks. Everything looked good. Even Russia stopped attacking the Ottomans. \n\nUntil a month before WW1 when the Ottomans promised to give Germany the 2 advanced dreadnaughts they had paid for and which were being constructed in Britain. Little did the Germans know that the British had just told the ottomans that they had seized the ships. So the Germans said yes and signed a formal treaty with the Ottomans for the ships the Ottomans knew they could never deliver on.  (Longer explanation on this series of events in the comments below)\n------\nI'm on my ipad. Gonna go on laptop to edit and continue. EDIT: I'm back. Drinking beers on the patio while typing on an ipad was not easy. This is much better..\n-----\n\nLETS CONTINUE\n\nThe Young Turks were a coalition of many groups. Led by Jemal, Enver, and Talaat (all of whom hated each other), they were initially supported by liberals and religious and ethnic minorities. Their organizer was a Jewish businessman from Salonika (Danone, his nephew created Grup Danone in France). The parliament established after the 1908 restoration of the Ottoman Constitution was filled with Jews, Greeks, Armenians, etc. \n\nSo when they got the treaty with Germany about a month before WW1 began, the leadership was very happy. They finally had a strong guarantee that Germany would protect them from other European powers. But then WW1 happened. The wording of the treaty meant that the Ottomans did not have to go to war unless Germany itself was forced to attack Russia based on its defense treaty with the Austrians (in reality, Germany pre-emptively attacked Russia before Russia attacked the Austrians). But the Germans didn't care and forced the Ottomans into war through a false flag attack (flying Ottoman colors) on Russia.\n\nWW1 is a long story as well. Basically the Empire was not prepared and although it put up a good fight in Iraq and Gallipoli, it was decimated by disease, desertion (remember all those Greeks, Armenians and Jews forced to fight for the first time of their 1000+ time in the empire), war-crimes, lack of supplies, etc. \n\nThe empire lost the war. The Allies divided up the entire empire. Treaty of Sevres destroyed the Turkish nation.\n\n\n\nPARTITIONING OF ANATOLIA (Treaty of Sevres): _URL_0_\n\n------\n\nGroups of educated and motivated officers whose jobs were to disband the remnants of the army actually used their power to organize a war of independence. The religious elite in Istanbul had easily given up to the British. The Sheikh Ul-Islam, the greatest authority on Islam in the Empire called the officers \"Servants of satan\" for opposing the British. The villagers and the army didn't like this. They despised the aristocracy and religious elite for giving up and working with the allies. \n\n\nSo Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, who is a direct descendant of the intellectual tradition of Tanzimat and the liberal constitutional reforms, led the army and the Anatolian peasantry against the Greeks, the French, the Armenians, the Italians and actually won against all odds. \n\n\n_URL_14_\n\nAtaturk: _URL_6_\n\n-------\n\nAtaturk realized that the Empire had been on the right path but its conservative elements had always held it back. If it had actually modernized in 1876 and not let the reactionaries take power, it might have been ready for WW1. The war had killed some 40% of all men in the entire country, with massive humiliation and destruction. \n\nSo using his authority as the savior of the country, and with the army (filled with intelligent and reform-minded Ottoman officers!), decided that Turkey (as the new country was called) had to modernize and it had to do it fast. He abolished the caliphate and deposed the sultan. He also destroyed the religious elite which had formerly ruled the country. Many people opposed this and many people were arrested and or killed. Ataturk and Turks generally see this as a necessary. He changed the Ottoman script, which was impossible for peasants and particularly awkward for the Turkish vocabulary and phonology to the Latin script, literacy skyrocketed from less than 10% to 70%. He abolished sexist restrictions and over 50 women were elected to the newly established Grand Turkish National Assembly. \n\n\nSultan Mehmet V Resad (Last Sultan. Leaving to go board a British ship after being kicked out by Ataturk) _URL_2_\n\nThe Ottomans had never gone through the nation-state formation stage that Europeans had (think Louis XIV). SO  Ataturk decided that everyone within the borders of Turkey would be called Turks. His definition of Turk is not ethnic, its national. He himself was blond and blue eyed and his successor was Kurdish. \n\nNOW WHAT!? The people who opposed modernization ever since Tanzimat never dissapeared. They were angry that the Army and Ataturk had destroyed their way of life and former privileges. They saw Ataturk's pragmatic adoption of Western culture as disgusting. In those days, even mosques used Turkish in the call to prayer. Also, no longer could the clerics act as judges. NO longer could a man force his wife to wear a headscarf or take her property. A million things. \n\nAtaturk at Istanbul University\n_URL_3_\n\n\nDecent Wikipedia article on Ataturk's reforms: _URL_8_\n\nIt should be mentioned that many officers opposed the degree of westernization and secularism adopted by Ataturk and they were purged/imprisoned. However, the people and the majority of the army saw Ataturk as the savior of the country so they went along with his reforms. And if they didn't agree with Ataturk they stayed quiet. \n\nA new Republican and secular elite replaced the Ottoman era religious aristocrats. AKP was founded by the intellectual descendant's of this deposed class. \n\nAtaturk realized that attempts at modernization had failed at least 3 times before. He realized that reactionaries would try to restore shari'ah and Islamic rule and that Turkey, because of its history and geopolitical position, would always be endangered by these threats. So he made the state secular and empowered the military with the role of protecting the state from any government that would seek to turn back the clock. \n\nAtaturk's reforms were top-down and many people were pissed about them. \n\nThe god-worship of Ataturk is largely the work of Inonu and CHP. Ataturk's letters show that he hated stuff like that. \n\n------\n\nWalter Cronkite documentary about Ataturk! Very dated but interesting and good nonetheless. \n\n_URL_5_\n\nModern documentary in English. Very detailed. \n\n_URL_9_\n\nRead: A Peace to End All Peace, The Last Fez in the River, Ottoman Constitutionalism\n\n**TL;DR: Military in Turkey is the protector of secularism because its too long to explain and read the above you lazy prick :-)**\n\nEDIT: Wow! Thank you for the Reddit Gold! I tried to make my post a little fun and relaxed so that people wouldn't get bored. I'm doing my thesis on Ottoman Constitutionalism and late Tanzimat Ottoman politics so please feel free to ask any questions! "

The first has an apostrophe which is ASCII and the second is a closing single quote which is not. Not every program is good about how they are encoded especially when files on disk are involved so they can sometimes be messed up.\n\nUTF-8 is a common way to encode higher things as it represents ASCII as ASCII however if you interpret it as extended ASCII with a certain page you turn the three 8 bit numbers that make up how the computer writes the character into three arbitrary characters.\n\nFor extra fun use a system that incorrectly does it in a non repeatable way.

And/or somewhere along the way, someone opened and re-saved the document in a standard format, so those nonstandard proprietary characters got scrambled.\n\nMore recently, standards have been expanded (UTF-8) to include a lot more characters, including those old proprietary characters, so as long as everyone is using the same standard, and all the software is expecting the text in that standard, things should look fine.  But the software often incorrectly assumes that things are or aren't from the older standards, or it just doesn't even do the new standards right, so it tries to convert and the text gets garbled.\n\nNever use word processors (or other major office software) for any important text.  Stick to standard text editors that don't make assumptions or try to fancy it up for you.",
                "The short of it is that some programs like to get fancy when it comes to punctuation marks and other programs are stupid and don't understand all that fancy stuff and get things wrong.\n\nThere are different ways for computer to store text as a series of numbers.\n\nOne that used to be one that most computers used is called ASCII.\n\nIt is basically a lookup table for 128 characters and their corresponding numbers. For example \"A\" is 65 etc. A quarter of those 128 possible numbers gets taken up with stuff that isn't actually a printable character, but things that were used in the days of teleprinters.\n\nThis leaves 96 values for actual letters and stuff. 26 for the letters from \"A\" to \"Z\" and another 26 for \"a\" to \"z\" plus the number digits \"1\" to \"0\".\n\nThis doesn't leave much room left over for other stuff like ' `´\" etc. let alone all the different non-english alphabets that use different characters like \"ö\".\n\nThere were for a while numerous different expansion of that table that assigned different values for different additional characters.\n\nWhen converting from one of these system to another you ended up with garbage for anything but the most basic letters and numbers which are the same in most of these systems.\n\nNowadays we have Unicode which encodes all the characters there ever were and ever will be in a single unified system. Unfortunately some older system may try to read Unicode text as being meant for a different format. Text gets converted improperly and the result is that the letters and numbers are okay but any fancy characters aren't.\n\nThere is a simple \"'\" character in ASCII it has the value 39 and is called an apostrophe. It can be used for a variety of different punctuation marks from single quotes to minutes to any number of things that look like an apostrophe. There is another in one of the extension of ASCII that gets commonly used that looks like \"´\" and is called and \"acute accent\".\n\nWord and other word processors like to get fancy however they don't want to use the simple one size first all characters in basic ASCII, they want special characters for each purpose and use whatever seems the best fit.\n\nFor \"I’m\" a character called \"RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK\" in the unicode docs gets used by programs like Word. The ’ may look like a ´ or ', but it isn't.\n\nWhen the fancy word punctuation mark gets interpreted by a dumb program that things it is ascii  it sees the three bytes used to write it 0xE2 0x80 0x99 and interprets them as three different basic characters in one of the old ASCII extensions instead of the Unicode character it is meant to be.\n\nThe solution is to ensure that you use the right lookup table to understand which characters the numbers are meant to be or if you can't rely on the other program displaying the message getting things right to only use simple characters that can't be misinterpreted. Trying to get fancy only to be misunderstood is not really helping anyone.",
                "Computers store everything as numbers. Letters are not numbers. To fix this, we agreed upon ways to encode letters as numbers. ASCII is one of the most influential examples. Basically, ASCII splits one large number, that is the file, into smaller numbers by groups of 8 binary digits, or bits.\n\nBits sometimes confuse people, so I'll do a switcheroo, I'll use decimal digits instead. Details relating to the numbers won't be right, but you can check actual encodings later. So let's say computers use decimals instead, and store everything as numbers like that. So instead of 8 bits, let's say our imaginary standard splits large numbers into groups of 2 digits. So if a file was 14169455, you'd read that as 14, then 16, then 64, then 55. Simple. So now we'd just check from our encoding what each of these numbers mean. Like, maybe 14 corresponds to letter 'e'?\n\nBut then comes trouble. There are many encodings, mainly because there are more letters than 100 we can write with two decimal digits(256 with 8 bits). Imagine Chinese for example. So lots of places try to make encodings that supports their own characters, and usually they try to make sure latin alphabet matches ASCII so American stuff mostly shows correctly with their encoding. Which puts programs into a tough spot, because many file types do NOT specify encoding used. They just have to guess. And when they guess wrong, you get something like in title.\n\nThis story has a happy ending though. In the end, lots of people went together and made an encoding to encode all the letters and symbols on Earth. It used variable length where some numbers, say, 90 - 99, mean that the next two decimals are actually part of this letter. This meant they could have more than 100 options for what a single letter can be, but for latin alphabet, the system looks like ASCII(14 is still 'e'). All praise utf-8.",
                "Computers only think in 1's and 0's.\n\nWe have created several different ways to translate back and forth between 1's and 0's and other characters, like A-Z and different punctuation marks, called \"encoding methods.\" For example, here is a super simple encoding method that I just made up:\n\n > A = 00000000  \n >   \n > B = 00000001  \n >   \n > C = 00000010  \n >   \n > D = 00000011  \n >   \n > E = 00000100\n\nSome encoding methods only cover very basic characters, like A-Z and basic punctuation marks. In these simple encoding methods, there is no difference between the quotation marks at the start and the end of a word. For instance, both of these quotation marks are the same:\n\n# \"test\"\n\nBut some encoding methods cover a wider array of characters, including different punctuation marks for the left and right quotation marks surrounding a word. For example, if you look closely, you'll see that these two quotation marks are different:\n\n# “test”\n\nMicrosoft programs, including Microsoft word, really like to use fancy punctuation marks, including separate characters for apostrophes, left single-quotes, and right-single quotes. So when you type \"I'm\", it will automatically convert the apostrophe to a fancy one: \"I'm\"\n\nEven though these two characters look the same on most screens, they actually have different values when converted to 1's and 0's:\n\n > Simple apostrophe = 00000011011  \n >   \n > Fancy left single quote = 11111100010\n\nWhen you write a message inside of Microsoft Word, then save it out to a file, all those letters and punctuation marks get converted to their 1's and 0's, like you'd expect. Then, all those 1's and 0's get sent to another computer, or another program, so that they can be converted back into letters and punctuation marks for the other person to read.\n\nIf the other person is using the same program with the same encoding method, then nothing will be lost in translation! However, a LOT of programs don't use the same encoding methods as Microsoft Word, which means one of two things happens: either they don't know what \"11111100010\" stands for, so they display a \"missing character\" symbol (usually an empty box), or even worse, \"11111100010\" might stand for something totally weird and crazy - or maybe even multiple characters, like the \" **â€™**\" you used in your example.\n\n & #x200B;\n\n**EDIT** \\- Barring Rule #4, here's an even simpler explanation:\n\nComputers have their own language, and we've invented lots of different translators to help us talk back and forth with them.\n\nWhen you use two different translators to translate the same message, sometimes you end up with silly errors, like the one mentioned in OP's title.",

They are not actually visible but they are needed to print all in the right position :-)\n\nThis is called ASCII table.\n\nWas ok... But many human languages used characters that weren't in those 95.\n\nFor example in Italy we commonly use accents: `à`, `è`, `é`, `ì`, `ò`, `ù`. German have `ß`. Greece has it's own alphabet, you might have seen it in math classes. Japanese have 3 different alphabets they use interchangeably in the same sentence, and they write from right to left. Arabs, their own alphabet, and so on...\n\nPc were already using 8 bits for each character, just not using the last.\nSo they figured: hey, why don't we add 1 bit, make them 8 bit and use 256 characters (128 more).\n\nExcept everyone had different needs and suddenly the same sequence of 8 bits were interpreted differently by different countries.\n\nMany standard were born, like ISO-8859-1 (Latin 1), ISO-8859-2 (Western Europe), ISO-8859-5 (Cyrillic). Microsoft even created a slightly different version of the Latin 1, just to add to the confusion.\n\nThe only parts common to everyone were those initial 128 characters.\n\nNow, there was an huge problem.. you received a sequence of bits, you know it is text, but you have no idea what is the conversion table you have to use to actually know what to print / draw on the screen.\n\nThen things got e even more complicated...\nFor some language 128 characters are simply not enough, think of the Japanese or Chinese symbols.\nSome others have ligatures between characters like `æ`.\nOther countries don't use `\"`, they use `“` or `”` or even `„`. Same of `'` vs `‘`.\nAnd then there are all those weird things like ©®™.\nAnd the currency symbols $ £ ¥ ¢ €...\n\nYou see... You could start to add more bits and having more and more bits for every characters... But PC go with blocks of 8 bits. So you need to double them.\nBut that means the same text now suddenly takes twice the space, even when it is rarely used...\n\nSo some cleaver guy figured they could use one special character of the 256 to signal the next 16 bit was to read together.\n\nAt that time everyone built it's own standard.\n\nNowadays the defacto standard has been established. It's Unicode and it's binary encoding, called UTF-8. It has all of the characters for every possible need. It can grow adding new stuff as needed, like a couple if years ago the € euro symbol has been added and emojis you use everyday like 😉 are characters of the Unicode standard.\n\nBut there are still program not using it.\n\nThis stuff is difficult for programmers too... And many programmers still ignore the issue.. and so `I’m` is written somewhere using some encoding and it is passed somewhere else that read it with a different encoding, possibly resulting in weird stuff.\n\nOnce you identified the actual characters you still need to know how to draw them, that's what Fonts are for. And mamy fonts do not have all the glyph, which means you can decode all the text correctly but still be unable to show it on the screen."

This was changed by the Western occupying powers in the early 1950s thanks to agitation by veterans organizations. This was helped by the threat of the Eastern Bloc felt by the west in Germany, and pensions were restored to non-SS personnel around the same time as West Germany itself began rearming. However, these pensions would have been relatively modest if anything at all, and most of the men of early 1950s Germany who were former soldiers but found themselves destitute would have re-enlisted in the new Bundswehr.

English has experienced considerable linguistic evolution/change over the last 1500 years, but not in any way a suprising degree of change. All languages changes over time, though not always in the same way and definitely not at the same rate. The factors involved can be complex, and I would ad that English in *recent* years has become so fluid because (a) it is a language with *so many speakers*, and (b) a lot of 2nd language speakers, that small 'change effects' get amplified. \n\nWhat about Arabic? I presume you were taught Modern Standard Arabic, and probably write in MSA, though depending on your context there's a good chance you don't speak how you write.\n\nIn any case, there are all sorts of varieties of 'Arabic', and all of them show linguistic evolution from Classical Arabic (the Arabic of the Qu'ran). Even MSA, which self-consciously models itself on the standards of CA, does not adhere to CA in all aspects.\n\nHere's where and why Arabic is a fairly unique cases - the Qu'ran and Islam function as very powerful 'conservative forces' in regards to language. The Qu'ran doesn't get translated, it gets 'interpreted'. If you are serious about Islam, you learn Arabic to read the Qu'ran. And not just any Arabic, you learn the Arabic of the Qu'ran. So for 1500 years there has been a very, very powerful socio-religious force that instills a particular 'standard of language' in almost all Arabic literary education. That applies to 1st language speakers in schools, and 2nd language speakers. It's why MSA remains consistent across countries too. It's a linguistically 'ideal' language.\n\nAnd, it explains why diglossia is so common for Arabic speakers - one language (= version of Arabic) for the Qu'ran, high level literature, government, politics; another language (= version of Arabic) for everyday life. Both get called 'Arabic', but linguistically speaking local dialects of Arabic can deviate very far from MSA.\n\nArabic, then, is the outlier. While there are other languages with high degrees of linguistic conservatism, there are none that I can think of that have it for the same reasons. Certainly, for English there was never a single \"linguistic ideal\" embodied in an unchanging text that required all religious adherents to learn a single-version of English. *That* linguistic force doesn't hold English together.\n\nLike I said, I do suggest cross-posting. I'm very happy to talk about linguistic change/factors in English/Arabic/other languages some more."

You created a wave of people moving. lets assume you instantly told, everyone they are going to move and you moved them, Because it's infinite you'll never free up enough space (the hotel is occupied at every number you get to) for another infinite amount of people.\n\nI'll explain what this has done another way. Two strings that are infinitely long, one red, one blue. Both wish to occupy the same space. Red string is already in that space, to create room for blue string you create a wave, and feed blue into the now empty space. The red wave will go on infinitely and you will infinitely fill in blue for red. You never finish putting blue string in because it's infinite, and red string is never again \"at rest,\" because it is constantly moving for blue.\n\nI understand it's supposed to be a way to illustrate how large infinity is, but surely there has got to be a better way to explain this.\"\n\n\nEdit: The more answers I get explaining unique ways of understanding this issue I get the more fraking excited I am by the concept.

It seems you're assuming that the process of people in the hotel moving to even numbered rooms never terminates, correct? Why do you not have the same objection when we added just a single person to the hotel? The two scenarios really aren't all that different, instead of picturing that all of the people in the hotel scrambled from room n to room 2n picture instead that the concierge took the 1st person in the bus to the 1st room. We've reduced this to the case of adding one person, except instead of being instructed to move one room over the hotel guests are instructed to double their room number. Great, we've reduced it to a solved problem and we're done with the 1st person in the bus. Next we take the 2nd person in the bus, take them to room 3, and instruct the hotel guests as above. Again, solved problem, we are done. We can continue this way and for every person in the bus we can find them a room in a way that everyone that was already in the hotel has a room, as we intended to do.\n\nThe point isn't to free up enough rooms, because you need to free up infinitely many rooms and infinity is finicky to deal with if you picture it as a number. So the way the problem is handled is you need to find a way that each person is assigned at most 1 room in the hotel, if you can assign them at least 1 room in the hotel you don't need to keep track of whether you've freed up enough room as every guest has a room and your job is done. As you can see the staff in the hotel are work to rule, fucking unions.\n\nOne issue you may be having is you're attributing too much to the physical plausibility of the scenario. This is a cute illustration, but at the end of the day what you're actually dealing with is sizes of sets, in particular you're answering the question \"how do we quantify the size of a set with infinitely many elements\". You can say they're infinitely large but how do we compare them when we have the natural numbers (1,2,3,...) and the integers (...,-1,0,1,2,...), is one bigger than the other? What do we even mean by size?\n\nThe answer interestingly is that there are as many natural numbers as integers, which we get when exploring for a bit what we mean by size of a set, something also known as cardinality.\n\nSuppose we have a set containing 3 letters, {a,b,c}, and a set containing 3 numbers, {1,2,3}, how do we say which is bigger? Well we can count them both up and end up with 3 elements in each, which is great but that isn't going to be of much use in the infinite case. Another way to go about it is we can find a way to assign a unique letter to each number and a unique number to each letter: a corresponds to 1 and vice versa, b < - > 2,c < - > 3. We call that assignment a 'bijection'. We can also figure out when one is bigger than the other by similar means, suppose we compare {a,b,c}, and {1,2,3,4}, we can see the second set is bigger, but why? Well for every letter we can assign a unique number a- > 1, b- > 2, c- > 3, but we have a number (4) that can't be assigned a unique letter. It is useful with infinite sets to do the assignment one way, without checking if the reverse can even work, and say that the second set is *at least as big* as the first.\n\nNow let's go and compare the integers with the natural numbers. Now since the integers contain the natural numbers we see the integers are at least as big as the natural numbers. What we need to show is that the natural numbers are at least as big as the integers, we do this by the assignment process above. That is to say given an integer we need to assign it a natural number and no natural number can be assigned twice. How do we do that?\n\nLet's start with the largest integer that isn't a natural number, 0 (in my definition), and assign it to 1. Now let's put the natural numbers in themselves by taking a natural number and multiplying it by 2, which is the assignment 1- > 2, 2- > 4, 3- > 6,... \n\nWhich natural number would be taken by this process? well 1 is taken and so is the even natural numbers. What's left is 3 and every odd number bigger than it. So we can assign -1 - >  3, -2 - >  5... (the algebraic rule here is whenever k < 0 , assign(k)= 2\\* |k|+1.\n\nSummary: This shows that the integers and the natural numbers are of the same size, a sort of paradox similar to Hilbert's hotel. One thing to note here is that we don't need to make an explicit mention of infinity until the last step. We can make our assignments for finite numbers, prove that the assignment never puts two integers to the same natural number, and then show that the assignment can go over all integers. The lesson from this, and Hilbert's hotel, is that dealing with infinity is usually hard and it can be sensitive, so the approach to take is to somehow reduce it to a problem with finitely sized sets and show that the properties you want carry over in the infinite case.",
                "The nature of infinity is such that adding to it doesn't make it larger. Subtracting from it doesn't make it smaller.\n\nSo (2 *  *denumerable* infinity)= *denumerable* infinity, and  *denumerable* infinity+ *denumerable* infinity= *denumerable* infinity. I think the problem is that you are imagining a fluid situation that isn't fluid. You aren't \"creating\" rooms (as you have stated in your explanation). All the rooms are already there, and they aren't being created, nor being destroyed.\n\nYour example of the string is a problem. You see, we have been talking about  *denumerable* infinity, not  *nondenumerable* infinity, which would more accurately describe the string (a continuum, rather than something compose of individual discrete objects). The same flaw in your conception is present in that analogy. The strings aren't \"moving\". It isn't a fluid situation.",
                "I had the same problem when considering recurring decimals, and how 0.9999... is exactly equal to 1.\n\nFor the rucurring decimals, my problem arose in thinking that, because we are writing down an infinite number of 9s, you will always be at least a little bit away from 1. But this isn't infinity, this as an increasing sequence of finitely many 9s.\n\nInstead, think about it in terms of putting all infinitely many 9s down first, using an infinitely long rubber stamp. Then, you can't find \"the end\" of the number, and thus can't calculate a non 0 difference.\n\n\n\nNow think about your hotel. Instead of starting at the lower numbers and moving everyone along, move everyone at the same time.\n\nLet's say it takes everyone already in the hotel 5 minutes to move from the their original room n, to their new room, 2n, (some people will have to run pretty fast, but because we are not thinking about this physically, this is ok). Then, after 5 minutes, all of your original guests are accommodated for, they all have an even room.\n\n\n\nNow let's empty our bus. Before we start the moving process, give eveyone on the bus a room number based on their coach seat number. Someone sat in seat n, moves into room 2n-1. Everyone on the bus has a room number, all the room numbers are odd, and thus all the newly allocated rooms are empty.\n\nNow, making sure people get a move on, we give everyone 10 minutes to move into their new rooms, which we assume they can do (because we aren't physically doing this). Then after 10 minutes, the hotel is full again, and all our guests have rooms.\n\n\n\nTL;DR, think about moving all your guests simultaneously at every stage, rather then one after the other.",
                "Good to see you thinking about infinity, certainly one of the more interesting parts of mathematics. It's especially fun because, as this video shows, ideas about infinity can be explored without much more than an elementary maths background.\n\nYou say you have an issue with the ideas presented in this video, that's great! In mathematics if you think something is wrong then a really powerful tool to show it is by finding what's called a counterexample, a specific case that doesn't work. Let's deal with the case of fitting that countably infinite bus of people into the hotel. I challenge you to find a counterexample, i.e. a person (from either the bus or already in the hotel) who doesn't find a room. Take the person in seat 1 of the bus, well we put them in room 1 (and she stays there). The person in seat 2, they go into room 3 (and stays there). The person in seat n goes in room 2n+1 (and stays there). Notice everyone from the bus gets put in an odd room?\n\nAnd as for the hotel, well as the video explains person originally in room 1 is now put in room 2 (and stays there). The person in room 2 goes to room 4 (and stays there). The person who was in room n goes to room 2n (and stays there). Now everyone originally in the hotel is now in an even room.\n\nEveryone moves exactly once. Furthermore, the odd/evenness we brought up makes it pretty easy to see no two people get put in the same room. If you're from the bus you're in an odd room and can't be sharing with an old hotel person. And you can't be sharing with a fellow bus passenger because they weren't sitting in the same seat as you on the bus. This is the same idea of counterexamples as before, namely that we're failing to find one.\n\nAs for your string analogy I don't fully understand your wave idea. A better analogy for how the two pieces of string can be in the same place is to introduce the idea of chopping up the strings. Chop the red string every 1cm and then spread them out so there's a 1cm gap in between each piece. Now lay the blue string next to it and chop it every 1cm as well. Again, spread the pieces out but this time slide them into the gaps you created earlier.\nThe reason I did it this was is because mathematically speaking we're doing the exact same thing as we did to the hotel guests.\nNotice how every 1cm piece of string is only moved once, just like how every guest is only moved once in the hotel example.\n\nHope that helped. I know infinity is hard but keep thinking about it and you'll wrap your head around it in no time. The real hard part is letting go of all the restrictions that we normally see in our day to day lives that come from the inherently finite world we live in. Good luck!\n\nSource: Mathematics grad student\n\nJust realised how long this is:\n\n**TL;DR Have a quick rethink, everyone is actually only moving once**",

If each person can be accounted for by a room number, there is a 1-1 correspondence. Basically, the whole video deals with finding different ways of 1-1 correspondence. Personally, I didn't like when the video said all of the rooms were all full, but rather there are an infinite number of guests there already.",

        "selftext": "The way I understand the roll of water in nuclear reactors is this: \n\nIn reactors that use low-enriched uranium, water acts as both the coolant and the moderator, creating a negative void coefficient. In reactors (namely RBMK reactors) that use natural uranium and light water, water isn't capable enough as a moderator for the core to reach criticality, therefore there needs to be a strong moderator, hence the graphite rods in the RBMK design. The water then acts as the coolant and as a weak neutron absorber, thereby creating a positive void coefficient. \n\nNow, I'm confused about the moderation and absorption capabilities of water, because I would think that water is EITHER a net moderator or a net absorber, meaning that while water both moderates and absorbs neutrons, it does one of those better than the other.\n\nSpecifically in the RBMK design, I'm confused why the increase of voids, therefore a decrease in water density, *increases* reactivity rather than both the moderating and absorption effects of the water decreasing, therefore resulting in a net zero change from the effects of the water specifically, regardless of the presence of graphite. In other words, even with an increase in voids and a decrease in the neutron absorption, I would expect the water to ALSO decrease in moderation, thereby \"balancing out,\" so to speak. I'm especially confused, because it seems like water has more moderating capability than absorption since it's used as a moderator in many LEU reactors, so I might expect moderation from the water to decrease more than the decrease in absorption, therefore an overall decrease in core reactivity (so I guess that'd be a negative void coefficient in this case?)\n\nSo, even if it's used as an absorber in the RBMK reactors, the water has to also have a moderating effect as well, albeit much weaker than the graphite, right?\n\nAs a quick aside, I've also used the [neutron scatter/capture chart on this page](_URL_0_), and don't know how to compare the values of scattering versus capturing, i.e. whether an element is more likely to scatter than capture or vice versa.",

If you only need this surplus from water to sustain the reaction, it means less water (e.g. from bubbles) means both values go down simultaneously - fewer neutrons, reaction slows or stops.\n\nIf you add a not absorbing moderator like graphite to the equation, this may change: Graphite moderates a certain percentage of neutrons. Water again moderates a certain percentage of neutrons, and it absorbs a certain percentage of neutrons. But now it also absorbs neutrons moderated by the graphite. If you sum this up, the water absorbs more than it moderates, less water means more moderated neutrons left, the reaction speeds up.",
                "The moderation in a reactor is kindof done \"all the way\", the neutrons bounce around inside the moderating material until they stop moving at all (or rather, the only motion is from thermal energy, same as all the other molecules in the reactor). If the graphite is enough to thermalize them, then adding water can't slow them down any more, because they had already stopped. So adding water will not have any effect on moderation, while it will change the number of neutrons lost by absorption.\n\nI think it's not so much that \"water isn't capable enough as a moderator for the core to reach criticality\", it's that it's too absorbing. In order to completely thermalize, the neutrons just need to pass through a few tens of centimeters of water, and any water-moderated reactor will contain more water than that. So only the first decimeters of water matters for moderation, and after that, the neutron speed does not change. On the other hand, traveling through more water will always increase the risk that a neutron was absorbed. This means that in a water-moderated reactor, you can't create a critical mass by just making the reactor bigger and adding more uranium, because too many neutrons would be absorbed by water when traveling from one side of the reactor to the other. So instead, such reactors need to use more highly enriched uranium, so that it can be packed tighter together.",

                "Well its a bit of an open question.  The Norse didn't exactly write down their coronation process during their pre-Christian time and again after their conversion so we can get a nice comparison on each side of the conversion process.  There are Icelandic sagas that deal with coronation and succession, but they were written centuries after conversion and in Iceland which was not incorporated into a kingdom until the 13th century.  There is other literary evidence that is more reliable, especially when dealing with later Norse figures than the earliest legendary kings.  It is further complicated by the largely unreliable nature of genealogy in this time frame, Harald Hardrade for example was claimed in the sagas as a descendant of the first king of Norway, but this claim is hardly accepted at face value.  \n\nHowever lets run through an example from the Icelandic sagas to start with.  The Saga of Haakon the Good does portray succession as a relatively straightforward process of succession by a son to his father, even if he has to see off a few rival claimants.  However his succession is complicated by his Christian faith and the continued heathen ways of his would be subjects.  As a part of his coronation he must eat sacrificed horse meat, but refuses to do so.  There is an attempt at a compromise by eating it through a cloth, but no one is happy with this is and eventually he is forced to renounce his faith.  As I mentioned above though there are issues with taking the sagas as historical sources, especially in the case of Haakon the Good who may or may not have actually existed. \n\nSo in the absence of reliable written accounts we're left with archaeology and that is ultimately a rather limited field to explore rituals that wouldn't leave a great deal of evidence in the ground.  \n\nAny effort to construct a structured and typical succession topos through purely archaeological evidence is likely doomed to failure.  There simply isn't enough evidence to give us a clear and firm picture of what succession entailed in Norse society, before conversion, I'm not sure about the later medieval kingdoms.  Now there is some evidence in archaeology that hints at certain aspects of succession issues.  For example, in Denmark upon Harald Bluetooth's ascension to kingship in Denmark there seems to have been an early attempt at establish his legitimacy through deliberately archaic forms of burial for his father, though he did dig dear old dad out of his tomb and plop him in a Church following his own conversion.  Whether this was a part of his succession or a separate attempt to legitimize his rule is also a bit of an open question.  \n\nOne issue that is made rather clear in the surviving accounts is that succession was a difficult process and a simple transfer from father to son, or horizontal transfer from brother to brother, was not a straightforwards process and perhaps not even the rule.  Norway in particular is quite replete with wars over succession, often with Danish involvement, and it seems rather clear that there was certainly no clear primogeniture practice that is commonly associated with the middle ages.  Indeed Harald Hardrade was forced from Norway following a failed attempt to claim the throne with his brother from Cnut the Great.  \n\nSo the tl;dr, there really wasn't an established mode of succession in the Norse world, despite later literary attempts to show one.  While brothers and children of kings might have had a leg up in claiming the throne, their claim was not inherently respected and inviolable.  "

                "There are certainly events where one has to make a deliberate effort not to judge with hindsight. The best example was given to me by a professor in a class on Weimar Germany: German history in the 1920s was not, and should not be seen or written as, 'Waiting for Hitler'. There is certainly a tendency to see history as the only way things could possibly have played out (not that Alternate History doesn't have its own set of massive problems), and that thus every event is clearly visible by the events coming before it. That in turn means that any of those preceding events is then judged in how it affected that later event, which, in my opinion, greatly distorts historical research.",
                "For me, at least, there are two guiding emotions that come to bear: empathy and humility.  Empathy prevents that feeling of superiority that can easily tempt modern historians as they look back, particularly at premodern societies (the Middle Ages in my case) whose world views and belief systems have many features that could easily strike us as ignorant, silly, or bizarre.  It helps to build empathy by applying some humility, by asking yourself before you leap to judgment, “How will people 500 years from now judge us?” For it is absolutely a given that things we think we know for sure and things we do with confidence in their uprightness will--to unsympathetic people in the future--look stupid and appalling.  This doesn’t mean we can’t be disgusted with or mourn the awful things that past people have done, but it does mean that we have to do our best to understand the individual and cultural contexts within which decisions and events occurred.  \n\nThe most important thing to keep in mind is that people in the past were *really* people, fully human, who were as complicated and contradictory as we are, and that their lives were just as rich and just as filled with the full range of human emotions (no matter how they were channeled) as ours.  When we stereotype them, we diminish them and we falsify history, both of which are immoral.\n\nEDIT: Typos, as usual."

                "No. Unlike what the other poster said, though, it's not because of bacteria between boilings or (usually) toxins produced by them. Bacteria between boilings would simply be killed with the next round and with most bacteria we encounter, it's an infection of the live bacteria in our bodies, not the toxins they produce, that cause illness. \n\nThe problem is that your refrigerator isn't a sterile environment. Bacteria simply don't grow as quickly in there because it's cold. You might as well put the soup outside on a cold winter day. There are bacteria floating everywhere in the air and on every surface in your fridge. These will contaminate the soup. \n\nIf you could sterilize the soup and put it into a sterile container and store it under a nitrogen atmosphere it would remain sterile. This is how most packaged foods with a long expiration date are preserved. ",
                "Wouldn't boiling something that often just dry it out eventually?",
                "Wow... Ok. So it appears I must post about food again. The amount of false \"knowledge\" in these threads has really lead me to believe in my job security.\n\nFirst off, you need a little background into WHY you get sick when you eat food. There are basically two main types of Food Poisoning: Food Infection vs Food Intoxication. \n\nFood INFECTION: You eat something that has a bacterial count that is above the infection dose. This means that you eat enough of something that has a bacteria in it to get you sick. The bacteria takes up inside of your body, it starts to colonize and grow and makes you sick!\n\nFood INTOXIFICATION: The bacteria has been growing in that food long enough for it to break down the \"food parts\" into its by-products (aka it eats the stuff you would, \"poops\" and leaves behind its \"poop\". This could be general metabolic byproducts or toxins whatever!\"\n\nNow. To answer YOUR question. It is actually VERY complex and a lot of hypothesis, but here is a few things.\n\n1.) Boiling the soup causes changes to the food as well. This will, over time, make the food undesirable to eat (even if its safe to eat).\n2.) Rancidity - this is generally recognized as oxidation in the food (oxygen attacking the food and causing off flavors).\n3.) Light - ever wonder why meats and butcher shops are always very bright? Well light is a HUGE factor in keeping certain foods desirable. Whether its keeping its color, preventing rancidity or whatever!\n\nNow. To the BACTERIAL reasons:\n1.) Contrary to popular belief, after a 10 minute boil, nearly no BACTERIA will survive this (at least not the every day stuff you see. Thermophiles are bacteria that NEED hot temperatures to survive. Odds are there isn't much of this in your soup). So, you may be sterile DURING the boil, but as soon as the air hits it at a temperature that wont kill whatever bacteria is floating in the air, it will land and start growing again. \n2.) Refrigeration SLOWS growth, not stops it.\n3.) Over time, the byproducts would eventually reach a critical point that COULD make you sick; (see intoxication vs infection). \n\nThe biggest thing factor in the survival of the bacteria at this point would be a phenomena known as \"Heat Shock Proteins\" or HSP. Basically, this phenomena has shown evidence that if bacteria survive the sterilization process, they have been create a distress protein known as HSP. This protein allows the new generations of bacteria to become more heat resistant. Each bacteria on this is different, and not all are capable of creating a HUGE resistance, but some.\n\nSO with all this, there are MANY factors that would make the food \"go bad\" depending on what you classify as \"going bad\".\n\nTL;DR: There are many things that make food go bad. Bacteria, rancidity, oxidation and light are all factors. The food may still be \"safe to eat\" but taste horrible. Don't do this. "

                "This is not a question that can be answered with a date, it's a socio-demographical question that pretty much needs to be boxed out into locations, subcultures, and time frames with attention paid to the numbers and social classes of the groups in each category.    \n   \nWith reference to Eastern attitudes and trends, the two part 2010 series [*Slumming It*](_URL_0_) looks at the seriously multi-generational Dharavi slum region of Mumbai and contrasts the conditions of living (horrorshow health and safety issues) with the experience of living (unaccountably cheerful and community orientated with near zero crime rates) and compares that with the pro Western attitudes in upscale Mumbai and questions the plans to level Dharavi and replace it with the kinds of shoddy tower estates that were tried and died in post War England and Europe.     \n   \nIn my opinion it's a phenomena that's tightly coupled in Western societies to the availability of the car and personal transport, but I am not a sociologist and the world has a *huge* population - the bulk of the near 10 billion around today aren't western and don't have a car.",
                "I believe that we have a short memory. We act as if it has always been that one nuclear family lives in one home the way we act like every child of decent means should go to college and every person should have healthcare. Before WWII I don't really think any of those conceptions existed for the masses, or if they did they were dreams more than realities. In all likelihood, the rise of suburbia and housing developments like Levittown in NY state were the true beginning of the bi-generational household. I must also make the disclaimer that I'm not a historian and this is of course speculation, but from somewhat extensive reading on the subject this is what I have taken away. It has been a gradual change starting around the time you proposed.",
                "As other posters have noted, the answer varies depending on social situation, availability of transport, and some other factors. In general, most answers (e.g. By Talcott Parsons, the sociologist) place this transformation (concerning western european countries) in the industrial revolution, where massive changes took place concerning where one worked (e.g. no longer on the family farm but in more specialized and/or production jobs that were further away; enabled by better transportation over longer distances, thus less need for close kinship bonds). \n\nHowever, subsequent criticism has at the very least shown this to be a simplistic answer, if not untrue, depending on the value you place on certain authors. I couldn't find a good summary of these critiques, but [this](_URL_0_) will do for now. As, according to this explanation, the industrial revolution was, up to a point, a more western phenomenon, this family structure was as well. \n\nConcerning Asia: I'm not so sure about China, but the Japanese concept of 'ie' (traditional extended household, more common up to ww2, but not so much in current Japanese society, although a father often still has an interesting position within the family) might be interesting to read about. Read the wikipedia page on it at the very least. I believe Korea had something similar, but I have no sources to back this up.\n\nedit: forgot to insert link.",
                "Note that people often don't value cost effectiveness and efficiency if they have lots of money and resources available.  This certainly describes postwar America.  Why should you live with your annoying mother-in-law in a somewhat cramped house if you can afford to move out into a shiny new built home thanks to your new job giving you more money than you know what to do with?",
                "Up until around the beginning of the last century, not only did people live in small spaces with large families (I'm talking about in places like New York) they also would take on boarders. Anything for a penny. Many times these boarders were people from their home countries who needed a place to stay. Pay was just too low to make nuclear family living possible, in general. These places were way overcrowded, with people sleeping on any surface. \n\nThen came the reformers. Also, there were midnight raids on houses like these. It was seen by some as a real problem. Over time, it became less common to pack your place with people. Even boarding pretty much fell away. Cutting off another way housewives could make a living. \n\nPersonally, I think we are going to head back into multigenerational living as wages continue to fall or stagnate and cost of living continues to rise. As mentioned upthread, it has already started with children staying longer nd longer in the home."

                "This is tricky to answer. In all probability, life would still exist on Earth. The tricky part would be the effect that a change in gravitation would have on the Earth. If we assume that the relative mass of the Earth remains the same, then we have two effects present. 1.) Increasing the volume (size) would mean a lesser gravitational effect. 2.) Decreasing the volume would mean that gravitation would be greater. Mass and radius (namely, the density) are proportional to the strength of gravity exhibited by a body. (In this case, the Earth.)\n\nIf we look at this very broadly (VERY broadly), we could postulate that a decrease in gravity would translate into larger lifeforms in general, and vice versa. (Other things such as oxygen abundance also play a factor in this, but for now, we'll just consider gravity). This is because gravity plays a role in things such as the circulatory system and bone density. It's a source of resistance to which lifeforms must adapt. (Think about why you get light-headed if you're upside-down or why astronauts lose bone mass while in space.) Reducing this resistance means that you can permit for larger creatures that don't need proportionately stronger parts in comparison to a 1G force (there will still be a size limit mind you). As a whole, the creatures in less gravity are likely to be less dense. I guess a way to think about this could also be \"The same amount of stuff, just in a larger area.\" This is speculation, mind you. For something more concrete, it would have to be observed. (evolutionarily, life has developed in relation to the conditions on Earth, making this difficult to observe if we would like to see it.)\n\nThe relative oxygen present would also be a determining factor as to how life would be affected. Oxygen abundance plays a role in both size and survivability. I'm not really going to comment on this, however, as I don't know much about oxygen abundance and its relationship to the presence of lifeforms, aside from a direct correlation between the two. There would likely be an impact on plant life, mind you. The more life-sustaining material that you have, the more easily you can produce larger creatures. Since plants produce oxygen (our main producers actually), any effect present on the plants will be proportional to animal consumer life.\n\nTo others: I'm aware that insect size is limited by the respiratory system due to oxygen supply. I wanted to comment on the gravitational aspect."

                "Various anecdotes surrounding the M1 Garand \"ping\" noise have existed since the Second World War, and have cemented themselves in popular culture. It seems to be one of those things (along with many others, such as the \"every German gun an 88,\" and \"every German tank a Tiger\") that someone's uncle, grandfather, or friend of an acquaintance has heard of from an unnamed source or claims to have experienced years after the fact, but few, if any, verifiable instances can be found. In short, battlefield noise and distractions would make the \"ping\" extremely difficult to hear for the enemy at normal engagement ranges, and, short of every American simultaneously running out of ammunition, any enemy attempting to take advantage of it would be quickly spotted and shot down. In 2004, during a trip to Bastogne, Belgium, U.S. Army Chief Warrant Officer 5 Charles D. Petrie spoke with several German World War II veterans who had fought against the Americans in the vicinity, and asked them about the distinctive noise. His account was printed in the April 2012 edition of *American Rifleman* magazine as a comment in response to another reader's comment from the February 2012 issue about a Garand \"question and answer\" article from the November 2011 issue that featured editor and internationally-recognized small arms historian and collector Bruce N. Canfield; \n\n >  The \"Question  &  Answer\" on \"The M1's 'Deadly Defect?'\" (November 2011, p. 42) reminded me of a conversation I had with my dad regarding the M1 Garand and its clip during World War II....His name is Robert Emary, and he served in I Company, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division. When the war ended, he was a technical sergeant and first sergeant for the company. He was a replacement and fought from Market Garden to Berchtesgaden. \n\n >  According to him, at Bastogne it was very common practice to bait the Germans by squeezing and releasing an empty clip to get the \"ping,\" and a lot of times an enemy would stand up, and that was the end of them. Initially, the Germans always seemed to know the exact time to expose themselves to put accurate fire on someone who had just emptied their Garand. He and his comrades knew the Germans could hear the clips coming out and also figured they were counting rounds. This happened pretty regularly at Bastogne, he said, because there were a lot of close-range engagements in the woods and dug in positions. Also, he always carried a couple empty clips in his field jacket pocket and would simply squeeze the clip, let it slide out of his fingers, hit the ground and be ready to shoot. After they started doing this, the Germans got a lot more cautious. \n\n >  He also told me some of the other tactics they used. When they were badly outnumbered, which was almost all the time, the Browning Automatic Rifleman would initially never fire other than a couple semi-automatic rounds. They were baiting the Germans and trying to get a number of them to get bold and expose themselves. When this happened the BAR man would let them have it. He said this was very effective and several times got them out of some bad situations.\n\n >  Dave Emary, Nebraska\n\n >  I found the above recollections to be most interesting, and they correspond with similar reports regarding the M1 rifle during World War II....The point of the recent \"Q & A\" was to refute the widespread myth that the pinging noise...cost the lives of many American soldiers during the war. In the majority of cases, the ping could not be heard even a few dozen yards away over the din on a typical battlefield. There were certainly isolated exceptions when an enemy may have been able to hear the noise. Even in close-quarter combat--when the ping may have been audible--the American with the empty Garand would usually just keep his head down for the few seconds it took to reload using a fresh eight-round clip. Rather than being a \"deadly defect,\" Emary's experiences suggest that, in isolated instances, it could actually be an advantage. While the M1 rifle can be justly criticized for several reasons, to maintain that the ping of an ejected clip resulted in the wholesale deaths of American soldiers simply wasn't the case. \n\n >  Bruce N. Canfield, Field Editor\n\nPetrie's response was,\n\n >  I read with interest Dave Emary's recounting of his father's experiences, \"The M1's Tactical Advantage?\" (February 2012, p. 22) with the Garand and its so-called \"deadly defect.\" While I do not discount the veracity of the senior Emary's account, nor those of other vets who have made similar observations in the past, I do think Field Editor Bruce N. Canfield correctly observed that it was actually a very rare thing for the \"ping\" to be heard in combat, and unlikely to be a factor in most individual engagements....\n\n >  I had an opportunity to travel to Bastogne in 2004 with several well-known veterans of Band of Brothers fame, and while overlooking Foy...I could not help but notice a number of older gentlemen on a path at the edge of the forest who were watching our activities, but maintaining a respectful distance. When I approached them after a few minutes, I was surprised to discover that they were members of German units that had fought in and around Bastogne--to include the company commander of troops in direct opposition to Easy Company. I spoke at length with these gentlemen....I asked each one of them about this matter of the Garand and its distinctive \"ping.\" Who would know better than the men who actually faced it in combat, right?\n\n >  The reality is that every *Alte Kämpfer* with whom I spoke found it laughable. Not only was the ping totally inaudible during engagements, they said, but even in the dead of night, the ruses of cycling a bolt or clearing a clip were well-known to both sides. Sure, an en-bloc clip clearing the breech might mean that a G.I. was reloading, but it told them nothing about who else from his squad was likely waiting around the corner....In other words, while the \"deadly defect\" has become a popular part of the M1's lore (and makes for a great story), it seems to be a uniquely American construct, with little-to-no validation from the *Wehrmacht* troops who actually faced them in combat--not from those that lived to tell about it, anyway\n\n >  CW5 Charles D. Petrie, U.S. Army,\n\n >  North Carolina\n\nCanfield has called the various stories surrounding the M1 Garand \"ping\" one of the firearms \"...subjects that are so silly as to not be worthy of serious discussion. It is clear that the “deadly ping sound” of the M1 Garand is in the latter category. It is firmly ensconced as one of the bulwarks in the pantheon of U.S. martial arms absurd myths...\" \n\n >  This alleged defect of the M1 rifle apparently began making the rounds soon after the rifle's introduction into service in 1936. Despite the ubiquitous claim that has been around for more than 70 years, there has not been one documented instance of an American serviceman being killed (or wounded) because of the noise of an ejected M1 clip. When asked to produce evidence that this actually happened, some vague answer is usually given that somebody, somewhere, knew someone who somehow had been killed because of a noisy M1 clip. This urban legend will probably be around for another 70 years. While there may be legitimate reasons to criticize the M1 rifle, the sound of its ejected clip being some sort of \"deadly defect\" is not among them.\n\nDuring the Korean War, 636 enlisted American soldiers who had seen combat for an average of 6.7 months were surveyed by the U.S. Army's Operations Research Office (a contracted civilian-run institution at Johns Hopkins University) about clothing, equipment and weapons. A series of questions was asked relating to the mechanical operation of the M1 rifle;\n\nQuestion|Men Reporting, No.\n:--|:--\n1.) Is the safety noisy enough to be a source of serious difficulty|Yes - 213\n\"|No - 217\n2.) Is the sound of the clip being ejected of possible help to the enemy or is it helpful to you as an indication of when to reload, or is it of no importance|Helpful to the enemy - 85\n\"|Helpful to know when to reload, therefore retain - 187\n\"|Of no importance - 43\n3.) Is the M-1 rifle difficult to load in the winter|Yes - 117\n\nConclusions reached by the surveyors about the M1 rifle were;\n\n >  The M-1 Rifle\n\n >  ...\n\n >  9.) The noise caused by releasing the safety on the M-1 was loud enough to alert the enemy in some situations.\n\n >  10.) The noise caused by ejection of the empty clip from the M-1, despite the fact at close range it could be heard by the enemy, was considered valuable by the riflemen as a signal to reload.\n\n....\n\n >  One other complaint about the M1 was the noise made by the safety. Half the men had a nagging fear that some day the noise made in releasing the safety would reveal their positions to the enemy, yet only one-fourth objected to the distinctive noise the empty clip made when ejected. They were quite willing to retain the noise of the clip even though the enemy might be able to use it to advantage, because they found it a very useful signal to reload.\n\n**Sources:**\n\nCanfield, Bruce N. \"The M1's \"Deadly Defect?\"\" *American Rifleman*, November 2011.\n\nDonovan, G.

If it weren't, there would be constant 1000mph winds at the equator.  So a helicopter that hovers in the air is pulled along with the surrounding air, and (ignoring wind) maintains its position relative to the ground.  In order to be \"stationary\" in the way that you describe, the helicopter would have to fly west at hundreds of miles per hour against the atmosphere.",
                " > can helicopters which remain stationary in air be able to traverse the whole earth in 24 hours?\n\nTo remain 'stationary' as you mean it, you'd have to counteract your inertia. You and the ground are traveling at the same speed in the same direction, so when you jump, you move above the ground as it moves below you. You'd have to fly in the opposite direction the Earth is rotating to have it 'pass beneath you'. Now, as you've noticed, the Earth rotates in 24 hours. It's also about 25,000 miles around the Earth, so at the equator, that means that it rotates a bit over 1000 miles per hour.\n\nSo to 'hold still' you'd have to fly about 1000 miles per hour west, which would be pretty darn taxing for a helicopter.\n\nIn short, just because you aren't touching the ground doesn't mean you instantly lose all the motion the Earth has imparted to you.",
                "As many people have pointed out already, you are moving with the surface of the planet now and that doesn't stop just because you jump. However your movement is also not faster or slower, but moving further away from the Earth increases the distance traveled in a given rotation. This would tend to make you fall behind very slightly when you jump, although the effect would be minuscule."

I'll eagerly await any answers.",
                "From payment records in the (very) late Middle Ages, when we have them, it seems that a lot of the hiring of spies occurred on an ad hoc basis. When cities and nobles in the Low Countries went to war amongst themselves in the 15th and 16th centuries, for example, it was not uncommon to hire one person or a small group to stake out a particular location for a few days and watch for enemy soldier moving through there. In 1511, for example, a small posse of spies from Haarlem avoided detection on the roads by taking a sled across frozen Lake Haarlem to a watch point on the border with Utrecht. This was a one-time payment. During the Hundred Years' War, too, the English government would hire fishermen to watch for French sea movement.\n\nHowever, city records also reflect the existence of so-called \"secret friends\"--longer-term relationships with a lookout, or perhaps a bureaucrat in another city. That is, they reflect *payments to* these \"secret friends.\" Unfortunately, we don't hear much about how they started spying or what happened to them afterwards--only the occasional tantalizing hint like the payment rendered to the *widow* of Hendrik Faes (also in 1511).\n\nAs far as more widespread networks go, though, the two most flexible and popular ways to obtain information were through ambassadors and messengers. Ambassadors made great spies first of all because of their freedom to travel, and second because by the very nature of their position they had access to people of at least some power. It's important to remember that in the days before news in the modern sense (a MASSIVE rumor mill, to be sure, but not journalism like today), \"espionage\" could mean gathering information simply about *what had happened*. The example I love is the English accusing Scotland of spying simply for knowing that the 1381 Peasants' Revolt had happened. (...)\n\nMessengers also had freedom to travel without suspicion and were a readily organized group. One aspect of their utility came in their carrying of *letters*. They could convey the information written down, but also, they were the ones who knew the *oral* component of messages--medieval letters were often mostly placeholders for the real message. But also, due to the freedom of movement, they might be instructed to peek into dark corners and bring back observations of what they saw. In general, wartime courier-spies were those who had the job during peacetime; they were approached and paid more when fighting threatened.\n\nIt wasn't unusual in medieval Europe for people to carry out long-distance, long-term friendships entirely by letter and messenger--never actually meeting in person. It stands to reason that long-distance spies would be recruited the same way--have a trusted messenger (ambassador, courier, merchant) and make sure they had ample money to buy some new loyalty.\n\nOh, yes--a not uncommon note in sources is recompense for a courier-spy who had been robbed along the way.\n\nETA: I offer some sources on espionage in the medieval world in [this earlier thread](_URL_0_)."

Not me personally, but some physicists are occasionally contacted by strange characters who have been working in their basement on some new idea, which turns out to be incorrect for many, many reasons (most of all, these lone desperados working in their basement don't seem to care much for results of experiments already performed or even making their own theory consistent with itself). \n\nSaying that scientists don't understand how gravity works or what is the mechanism of any fundamental force, and then proceeding to cast aside all of physics as rubbish needing replacement by their shaky, inconsistent, and unsupportable new theory, is a classic hallmark of crackpots. For good reason, this tactic appears on mathematical physicist John Baez's now-classic \"[Crackpot Index](_URL_1_)\" -- see number 17 (and 18):\n\n >  17. 10 points for arguing that while a current well-established theory predicts phenomena correctly, it doesn't explain \"why\" they occur, or fails to provide a \"mechanism\".\n\n >  18. 10 points for each favorable comparison of yourself to Einstein, or claim that special or general relativity are fundamentally misguided (without good evidence). \n\nJust as an example, years ago I read some of [this guy's](_URL_0_) writings.

                "The theory of General Relativity and the Einstein Field Equations which govern interactions between *macroscopic* particles are theoretically well understood.\n\nHowever, the Einstein Field Equations (EFE) are notoriously difficult to solve, and so for certain systems such as a single black hole one can make precise predictions. Solving more complex systems such as orbiting black holes is difficult and computational methods are being developed and refined. However, there is nothing in the data that suggests that General Relativity would not give a correct answer should you solve them.\n\nThere is a problem in trying to determine how quantum objects such as electrons interact gravitationally. For example, the gravitational interaction between two individual electrons cannot be handled by the theory of General Relativity as it stands as it only handles classical objects such as planets and galaxies. One can determine how a quantum particle will react to the gravitational field of a large classical object, which in the case of a black hole predicts Hawking radiation.\n\nThis problem of the gravitational interaction between two things such as electrons is currently a sort of philosophical one, as this interaction is so extremely weak given the small masses that current experiments cannot reach high enough energies to see such effects.\n\nHowever, all objects in the universe such as stars and galaxies are ultimately comprised of electrons and other quantum objects, so strictly speaking there is no ultimate theory that describes how gravitational interactions between large objects would emerge from the individual quantum interactions.\n\nFurthermore, one cannot \"quantize\" the gravitational field in terms of gravitons in the manner that one quantizes the electromagnetic field in terms of photons. These purely mathematical problems can apparently be solved by moving to a deeper mathematical framework called string theory, but so far no one has constructed a string theory that properly replicates all the other strong, weak, and electromagnetic interactions between known particles.

As for the second part (other unknowns)...\n\nIn psychiatry, there are many effective treatments for psychiatric illnesses, particularly mood disorders (depression and bipolar disorder).  However, nobody knows why these medications work.  Many of these medications are SSRIs, which increase the level of serotonin in the brain.  However, people with depression have normal levels of serotonin, so depression is not caused by low levels of serotonin.  In addition, it usually takes a few weeks to see any effect of these drugs, but the increase in serotonin happens within hours of starting the medication.\n\nFrom these observations, it is hypothesized that the effect of the medications has something to do with the downstream effects of increasing the level of serotonin, such as down-regulating serotonin receptors.  But there's no data for this, it's just speculation.\n\nOne of the reasons why genetic research of psychiatric illnesses is so important is because if a gene for a disorder is identified, it is then possible to figure out what the gene does, and then have a better idea of what is going on in the brain in a person with a psychiatric illness.

The difference in energy scale is large, like a leaf (matter) on the ocean (vacuum).\n\nIf you were to imagine that leaf as light pinwheel, then any light that does work in spinning (rest mass) that pinwheel will give up some energy, red-shifting it slightly.  In the presence of that pinwheel, the blue light from every other direction looks red in the direction of pinwheel - and an attraction arises from a vacuum pressure which is slightly dampened in the direction of mass - maybe analogous to the Casimir Force.\n_URL_0_\n\nI realize Bernard Haisch isn't popular, but I like his work.",

        "selftext": "The trivial answer is to \"go faster\" but why does that happen?\nWhat is actually involved that makes the boat go faster while rowing all in sync instead of alternatively?\n\n[edit] What I mean by alternatively, is, suppose the whole team (present on boat) is divided into 2 halves, A  &  B. To move through the water, first the team A pulls the boat (using their oars) and when they have finished their power stroke then team B does the pulling. So, when team A is done pulling it goes into its recovery phase. Meanwhile, team B pulls the boat. And then A again, and so on continuing as ABAB... (What I DON'T mean is half team is pulling for half the distance and other half for the left over distance).\n\n[edit 2]\nThank you for all your responses. \n\nSummary of the reasons (mentioned in the thread) rowing is done in sync and not otherwise:\n\nLimited Space on boat \t\n\n- Making it unable for rowers to go out of sync\n\n- The oars hitting one another\n\nBoat imbalance \t\n\n- Unnecessary stresses on the boat when rowers are going in opposite directions\n\n- Half rowers on one side in sync with each other but completely out-of-sync with the other side, make the boat go zig-zag, increasing the distance they're covering.\n\nHalf of the rowers pulling the weight of other half who are recovering, halves the acceleration (not exactly though), which is not desirable.\n\nSynchronization becomes unmanageable. \n\nWhile in recovery, rowers move in a direction opposite to the motion of boat, thus the pseudo force pushes the boat forward, slightly though. If the rowers were alternating, the motion of the rowers would cancel out and thus \nwasted.    \n\nWhen a boat is being rowed, if half the rowers have completed their pull, the water is set into motion, and some rower of the other half will be applying the force with the oar in moving-water, thus inefficiency in its application ",

Those boats are designed to have minimal drag so the gliding phase is less of a loss than losing 1/2 your power. \n\nAt least as far as I know.",

So if you aren't in sync, someone will get the end of an oar in the back.  Lastly, when you move forward to what they call \"the catch\" (the beginning of the rowing motion) that momentum actually slows the boat down, sometimes even jerking the boat backwards.  \n\nSource: rowed in high school and college",
                "The reason, besides oars colliding, is that more power in the stroke means more speed, which lifts the hull further out of the water, so there's less drag, which means even more speed.  It's like a multiplying effect.  Having people stroke at different times means the hull never lifts very much, so you don't get that increase in speed.\n\nSee also \"hull speed\".  It takes a lot less power to skim over the water than to push through it.",
                "TL;DR Not enough space, I think...\n\nI know I'm late, but it's also about space (at least with skulls). If you have some rowers idle, then their blades will be in the way. \nIf you watch the loci of each rower's blades, you can see that the only way that there would be enough space would be if the blades immediately behind (or in front) are pulled in, or not there.",
                "Efficiency increases when rowers are in sync. With the same expenditure in terms of energy, you get higher speed.\nI have first hand experience in paddling, and Dragon Boat in particular, but I assume he same is true for these sports.\nIf the rowers/paddlers on the two sides are out of sync, the boat will oscillate left and right, and a lot of energy is dissipated there. But also if the left/right part is balanced, you get higher efficiency if the thrust all rowers is applied at he same time. \n\nThe reason is that our muscles cannot apply the same power over all speed ranges. Power is speed times force. If you are rowing alone, you will have to apply a huge force, while your row moves very slowly. This is inefficient. If all rowers row at the same time, the speed of their movement can be higher. They apply less force, but the product force times speed, that is, the power, is higher.\n\nThink about a car engine working spin the wrong gear.",
                "This has somewhat been covered, but I thought I'd add a bit as someone with 8 years of rowing experience. What people dont tend to realize is that boat speed is just as much about accelerating the boat through the water on the drive (ie when the oar is actually pulling through the water) as it is about not slowing the boat down on the recovery. When rowers are out of sync on the recovery, even by a fraction of a second, they end up coming into the catch (where you place the oar into the water to begin the drive) too hard, or rather it will feel forced as different rowers try to stop their momentum in different ways and what not. This results in the bow of the boat being pushed down and a significant increase in drag applied to the boat. If a crew is significantly out of time with each other, it can feel almost as if the boat is coming to a stop every stroke, and thus the rowers are wasting a ton of energy just trying to get the boat back up to speed. Conversely, when all the rowers are rowing together and are perfectly in sync, the catch almost feels natural and easy, that is the rowers dont feel as if they have to force themselves to stop their forward momentum, thus keeping the bow of the boat up and allowing the rowers to pick the speed of the boat up quicker and to add more speed to the boat as they arent wasting time (and energy) getting the boat back to the speed it had during the recovery.  ",
                "It's about space (you can't move forward unless the person in front of you moves forward), balance and timing. \n\nAs others have said, all rowers have to be in sync for the boat to move smoothly and be balanced, but no one has mentioned that the cox is talking to the stroke (the rower closest to the cox) to dictate the stroke rate. Everyone else in the boat is following stroke's timing. If the cox says to increase / decrease the stroke rate, how will the 'B' rowers respond if they're not in sync? How would you do a 'power ten' for instance. \n\nAnother factor is the 'drive' and 'recovery' phases of the rowing stroke are not the same length, so A can't drive while B recovers, the timing wouldn't work. ",
                "A research team actually looked into it with robots: [here](_URL_0_)\n\nBasically the force of rowers pulling themselves back up to the catch pulls the boat forward which adds to their inertial force. When the rowers are not in sync the force is reduced. ",
                "Adding enough room to allow the feee movement would increase surface area and drag. More importantly while it might be faster to row like a centipede moving its legs it's too difficult to time this. At 44 strokes per minute the efficiency gained with his style would be negated by the lack of power each rower could produce. ",
                "A very simple answer is that if one oar was at the start of the stroke and the one behind it finishing the stroke they would probably collide.  So, the reason is so they don't collide the oars.\n\nThere might be other reasons but that seems to be reason enough.",
                "I'm not sure if the \"weight\" is relevant in the water, but I think 10 people dragging themselves without rest is better than 5 people dragging 10 people with rests, in a way. you're still going to spend the same amount of energy or even more. ",
                "The room issue as everyone mentioned, but also speed and there would also be a lot of swerving",
                " > The trivial answer is to \"go faster\" but why does that happen? What is actually involved that makes the boat go faster while rowing all in sync instead of alternatively?\n\n\nThe answer to this part of your question involves the movement of the water. When they all row at once, each paddle basically plunges into a solid wall of water that it can push off of. If they were alternating strokes, then each ore would hit water that is already circulating and moving backward (due to the strokes of the other paddles).\n\n\nTo put this in more real-life terms, imagine that you are pushing yourself forward off of the bumper of a car. If you're pushing yourself off of the bumper of a parked car, you will be propelled forward much more than if you push yourself off of the bumper of a car that is slowly traveling in reverse.",
                "Physics tells me that, given you can apply the same forward force even if split up, it's more efficient to do so. This is because drag force is relative to the velocity squared, so high velocity is punished harder than what you save from low velocity - keeping the average velocity is more efficient. I'm not sure how much difference this makes though. (1^2 +1^2 =2 while 0.5^2 +1.5^2 =2.5, 25% more drag force if you evenly shift between 0.5 and 1.5m/s compared to a constant 1m/s, although the average speed is still 1m/s)\n\nSo why don't they do that?\n\n1) As others have mentioned, there may simply not be space for the oars to be out of sync. While this is probably true, if it was more efficient, I imagine the boats would be designed for that, so I don't buy this fully as a single explanation.\n\nSo I'll add two other possible reasons, just speculations from my part:\n\n2) Being at the boats lowest speed when putting down the oars may also allow each rowman to add more force each stroke compared to if they put it down at a speed closer to the average, so my initial assumption may be incorrect.\n\n3) Being out of sync means some rowmen has to wait half a stroke into the race before starting to add their force, this sounds inefficient, it's likely that half the rowmen will put one less stroke into the water by the end of the race."

Older and younger slaves and women cost somewhat less.  A few skilled slaves, (blacksmiths, coopers, etc. ) could cost more.\n\nSo, a slave did cost about as much as a (good, new) car does today.\n\nSource: _URL_1_ p.199\n\nThe other investments needed to make a slave productive (on a cotton plantation) were about $450 per slave in land.  About $ 33per slave in tools and animals.\n\nThe cost of maintaining a prime field hand on a southern plantation in the period 1840 – 1860 is estimated at about $20-21/year.  (That would be roughly equivalent today to $580 today)\n\nA prime field hand produced about 3.5-4.5 bales of cotton/year.\nA bale is 500 lbs of cotton.\nThe average price for cotton was 7-8 cents / lb (to the plantation, not to the exporter).\nValue of one prime field hand’s cotton production = $150/yr.\n\nCapital to produce $150 in cotton = Slave $1200, Land $450, Tools $33 = $1683.\n\nCosts = $21/yr.\n\nProfit = $129 .\n\nReturn = 129/1683 = 7.7%\n\nSo, not surprisingly, slaves were profitable.  \n\nNote, this is a considerable oversimplification of the economics of slavery.  Some of the sources listed above go into considerably more detail.  All are estimates.  The economics of slavery in the American South after the ban on the slave trade seem to have been based on two systems: Cotton production in the Western South which had a continual demand for more slaves, and less profitable crops in the older Eastern South, which also produced a surplus of slaves which moved west.  More by younger sons taking some of the family’s slaves and colonizing west, than by sale of slaves “down the river” to the Cotton plantations, though both operated.\n"

                "Some people are going to call me crazy, but I'm going to explain as much as I can from my point of view.  \n\nFor reference, I lost about 40% of my hair and have grown most of it back.  A couple months from now, I should have all my hair back.  My doctor says these are results that do not happen. \n\nAnyways, there's 2 theories about hair loss.  The one you're referring to is the Donor theory/the androgen paradox.\n\n1) DHT levels rise as we age, and DHT causes hair in the MPB region to miniaturize (get smaller over time, detatching from the blood/nutrient source) because the hair is genetically predisposed to  DHT miniaturization.  It doesn't run in my family, so I became very skeptical.  \n\n2) The scalp becomes tight, causing reduced blood flow. \n\nNow, I'm putting my eggs into basket 2 because there are a lot of studies that seem to support this that cannot be explained by 1.  \n\n1 ) They took botox, injected it into Norwood 2-6's hair lines and around the MPB (the galea), and noticed that the hair started to grow back in a statistically significant fasion (aka, no way this should have happened if 1 were the true culprit).  \n\n2 ) Hair in the MPB is genetically the same as hair on the sides of your head.  Why would the MPB be genetically different?  Its not!  Its location is d ifferent and not located near muscle which absorbs DHT (like the sides of your head for instance).\n\n3) Oxygen levels in the MPB region are lower in balding patients, and free T is converted into DHT more in low oxygen environments. \n\n4) DHT is believed to cause muscles to \"harden,\" which would cause the galea to become tighter, and thus causing 3.\n\n5) All men go bald.  That is the truth.  If it were genetic, why would 95% of all men experience some DHT induced miniaturization? \n\n6) Rogaine works by increasing vasodialiation in that MPB region, thus, there is a link between bloodflow/oxygen/DHT accumulation that cannot be denied. \n\nDHT is certainly the culprit, but nuking your DHT body wide isn't the greatest thing, since it is really only about the DHT in your scalp.  DHT levels in MPB patients are not signficantly different than in non-balding patients, but it seems there is a high concentration in the scalp.  That being said, I still take propecia because fuck losing my hair.  \n\nIf you are experiencing balding and want to reverse it, I recommend the following: \n\n1) Get Regenepure 1%.  Use it daily.  Leave it on for 5 minutes. \n   \n2) Start taking 1mg finesteride daily. \n   \n3) Use Rosemary oil on your head after the regenepure and massage into the scalp vigorously instead of conditioner.  Rosemary oil is said to loosen up the scalp, and acts like Rogaine by acting on the NO pathways required for vasodialation.\n  \n 4) Massage your head and scalp throughout the day.  There are some exercises that are said to loosen the galea since your muscles need to become looser along your head.  I've noticed a big difference since I started them when I lost my hair. \n   \n5) There are some supplements that supposidly help.  I use them to work out anyway (L-argenine for instance).\n    \n6) 5% lipogaine.  I use it once at night, I use 2mL.  Mostly maintenance/ speed up the remaining hair I want to grow back.\n   \n7)  If you take creatine, stop.   While i loved it as a supplement, this may have been the cause of my early onset/non-history linked hairloss (which happened quickly).  Creatine causes DHT levels to rise dramatically supposedly.\n   ",

                "No. \n\nThis is a weird persistent \"fact\" that people love to bring up about the American Revolution and I've never been able to find a primary source that supports it. The earliest mention of the idea comes from an article in Harper's Magazine in 1896 -- a writer named Brander Matthews wrote about how odd it is that Franklin DIDN'T write the Declaration, and decided that it must have been because his colleagues were afraid he'd slip a joke in. (That article is called \"The Penalty Of Humor\" and is in Harper's Magazine Vol. 92.) It's a good story, but the truth is more complicated. \n\nThere was a committee of five chosen by Congress to draft the Declaration -- Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Roger Sherman, and Robert Livingston. The actual committee never took minutes of their meeting, and there are discrepancies between the accounts of Adams and Jefferson because the Declaration ended up being a much more influential document than anyone expected. At first it was viewed as an almost tedious administrative task; they weren't drafting the most important founding document in American history. In *Founding Brothers*, Joe Ellis suggests that Adams, had he known how important the Declaration would become, would have written it himself. (Adams's own writings support this, in my opinion -- later in life he insists that he rallied a bunch of others to vote that Jefferson write the Declaration, thus taking some of the credit for the document. \"I chose Jefferson to write it because I knew he'd do an awesome job\" sounds better than \"I made Jefferson do it because I felt it was beneath me.\" But Jefferson's recollection is that it was foisted on him because Adams couldn't really be bothered.) Ellis also says that Franklin loathed having his work edited by others, which is another reason he probably didn't care to write it. But the entire committee reviewed and made edits to Jefferson's original document, so Franklin was definitely involved. But no, he wasn't prevented from writing the whole thing because everyone was afraid he wouldn't take it seriously. That's a myth of Parson Weems proportions.\n\n(I've never commented on a thread in AskHistorians -- mods, I apologize if my sourcing isn't sufficient. I don't have my copy of the book on hand. Please delete if necessary!)\n\nEdit: here's a [link](_URL_0_) with an excerpt of Adams telling the \"I insisted Jefferson write it!\" story.",
                "As t he discussion wandered into important questions about the authorship, contemporary meaning and legal significance of the Declaration, I suggest reading Pauline Maier's celebrated and authoritative work, *American Scripture: Making the Declaration of Independence* (1997), and the brief summary she provided for a paper edition of the Declaration and Constitution. The Declaration was important as a political fact; the concluding paragraph that contains the actual declaration was what seemed important, and was read at Independence Day celebrations for decades. The now-famous opening paragraphs became famous and important later. Maier takes Jefferson down a bit for exaggerating both his role and the importance of his contributions to those opening paragraphs. . . . .  As to legal significance, lawyers today do not consider it to be a legal document, but there is an argument to be made that it was constitutive, possibly therefore part of the constitutional canon. Most of the state constitutions, including those that preceded the Declaration of Independence, began with declarations or rights, and Jefferson drew on those, especially the Virginia declaration of rights drafted primarily by George Mason."

                "Short answer - no, it can work.\n\nWith a lot of the early work on artificial hearts and assist devices it was assumed that blood flow had to be pulsatile - which makes sense given the use of stretch receptors in a lot of places to monitor pressure.\n\nHowever due to elasticity and resistance of the vessels, by capillary level a lot of the pulsatility has gone.\n\nIn the end this was solved by people making artificial hearts and assist devices which aren't pulsatile, and there are people walking around with them today.\n\nEdit: a fairly readable summary article - [The total artificial heart](_URL_0_)",
                "There is already a device out there that does what you are saying.  A lot of people with severe heart damage will get put on a device called an LVAD (Left Ventricular Assist Device) which can either assist a damaged heart or just replace it entirely.  These devices have a rotor that circulates blood continuously instead of making it pump.  It connects to a battery pack outside the body.  These people will often have no pulse and by extension no measurable blood pressure because there is no pulsitile motion to measure.  These devices are usually used as a temporary measure until a heart donor can be found, but it's getting more common to be used in those that cannot undergo a heart transplant as well.\nHere's some more info if you want to read about it.  \n\n_URL_0_\n\nI am an ED nurse at an LVAD center hospital so I see these fairly often.",
                "This already exists - it's called a left ventricular assist device (LVAD). It is implanted in people who's heart is too weak to effectively pump blood at a sufficient perfusion pressure. \n\nBasically it consists of a pipe with a motor in the middle. One end of the LVAD is hooked up to the heart (left ventricle), the other end is hooked up to the aorta (largest artery carrying blood to the rest of the body), and in the middle there is a motor which generates a negative pressure which sucks the blood out from the heart (assists the heart) and into the aorta. The motor speeds are adjusted to optimize the pressures in the heart. It is powered by a battery that is worn outside the body, but connects to the LVAD through the abdomen. \n\nIt is used in those who are waiting for a heart transplant but would otherwise die waiting. In some it’s also used as destination therapy (they are not candidates for a heart transplant but this will keep them alive longer than if they didn’t have an LVAD).\n\nComplications include hemolysis (shredding of red blood cells) due to the motor. There is also a high risk of infection and also clotting.\n\nRegarding pulsatile vs continuous flow - no one knows for sure. However, it has been shown that continuous flow can lead to more stiffening of blood vessels which is one theory behind why so many patients with LVADs have kidney failure later (but of course, the alternative is death relatively sooner).\n\nLVAD simulation: _URL_1_\n\nLVAD review article: _URL_2_\n\nLVAD Kidney: _URL_0_\n\n\n\n",
                "Look up LVAD. They are cool to look at, but if you need to be on one you’re in really, really bad shape. \n\nI did read some interesting things related to artificial hearts in one of my wife’s many medical journals that she gets. From an engineering standpoint, something with chambers that pump like an actual heart is much, much better. Other systems that would rely on blades to keep blood flowing damages cells and there’s the risk of buildup of cells on the blades. \n\nEdit: Sorry; LVAD was mentioned in another comment. ",
                "Extra corporeal membrane oxygenation, or ECMO, is a device that removes deoxygenated blood from the body and turns it into oxygenated blood via a huge pump and then returns it back to the body. In lay terms, long term heart and lung bypass. There are two kinds, VA and VV ECMO. VA or veno-arterial uses the venous system and the arterial system and can provide cardiac support; both the heart and lungs can rest while this pump does all the work. Then there's VV or veno-venous; it returns blood to venous system and provides no cardiac support, mainly for lungs to rest.\n\nI work at a children's hospital and we use ECMO in all three of our ICUs, the NICU, PICU, and CICU or cardiac.\n\nWiki for general info. _URL_0_\n\nNot sure if this answers the question of if we need a heart beat, but if capable, people can walk on ECMO and don't need to be restricted to a bed but obviously do need to be in hospital. LVADs I believe can be used outside of hospitals, people can go home with those.",
                "Cardiac care nurse here. There's a device called a VAD, which stands for a ventricular assistive device. Patient who receive them for their left ventricle; the largest chamber in the heart that pumps blood to the rest of the body, usually have them in place till they can get a heart transplant or long term as final therapy. The problem with using a pump and engine is that blood likes to clot and it often forms on the moving parts of the pump. We combat this by placing the patient on blood thinners, but this increases the risk of bleeding which is a high risk factor with VADs, more so with Left VADS. You also need to power the device. So VAD patients have an actual wire that comes out of the abdomen and plugs into a romote that runs off a battery or an outlet. Any foreign object entering the body is an invitation for infection and it's also a common risk factor with VADS. We also have total artificial hearts, witch are actually plastic chambers with valves that pump like a heart would. These are more rare and very loud because the machine that runs the device id constantly clicking and the external machine is about the size of a mini fridge.",
                "Okay, all of these answers are good, but they are very short-sighted to what the OP is asking. Yes, we have a system called a LVAD and it has complications. But come on scientists, think a little further down the road. Think to a time when we can manufacture a heart with small, but powerful batteries, motors, etc that could last indefinitely.\n\nShould that future synthetic heart be programmed to beat or simply flow as the OP is asking? What would be the pros/cons of an \"everflow\" system? If an engineer could design the ideal heart without energy constraints (which is why we have a beat to begin with; saving energy), what would it look like?",
                "I'm a med student and we've had a lecture not long ago about heart transplant and artificial hearts. The answer is that we really aren't sure yet, whether the pulse does anything. As others have mentioned, there are devices (LVADs) that are simply compressors and that pump blood in continuous fashion (ie. without pulse). And people can live with them. But there isn't enough evidence to say for sure, whether having a pulsile flow is beneficial or not. Some experts suggest, that pulse is useful for lymph drainage, since lymph flow is kind of passive. But it seems it definitely is possible to live without a pulse, and as far as I know, most research is currently focused on advancing continuous flow heart pumps, since they seem to be simpler/more practical.",
                "Sorry for formatting and bad English.\n\nYes, we could use a continuous pump, and everyone here told you to look after LVAD.\n\nThere's also another problem: laminar flow and turbolent flow of the blood.\n\nIn laminar flow, the blood moves without making whirls, like water in a straight tube.\n\nIn turbolent flow, the blood may become stagnant in critical points, such as right after heart valves. The stagnation leads to the formation of clots in that area, with potentially fatal consequences.\n\nIt takes time for a liquid to create turbolence.\nA pulsed movement of the blood \"kills\" the turbolence before it becomes too important.\n\nSource: biomedical engineering student and thesis on valve failure",
                "Yes it is possible. You can live with a pump that provides a constat stream (i.e without s heartbeat)\n\n[This man lived — even played basketball — without a human heart for 555 days before receiving a transplant](_URL_0_) ",
                "How is your cardio when you have one of these devices in. Say you’re perfectly healthy and have no complications from the machine, could you for example run forever? Or do strenuous activity for insanely long periods of time?",
                "I was on a plane to Houston with a cardiologist who is working the latest generation of this. I asked lots of questions and this question was the first. He said the body doesn't need the pulse, just flow. The device they were working on would speed up and slow down based on need, like a regular heart.

                "I worked for a major manufacturer of LVADs for over 10 years, and a lot of studies were done regarding organ function in the absence of pulsatile flow, etc. Turns out, you don't need a pulse!\n\nNevertheless, the newest device actually has a pulsatile mode. Also, many patients retain at least SOME heart function, so even with a continuous flow device many will still have some degree of pulse.",
                "You could totally replace a heart with something that moves blood around, the issue you will run into is the heart is the epitome of an industrial machine. It's beating constantly with no maintenance for 80ish years. If you can manufacture something that does that, you win a few billion dollars.  ",
                "Devices exist which do this however the structure of the circulatory system doesn’t seem to love them and they only keep people afloat for a few years or so.\n\nWe couldn’t tell you what combination of pulseless circulation versus the heart and circulatory system having already been in bad shape necessitating the device... but it’s typically used a temporary measure rather than something an elite athlete would be interested in.",
                "It’s possible with an Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation machine.  ECMOs are increasingly being used in hospitals when patients need organ transplants and can no longer stay alive on their own.   Not sure if that’s entirely the same thing... people can go ahead and contradict me.  ",
                "A lot of people have already pointed out that LVADs are already a thing but one in particular is the Heart Mate. The Heart Mate II was the first widespread used of the line which uses a pump with constant pressure. Worked pretty well for people with heart failure who either aren't candidates for a heart transplant or wont live long enough to get one without support. Plus side is its compact and you can live a fairly normal life with it. Down side is all LVADs require constant anticoagulant therapy (heparin for example to prevent clots in the pump) and with the constant pressure it has an extremely heightened risk for GI bleeds and strokes. Enter the Heart Mate III which added pulsatility to the pump (constant pulse of ~40). Lower risk of stroke but still requires anticoagulant therapy. The Heart Mate II is still used because (I think) the III just finished trial and has strict requirements. Basically just looks like a small pump attached to the heart with a couple foot of garden house sitting in the abdomen. I work in a mediumish sized CVICU and we get a handful of these placed a week.",
                "Not sure if someone already posted this, but former Vice President Dick Cheney has a heart pump device (no pulse) simply circulates the blood. So as others have noted an implantable blood circulatory device does already exist and is able to keep a person alive for a significant amount of time barring other medical issues or complications. ",
                "Continuous-flow total artificial heart, was first done in 2011 in Houston Texas.. The patient had no pulse, he was fully awake interacting with family and medical staff for more than a month. The body can be sustained on a continuous flow simply because blood flows continuously at the capillary level. \n\n[medical team press conference](_URL_0_)\n\n[article in popular science](_URL_1_)",
                "Some studies say that the pressure pulses created by heart flushes metabolism products from the fluid space between brain cells. Another factor is breathing. Without these we are probably more prone to become cognitively impaired (dementia, alzheimers, ms-disease).",
                "I worked in blood vessel tissue engineering. What I know about endothelial cells is that they respond best to non-continuoua flow. I do not remember all the details of my studies but my intuition is that pulsatile stretching of the cell walls is also better.\n\nBasically, the heart and blood vessels have evolved to work together, and they work better this way. That doesn't mean a continuous blood flow would be a death sentence, but I would expect a list of negative consequences such as poorer blood flow regulation, fewer anti-clotting factors, weaker vascular walls (perhaps accompanied by media hypertrophy and higher blood pressure? No idea), etc.",
                "Precepted at an LVAD clinic. The primary complication is arteriovenous malformations. From my understanding the continuous flow doesn’t allow the capillaries to relax and you get ballooning of blood vessels esp in the gut. \n\n_URL_0_",
                "You also need the beat of your heart, the difference in pressure of the heart beat (systolic  &  diastolic pressure) is what allows your heart to get blood. \n\nEssentially, the difference in pressure causes a backflow of blood in the most proximal aorta, backing up to the aortic valve and the coronary arteries are right there so the blood flows into the coronary arteries to feed the heart. \n\nAdditionally the relaxation of the heart, the diastolic pressure allows a pressure gradient to have the blood go from there coronary arteries into the musculature of the heart. ",
                "It's been done. The heart beat is not required by other systems in the body, merely a sustained flow of oxygenated blood.\n\nThe creepy thing is a lack of pulse, considered a defining characteristic of life, both literal and poetic, since time immemorial.",
                "No, the heart does not need to beat.\n\nThe reason it beats is because the limitations of muscle. Muscle can’t rotate on an axis to create a rotor pump. It can only contract and uncontract. The signal along the SA node and purkinjie fibers makes the heart contract, and this contraction forces blood out of the high pressure area to low pressure. \n\nThis process is what makes your heart “beat”. However this beat isn’t essential. \n\nBlood is vital because it carries nutrients, and oxygen. However there is nothing special about the delivery system. It’s just diffusion. As long as blood is moving, constantly picking up new nutrients, and new oxygen and getting rid of waste you will function. \n\nTL;DR \nNo, your heart doesn’t need to beat. Since blood gives out nutrients and oxygen through diffusion a constant flow would be completely compatible with the body.",
                "Don’t have time for reading comments now but great question! Yes this works but there are a lot of unknown and partially known tid bits I’d imagine this would affect.  Movement and activity for example are very important in circulating stuffs. So the pulsation probably helps keep things from stacking up or plugging up. "

                "Part of it is practice; they know what they want to build/design/create, and have used the software to do it for a while.  They know all the hotkeys and keyboard shortcuts to do stuff very quickly.\n\nAnother part of it is the relative amount of detail.  Your 3D screw probably had individual threads in the polygons, but for a video game that amount of detail wouldn't really be necessary - they could make a simple 3D screw out of a cylinder with a few easy tweaks, and work with a texture artist (if they aren't doing the texture themselves) to put threads on it - bonus points for normal maps to give the threads depth on an otherwise flat surface.\n\nWith creating worlds/objects, they'll often design  &  build a *ton* of similar assets, and plop them somewhere in the game world.  There's a reason why Skyrim has a lot of the \"same\" look in places - they're not going to design a ton of different wheel barrows when one or two \"functional\" ones and a few different \"ruined\" ones to use when building an area.\n\nAnimations are a bit different but come down to much of the same idea; practice  &  using the same animation for multiple instances.  Looking at Skyrim again, they only had to make a few \"sword swing\" animations that pretty much every human enemy uses when swinging a sword - instead of having the big muscular humans swing differently than the scrawny ones, or a warrior swinging differently than an archer.",

Then he simulated a thousand  dropping and flying and bouncing, again, something like 5 minutes to do.\n\nThe fact is when you know how to use tools like Maya, making a model is about as fast as painting. That is you can make a smiley face in 30 seconds, but a finished product you sell might be a few days work. Video game developers have multiple people with skills doing this, and also heavily use copy/pasting. So they might spend 2 weeks 30 models of trees, and the maps can have 1 million trees, but it's just a script that took a day to write that placed the trees in reasonable locations using the 30 models."

                "I assume your question asks about why the oxygen concentration decreases with depth in the ocean.  If not, please clarify.\n\nAtmospheric oxygen equilibrates with the ocean at the seawater/atmosphere interface.  Whatever temperature and pressure are for a given water mass is when it is at the surface defines its starting oxygen concentration.  If the water then cools and becomes more dense it sinks.  It does not increase in oxygen concentration since there is no source of additional oxygen.\n\nOxygen is consumed by biological processes, i.e respiration.  As organic matter is metabolized it consumes oxygen.  Organic matter falls through the water column and as it is consumed it must use oxygen whether the consumer is a microorganism or other heterotroph.\n\n\nTherefore, as you get deeper, the \"older\" water, that is water that has been away from the surface longer, decreases in oxygen concentration.  In fact, when there is abundant surface productivity raining down organic matter it can drive the oxygen concentration all the way to zero, creating so-called \"dead zones\".\n\n[Apparent Oxygen Utilization](_URL_1_) is a handy tool to measure productivity.\n\n > In freshwater or marine systems Apparent Oxygen Utilization (AOU) is the difference between the measured dissolved oxygen concentration and its equilibrium saturation concentration in water with the same physical and chemical properties. Such differences typically occur when biological activity acts to change the ambient concentration of oxygen. For example, primary production liberates oxygen and increases its concentration, while respiration consumes it and decreases its concentration.\n\n > Consequently, the AOU of a water sample represents the sum of the biological activity that the sample has experienced since it was last in equilibrium with the atmosphere. In shallow water systems (e.g. lakes), the full water column is generally in close contact with the atmosphere, so oxygen concentrations are typically close to saturation: AOU values are low. In deep water systems (e.g. oceans), water can be out of contact with the atmosphere for extremely long periods of time (years, decades, centuries) and large AOU values are possible.\n\nedit: OK!  so, I went to r/science *after* reading r/askscience questions.  I now assume your question relates to this post: _URL_0_  \n\nIn any case, the answer is well provided there: as the ocean warms the water can dissolve less oxygen:\n\n > Ocean models predict a decline in the dissolved oxygen inventory of the global ocean of one to seven per cent by the year 2100, caused by a combination of a warming-induced decline in oxygen solubility and reduced ventilation of the deep ocean.\n\n",
                "Basically you assume oxygen has higher solubility in water as temperature increases but, unlike solids like salt or sugar, gases are much less soluble at higher temperatures. De-gassing water to prevent corrosion or make very clear ice is done by repeatedly boiling and cooling water. So yeah : higher temperatures = less oxygen in water."
